[{"author": "Ben Jacobs In Washington", "body": "The White House said it \u201capplauded\u201d pro-gun control demonstrators at the March for Our Lives on Saturday without directly addressing their calls for stricter gun regulation, although Donald Trump did not weigh in on Twitter, as he is prone to do.\n\n\u201cWe applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their first amendment rights today,\u201d said White House spokesperson Lindsey Walters.\n\nShe added: \u201cKeeping our children safe is a top priority of the president\u2019s, which is why he urged Congress to pass the Fix Nics and Stop School Violence Acts, and signed them into law. Additionally, on Friday, the Department of Justice issued the rule to ban bump stocks following through on the president\u2019s commitment to ban devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.\u201d\n\nTrump spent much of the morning at the Trump International golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The White House did not respond to questions about his activities there.\n\nThe Fix Nics 2017 Act would tighten the country\u2019s background checks system. Nics stands for the National Instant Background Checks System. The legislation provides federal agencies with a few more incentives to submit records to the background check system \u2013 something they are already required by law to do.\n\nThe Stop School Violence Act would authorize $50m in grant funding for campus safety improvements, including training for local law enforcement and faculty and the development of an anonymous reporting system to identify early warning signs of potential threats.\n\nBoth pieces of legislation were part of the omnibus government bill that Trump signed on Friday.\n\nOther politicians from both sides of the partisan divide weighed in as well. Florida senator Marco Rubio said in a statement: \u201cI commend those who today are peacefully exercising their first amendment rights to march in favor of a gun ban.\u201d\n\nRubio, who came under criticism from survivors of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in a televised town hall on CNN, added: \u201cWhile I do not agree with all of the solutions they propose, I respect their views and recognize that many Americans support certain gun bans. However, many other Americans do not support a gun ban. They too want to prevent mass shootings, but view banning guns as an infringement on the second amendment rights of law abiding citizens that ultimately will not prevent these tragedies.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, a number of Democrats actively participated in marches held across the country.Senators Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota were among those who marched in Washington. Senator Sherrod Brown attended an event in Cleveland and Senator Elizabeth Warren attended an event in Boston. Barack Obama also expressed his support on Twitter, saying: \u201cMichelle and I are so inspired by all the young people who made today\u2019s marches happen. Keep at it. You\u2019re leading us forward. Nothing can stand in the way of millions of voices calling for change.\u201d\n\nTrump, who ran as a strong supporter of gun rights, has taken several different positions on new legislation in the aftermath of the Florida shooting. Most recently, he proposed arming teachers while backing away from earlier statements about raising the legal age to purchase a semi-automatic weapon to 21.\n\nOn Friday, the US justice department proposed rule changes that would effectively ban bump stocks, devices that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like a machinegun. Bump stocks were used by Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock to kill 58 people in the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history. Trump heralded the DoJ\u2019s move on Twitter by saying: \u201cWe will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.\u201d\n\nTrump has also proposed extreme risk protection orders, which would provide law enforcement and family members with a legal way to petition a court to temporarily remove an unstable person\u2019s guns, and block them from buying new ones.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Sam Levin In San Francisco", "body": "The White House has announced orders to formally ban transgender people from serving in the military, following up on Donald Trump\u2019s controversial policy pledge that sparked widespread backlash last year from civil rights groups and US defense chiefs.\n\nDespite opposition from top military officials and previous rulings against the ban, which LGBT rights groups have challenged in court, a memo from the secretary of defense released late Friday night said trans people are \u201cdisqualified from military service except under certain limited circumstances\u201d.\n\nThe memo did not elaborate on possible exceptions, but said the secretary of defense and secretary of homeland security \u201cmay exercise their authority to implement any appropriate policies concerning military service by transgender individuals\u201d.\n\nThe announcement claimed that the policy was \u201cdeveloped through extensive study by senior uniformed and civilian leaders\u201d and said that based on the advice of \u201cexperts\u201d, the administration has concluded that the \u201caccession or retention\u201d of trans people \u201cpresents considerable risk to military effectiveness and lethality\u201d.\n\nWhen Trump originally announced the ban on Twitter, he claimed that the military \u201ccannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption\u201d of trans service members, despite the fact that studies have found that the ban would have negative impacts on the military.\n\nCritics have argued that the discriminatory policy will cause significant disruptions in the military, force trans members to hide their identities, deprive the military of talented people and reinforce harmful and inaccurate stereotypes about trans people. The president\u2019s orders have reversed Barack Obama\u2019s policy in 2016, which ended a longstanding rule barring trans people from serving openly in the military.\n\n\u201cWhat the White House has released tonight is transphobia masquerading as policy. This policy is not based on an evaluation of new evidence,\u201d Joshua Block, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s LGBT and HIV Project, said in a statement Friday night. \u201cIt is reverse-engineered for the sole purpose of carrying out President Trump\u2019s reckless and unconstitutional ban, undermining the ability of transgender service members to serve openly and military readiness as a whole.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s directive was already blocked by federal courts in four separate cases, including an ACLU lawsuit, the group noted.\n\n\u201cThe policy effectively coerces transgender people who wish to serve into choosing between their humanity and their country,\u201d Block said. \u201cTransgender people in our military deserve more from their government than a myth-driven proclamation about their unfitness for full civic inclusion.\u201d\n\nSarah McBride, the national press secretary with the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBTQ rights group in the US, also condemned the policy in a statement, saying: \u201cReleasing this news under cover of darkness late on a Friday night means thousands of transgender troops will wake up tomorrow with their lives turned upside down. This couldn\u2019t be more cowardly or wrong.\u201d\n\nNumerous Republican senators, including John McCain, Susan Collins and Orrin Hatch, have criticized the policy, and more than 50 retired generals and admirals signed a letter saying the ban would degrade military readiness.\n\nTrump has also rescinded Obama-era protections for trans students, and vice-president Mike Pence has a long history of backing anti-LGBT policies.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Carole Cadwalladr. Portrait By Antonio Olmos", "body": "When I first met Shahmir Sanni last August, he was nervy, anxious, uncertain. \u201cI\u2019ve just started piecing it together,\u201d he said, in what was our first off-the-record conversation. \u201cAll this stuff I didn\u2019t realise at the time.\u201d Stuff that a series of investigations and news articles had forced him to start thinking about. \u201cWas I just really naive?\u201d he asked. Then later: \u201cDo you think they just used me?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a painful question for Sanni, one that he\u2019s struggled with over a period of months. Now, though, he thinks that, yes, he was used; that he and his friend, Darren Grimes, were taken advantage of by people they respected and trusted, and that the consequences of it are profound, far reaching, and go well beyond his own personal feelings of hurt and betrayal.\n\nIn early 2016, Sanni was a 22-year-old recent graduate, volunteering with Vote Leave, the official campaign to leave the European Union led by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. It was one of his first pieces of work experience after graduating from the University of East Anglia with a degree in economics, and for someone who describes himself as a \u201cnatural Eurosceptic\u201d it was a plum role. \u201cIt was like a startup. Everyone was throwing ideas around and saying different things. You\u2019re given a lot of creative freedom.\u201d He was still living at home in Solihull, but was travelling in by train, a few days each week, to work in Vote Leave\u2019s headquarters at Millbank Tower in London, overlooking the Thames.\n\nVote Leave\u2019s senior directors were quick to realise how useful he would be for the campaign. \u201cA huge part of campaigns is to make sure you diversify,\u201d says Sanni. \u201cAnd we discussed how crucial it was that Vote Leave didn\u2019t appear racist.\u201d\n\nSo, it was: \u201cHere\u2019s the brown guy\u201d?\n\nIt was a role he was happy to play, though, helping with their black and ethnic minority outreach efforts. \u201cAt university all my friends were \u2018Remain, Remain, Remain\u2019, but when I started doing research into it, I realised I\u2019m a nerdy Eurosceptic. And even after all this, I would still vote Leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll this\u201d is why Sanni is talking today. Because it\u2019s what happened next that\u2019s the issue \u2013 a sequence of events that began in March 2016, when one of Vote Leave\u2019s senior directors, Stephen Parkinson, who is now Theresa May\u2019s political secretary, asked Sanni if he would be interested in helping with one of Vote Leave\u2019s official youth groups, BeLeave.\n\n\u201cBeLeave was very progressive; it was aimed at young, liberal Leavers. They were talking about African farmers being discriminated against\u2026 it totally aligned with my values.\u201d\n\nBeLeave had been set up and was being run from within Vote Leave\u2019s HQ by another volunteer, 23-year-old fashion student Darren Grimes, whose main role was creating ads and messaging to share on social media. \u201cHis content was just really, really good. They were just cool, simple graphics that people would share. His creative side shone through. Everyone recognised that.\u201d\n\nSanni continued to campaign for Vote Leave, but he was also now helping BeLeave. Then about a month before the referendum, \u201cCleo tells us someone, a sponsor, wants to give money to BeLeave\u201d.\n\nThis was Cleo Watson, another senior director at Vote Leave \u2013 its head of outreach. Now, like Parkinson, Watson works at No 10 Downing Street, as political adviser to Theresa May.\n\nWhen Watson said a donor had expressed interest in giving money to BeLeave so it could expand its work, Sanni and Grimes wrote a proposal. They could treble the impact of their Facebook content, they reckoned, if they could get a few thousand pounds to spend on ads. \u201cWe were like: \u2018If we had \u00a310,000, this is what we could do: we could have X number of paid adverts and reach so many people.\u2019\u201d\n\nWatson told them they needed to speak to Vote Leave\u2019s internal lawyer and head of compliance. \u201cAnd he said the only way to get money was to set [BeLeave] up as a separate organisation. So, we were like: \u2018OK, cool. How do we do that?\u2019 And so he wrote up the constitution for us. And Darren put his own name on it. Because that\u2019s what he was told to do.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer helped Sanni and Grimes to draw up the documents, which they signed on 18 May, and he told them to open a bank account.\n\nBut no donor ever materialised. Later, in the crucial final fortnight before the referendum, the talk in the Vote Leave office was about how the campaign was both running out of money and about to hit its spending limit of \u00a37m. And then, 10 days before the referendum, Vote Leave learned that they had received a donation of \u00a31m. Because of their spending limits, they suggested this could be given as a donation to BeLeave. Not the few thousand pounds they had asked for, though. The proposed sum was initially \u00a3400,000 but ended up close to \u00a3700,000.\n\nWhat was your reaction?\n\n\u201cWe were ecstatic. It was amazing. Can you imagine\u2026 you\u2019re 22 and you\u2019re given nearly a million pounds? I think I added that to my LinkedIn profile that same day.\u201d\n\nToday, though, for Sanni, that campaign, the money, the creative work, and everything associated with it is tainted. What he has spent months coming to terms with is that this donation may not have had anything to do with BeLeave\u2019s creativity and flair. \u201cVote Leave didn\u2019t really give us that money,\u201d he says. \u201cThey just pretended to. We had no control over it. We were 22-year-old students. You\u2019re not going to just give nearly a million pounds to a pair of students and let them do whatever.\u201d\n\nTo Sanni\u2019s mind, what this means is: \u201cThey cheated.\u201d\n\nThe question is whether this was a strategy to get around the strict electoral spending limits enforced by law. If election campaigns coordinate, they have to declare their spending together. Spending limits are the bedrock of our parliamentary democracy: our electoral laws control the amount of money that can be spent in elections \u2013 which for the official designated campaign group is \u00a37m. But a perfectly legal loophole exists: separate campaigns can spend up to \u00a3700,000 in excess of that. Just as long as they don\u2019t co-ordinate \u2013 or, in the Electoral Commission\u2019s words, \u201cwork together\u201d.\n\nSo was BeLeave a separate campaign? Vote Leave insist it was and the Electoral Commission agreed back in April 2017. But Sanni \u2013 and he has a wealth of documents \u2013 now thinks it wasn\u2019t. He believes BeLeave \u201cworked together\u201d with Vote Leave.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lie. The whole thing. It was never separate.\u201d And he has a whole dossier of emails, text messages and other files. What\u2019s more: \u201cThey told us to set up the bank account, but no money ever went into it. I was the treasurer and secretary of BeLeave and I never saw the money. I had no control over it. It was Vote Leave who decided everything.\u201d The money went straight to Vote Leave\u2019s Canadian data analytics firm \u2013 AggregateIQ (AIQ).\n\nIt\u2019s an extraordinary revelation. The Observer has been one of a number of publications and campaign groups that have picked away at the story behind this donation. Because one thing is clear: something smelled bad. It\u2019s been the subject of two Electoral Commission investigations, an inquiry by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, numerous Freedom of Information requests, multiple articles and a judicial review. The latest investigation is still live. And nobody has yet been able to answer the question posed in the very first article by BuzzFeed on 2 August 2016: \u201cWhy did Vote Leave donate \u00a3625,000 to a 23-year-old fashion student during the referendum?\u201d\n\nUntil now. Because Sanni knows exactly why. \u201cWe were two broke college students. Darren\u2019s working-class as well. And it\u2019s his name all over this. He\u2019s the one being investigated. It\u2019s his name on the form. And he just did what Vote Leave told him.\u201d\n\nSanni is quite profoundly anti-Europe. He doesn\u2019t believe in what he calls EU \u201cpassport discrimination\u201d. And having moved here from Pakistan, he loves this country with the passion that, he says, maybe only an immigrant can feel. \u201cBritain saved my family,\u201d he says. \u201cI voted Leave. And if there was a second referendum, I would vote Leave again. But I now know my vote was based on cheating. And that\u2019s what I cannot stand.\u201d\n\nTo say it\u2019s a brave decision to come forward is a huge understatement. Sanni is still only 24. The CEO of Vote Leave, Matthew Elliott, is the co-founder of the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, where Sanni works on pro-Brexit social media messaging. And a lot of his friends are still in that same pro-Brexit world, including Darren Grimes, who now works for another Matthew Elliott outfit, the website BrexitCentral.\n\nSanni lives in BrexitLand. His career has been built on Brexit. And his decision to come forward has been far from straightforward. Back in August, we discussed him going on the record anonymously, but even that felt too risky. He was worried about his mother \u2013 a teacher who came to Britain as a single mother from Pakistan less than a decade ago \u2013 and his two sisters. But it\u2019s also part of what has prompted his decision.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from Pakistan. And for someone that came here seeking a new life, a better life, one where my mum and my sisters could live freely, in a country where my decision as a voter actually matters and is truthful\u2026 this is a huge deal.\u201d\n\nThe first inkling that something wasn\u2019t right came when journalists from BuzzFeed and Private Eye got sight of BeLeave\u2019s audit to the Electoral Commission and found what BuzzFeed noted was \u201ca highly unusual transfer of funds\u201d. Namely that Darren Grimes was recorded as having received a total of \u00a3675,315 in four donations spread over eight days shortly before polling day \u2013 on 13, 16, 20 and 21 June.\n\nSanni shrugged it off. \u201cI just thought: \u2018Oh, this is how politics is. It\u2019s remoaners trying to smear us and our hard work.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Grimes was less sanguine. Sanni still has his Facebook messages, which show his confusion and panic. \u201cI\u2019ve had three journalists this morning,\u201d one says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should go back to GP and be like I\u2019m dying or just fight through it.\u201d (A reference, Sanni says, to the state of his health.) Grimes then forwarded an email he\u2019d received from a Vote Leave director: \u201cSo as discussed we think you should refuse to speak to hacks about it and just email them something like this: \u2018We received donations in a standard legal way and have reported them according to the rules.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the BuzzFeed article, Grimes says: \u201cWe received donations in a standard legal way and have reported them according to the rules.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s Sanni believes, and says is reflected in the multiple pages of evidence that he has gathered, is that Vote Leave directed BeLeave\u2019s actions before it became a separate campaign, after it became a separate campaign, and throughout the referendum.\n\nWhat\u2019s also clear, in the pages of messages from Grimes, is how the donation \u2013 which has put him front and centre of the media coverage \u2013 has affected him. His messages to Sanni make distressing reading. As a teenager, Grimes was bullied. He grew up in a working-class community in County Durham, and Sanni describes him as sensitive and vulnerable to criticism.\n\nWhen the letter arrived from the Electoral Commission, announcing it needed to make an \u201cassessment\u201d, he really started to panic. \u201cHe rang me up and told me to delete my emails. I didn\u2019t understand it. I said: \u2018We\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019 But he was panicking. So I just did it.\u201d\n\nSanni still had no inkling that there was anything seriously amiss. \u201cWe were advised every step of the way by Vote Leave\u2019s lawyers. They literally told us what to do and where to sign. I couldn\u2019t understand how we had done anything wrong.\u201d\n\nAnd then he found the drive: a shared Google drive that Vote Leave had set up and that has every appearance of being a smoking gun. It\u2019s here that Grimes and Sanni shared content with key Vote Leave directors, including campaign director Dominic Cummings, and Vote Leave\u2019s data analytics firm, AIQ.\n\n\u201cI looked at it and I thought \u2018Oh, my God.\u2019 That\u2019s when I realised things were serious. I was, \u2018OK, this is really fucked up.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat Sanni realised was that on 17 March 2017, Victoria Woodcock, the chief operating officer of Vote Leave, went through the drive and deleted herself, Cummings and Vote Leave\u2019s digital director, Henry de Zoete, from more than 100 files. However the system logged a record of her activity. It is not known whether or not she was acting under instruction.\n\nThis was 17 days after the Electoral Commission had written to Vote Leave and Darren Grimes, telling them that it was opening an investigation into the donation. And 13 days after the Observer had announced the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office was launching an inquiry into the use of data in the referendum.\n\nTo Sanni it was obvious that something was seriously amiss \u2013 that this was evidence that had been deleted. Woodcock had painstakingly gone through the files one by one, and removed their names from them. Not one or two, but 140 of them. On a blog post published on Friday, Cummings says this is \u201cfactually wrong and libellous\u201d. Vote Leave say staff acted \u201cethically, responsibly and legally in deleting any data\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat did you do when you saw that on the drive?\u201d I ask Sanni.\n\nI\u2019ve spent countless hours this year talking to Christopher Wylie, and it was through him that I first heard about Shahmir Sanni\u2019s role in the EU referendum. Wylie is the whistleblower whose revelations in the Observer last weekend about Cambridge Analytica and Facebook precipitated such an astonishing global fallout. Cambridge Analytica\u2019s CEO, Alexander Nix, has been suspended, while at one stage Facebook saw around $60bn wiped off its share price. On Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg apologised.\n\nChristopher Wylie is not just at the heart of the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook scandal. He\u2019s at the heart of Brexit too.\n\nIt was Wylie who introduced both Sanni and Grimes to Vote Leave. Politics is a small world, and Wylie\u2019s work with the Lib Dems in the coalition government had brought him into contact with both Lib Dems and Tories. Grimes and Sanni were both friends of Wylie, and it was he who introduced them to Stephen Parkinson of Vote Leave. In a statement released this week, Stephen Parkinson said: \u201cI was not introduced to Shahmir Sanni or Darren Grimes by Chris Wylie as he is claiming, but by a mutual friend from university.\u201d\n\nIt is Wylie\u2019s role elsewhere that is pivotal. Because he didn\u2019t just play a founding role in setting up Cambridge Analytica: he also helped in the setting up of AIQ, the Canadian data services and \u201cdigital advertising\u201d firm to which Vote Leave allocated 40% of its \u00a36.8m spend.\n\nIn February last year, I wrote my first report about Cambridge Analytica, interrogating what work it had done for Nigel Farage\u2019s Leave.EU campaign. It kicked off two investigations into Cambridge Analytica\u2019s role in Brexit: one by the Electoral Commission into its work for Leave.EU; the other by the ICO into how it used data. Since then, both organisations have denied that Cambridge Analytica did any paid or unpaid work for Leave.EU. However, on Friday, a former director of the data firm, Brittany Kaiser, said she was told to deny any work had been done. \u201cIn my opinion, I was lying,\u201d she said. \u201dI felt like we should say \u2018this is exactly what we did\u2019.\u201d This is consistent with what I have been reporting for more than a year.\n\nIn March, after the first article was published, I got a tip-off. Vote Leave \u2013 the official leave campaign group in the referendum \u2013 was entirely separate from Leave.EU, but the data analytics firm Vote Leave used, AIQ, was linked to SCL Elections, the parent company that set up Cambridge Analytica with Robert Mercer\u2019s funds. AIQ was until last year listed on its website as \u201cSCL Canada\u201d.\n\nIt was my attempt to prove this, to figure out the link, that first led me to Wylie. \u201cIf you want to understand where Canada fits into this,\u201d an ex-employee of Cambridge Analytica told me, \u201cyou need to find Christopher Wylie.\u201d So I did.\n\nWylie was the key to understanding how Cambridge Analytica had harvested upwards of 50m Facebook profiles. And he was the key to understanding the link between Cambridge Analytica and AIQ.\n\n\u201cI helped set up AIQ in 2013,\u201d he told me in our first conversation. \u201cThey\u2019re my friends. We needed someone to build Cambridge Analytica\u2019s technology platform and manage their databases, and I asked my friend Jeff.\u201d\n\nJeff Silvester was Wylie\u2019s first employer, a man he had known since he was 16 and who went on to co-found AIQ. Last May, Wylie showed me a document that proved the link: an intellectual property agreement that showed SCL Elections owned AIQ\u2019s IP \u201cin perpetuity\u201d. This document shows the link between Cambridge Analytica and AIQ. Between Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon and Brexit. What\u2019s more, says Wylie, AIQ deployed the algorithms that Cambridge Analytica built. \u201cAIQ managed Ripon, Cambridge Analytica\u2019s platform, and built a lot of the tech to connect the algorithms to social and online advertising networks.\u201d In response to our questions, AggregateIQ said: \u201cAggregateIQ has always been 100 per cent Canadian owned and operated. AggregateIQ never worked or even communicated in anyway with Cambridge Analytica, or any other parties related to Cambridge Analytica, with respect to the Brexit campaign.\u201d\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, almost all of AIQ\u2019s work came via Cambridge Analytica. They worked closely with Cambridge Analytica\u2019s vice-president, Steve Bannon, on multiple political campaigns in the US. \u201cBannon was always interested in Brexit,\u201d says Wylie. \u201cHe saw Britain as a cultural leader. And where Britain led, America would follow.\u201d\n\nIn total, \u00a33.9m of leave campaign funds were spent with AIQ. Four different groups used the firm, even though all these campaigns were supposedly separate and could only \u201cwork together\u201d if they shared their spending limits. Vote Leave spent \u00a32,697,000. There was the \u00a3675,000 via BeLeave. A sum of \u00a3100,000 that Vote Leave donated to Veterans for Britain, which Veterans for Britain then paid to AIQ. AIQ also received \u00a332,750 from the Democratic Unionist party. Whichever way one looks at it, AIQ would seem to be fundamental to the data-driven targeting of \u201cpersuadables\u201d in the final days of the campaign.\n\nThese four campaign groups mysteriously and independently found the same tiny data analytics firm, located in a sleepy town on an island off the west coast of Canada, 5,000 miles away.\n\nIn April 2017, Dominic Cummings told me by email that Vote Leave had found the firm \u201con the internet\u201d. Darren Grimes told the Electoral Commission the same thing. The only problem? Online archives show that AIQ\u2019s website didn\u2019t show up in Google searches until after the referendum. \u201cI looked at the time,\u201d says Sanni. \u201cI was, like, \u2018Who is AIQ?\u2019 And there was nothing. No website. Nothing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Cummings who is widely acknowledged to be the mastermind of Vote Leave. A close friend of Michael Gove, he had worked as his special adviser when Gove was minister of education, alongside another senior Vote Leave director, its head of digital, Henry de Zoete.\n\nNobody is in any doubt about Cummings\u2019s brilliance: he\u2019s advertised it widely, and written thousands of words about his strategy on his blog \u2013 about how he spent 98% of his budget online; how Vote Leave\u2019s ads received nearly a billion impressions; and how, in the end, it came down to just 600,000 people, or just over 1% of registered votes. \u201cA small enough margin,\u201d he notes, that \u201ca few specific events and decisions\u201d made all the difference.\n\nHe\u2019s also been very specific about the pivotal role played by AIQ. The firm\u2019s website featured a quote from Cummings about Brexit: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done it without them.\u201d This was removed from the site this week. AIQ told the Observer that \u201cthe services it provided to Vote Leave were in accordance with instructions given by Vote Leave\u201d, and \u201cthe services provided to BeLeave were in accordance given by BeLeave\u201d.\n\nThe final weeks of the Brexit campaign were the most crucial. On his blog, Cummings says they code-named the period \u201cWaterloo\u201d and ramped up its spending, bombarding the small sliver of people it had identified as \u201cpersuadable\u201d with every kind of ad. And it worked. Cummings\u2019s campaign was a triumph. It had overcome all the odds. There\u2019s no doubt that he won the war of the internet.\n\nBut the question about this donation, the \u00a3675,000 that went to Darren Grimes (to him personally because BeLeave was not a limited company), the four campaigns that all used AIQ, and AIQ\u2019s links to Cambridge Analytica\u2026 all this has dogged the result for 18 months now.\n\nLast autumn, Cummings took himself off Twitter. A freedom of information effort by Peter Geoghegan and Adam Ramsay of Open Democracy became the basis for a judicial review by the Good Law Project\u2019s Jolyon Maugham QC, and in November, in what was front-page news, the Electoral Commission reopened its investigation into Darren Grimes and the donation. It had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d, it said, \u201cto suspect an offence may have been committed.\u201d\n\nCummings masterminded Vote Leave\u2019s strategy. And CEO Matthew Elliott signed it all off. But neither has been named by the Electoral Commission or the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office in any of the multiple subsequent investigations. As Sanni points out, \u201cIt\u2019s Darren\u2019s name all over everything. He\u2019s the one in the frame.\u201d And he\u2019s the one, according to Sanni, who has borne the brunt of the stress and anxiety that\u2019s followed.\n\nThis is the heart of the story, and it\u2019s what has ultimately prompted Shahmir Sanni to go on the record.\n\n\u201cDarren is totally loyal,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they knew that.\u201d\n\nAnd it was witnessing the toll the investigation was taking on Grimes that finally made Sanni realise the seriousness of the charges.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the impact on Darren\u2019s health that made me go: \u2018Something\u2019s fucked up. Something\u2019s wrong.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn evidence that Sanni has submitted to the Electoral Commission, he includes Facebook messages that Grimes sent him at the time senior Vote Leave staff were trying to arrange the donation; text messages that make poignant reading in the light of what happened next.\u201d\n\nGrimes: \u201cI was a bit worried about things going wrong tbh [\u2026] Especially with the prying eyes because of the expenses scandal.\u201d\n\nGrimes: \u201cManaging accounts/handling that sum of money and making sure everything is properly accounted for I guess. I have a lot to manage pretty much alone because people are flakey [sic]. And the last thing I need is to end up fucking up. Haha.\u201d\n\nSanni: \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve got anything to worry about honestlyyt [sic]. And you\u2019re worried because you care \u2013 which is good thing\u2026 And the fact that people are wiling to donate to BeLeave instead of Vote Leave is something you should be very, very proud of.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, in an email sent on 16 May to Vote Leave\u2019s lawyer, Cleo Watson wrote: \u201c\u2026 Darren and the rest of the group (all between 18 & 22) don\u2019t feel comfortable handling the money side of things, having no experience beyond their student loans.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a stunning acknowledgment, one which raises more questions. This was Vote Leave\u2019s senior director and Vote Leave\u2019s head of compliance acknowledging that this was a group of young people without the experience or wherewithal to handle such a large sum of money. Watson told the Observer: \u201cI absolutely deny the claims being levelled against me.\u201d She said she was supportive as a friend but did not have \u201cany kind of control\u201d over them.\n\nThere\u2019s a heartbreaking contrast in the documents that Sanni has \u2013 between the cynicism that informed the funding scheme and the idealism that underpinned BeLeave\u2019s messages and beliefs (\u201cBeLeave is a movement of young people working to build a bright future for Britain outside the European Union,\u201d read the funding proposal document they submitted).\n\nAnd Grimes\u2019s fear that somehow he would mess up and jeopardise the cause is unmistakable: that it was too much responsibility; that he didn\u2019t feel up to it. Sanni repeatedly tells him, \u201cyou should be proud\u201d, and Grimes replies: \u201cI guess it is just worrying soemthing [sic] is gonna fuck up and it\u2019ll be me having to pay thousands back and end up homeless.\u201d We sent Darren Grimes a summary of the evidence we had found. He said any allegations he had done anything wrong were \u201cdamaging\u201d and \u201cuntrue\u201d.\n\nWhat has amazed me through all this is Sanni. When I met him in August, I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d come forward. I thought there was an outside chance he might leak me emails or documents, but I couldn\u2019t see him going on record. He\u2019s a Leaver: these are his friends and colleagues, they are people he looked up to.\n\n\u201cEveryone associated with the campaign knew who Darren was,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody congratulated us and knew what role we\u2019d played. Michael Gove knew exactly how important we\u2019d been. He\u2019s a close friend of Dom Cummings. Of course he knew. Boris Johnson knew. Everybody knew.\u201d\n\nAnd part of me worried about what would happen if he did go on the record. I worried that Christopher Wylie\u2019s decision to come forward last week might over-influence Sanni. That he\u2019d expose himself to risks he hadn\u2019t properly thought through. That at just 24, he couldn\u2019t really understand the possible consequences. But what I\u2019ve learned about Sanni in the past few months is how tough-minded he is. Coming to terms with the idea that he had been gulled and compromised by the people he respected, for the cause that he loved, has been painful and difficult. It was a process of months. But since he decided to come forward, he\u2019s been determined to do what he has no doubt is the right thing. His messages reveal how protective and supportive he\u2019s been of Darren Grimes. They\u2019re at the heart of his decision. But he has a sense of higher purpose too.\n\n\u201cI think I respect British laws more than most British people do,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel I respect this country and love this country more than some people who have been born and bred here. Because I know and I\u2019ve seen\u2026 the safety that it\u2019s brought me and my family, my sisters and my mother as a woman, as women that have potential and are now living their best lives.\u201d\n\nSanni doesn\u2019t go into detail about what they went through in Pakistan, but at one point he tells me that he has \u201chad a lot of trauma in my life\u201d. Nobody is making him come forward. And when he talks about his mother and sisters and the freedom they now enjoy, the hairs rise on the back of my neck. And then he tells me about queueing. It starts as a riff, but then it becomes a speech. A mission statement.\n\n\u201cThis is the one country where no matter what is happening, people will stand in a line. People here, there is a core ethos of what it means to be British: to do it right. To wait your turn. To never cheat or lie your way to get to the front. It\u2019s what it means to be British.\u201d\n\nSanni would still vote Leave. He just wants to do it properly. \u201cWe don\u2019t cheat,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re British.\u201d\n\nWhat will you do on Monday, I ask him. He still works for the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, co-founded by Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave\u2019s CEO. He has no other form of income. He shrugs. \u201cGo to work, I suppose. Wait and see what happens.\u201d\n\nLike us all.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Carole Cadwalladr", "body": "The first time I met Christopher Wylie, he didn\u2019t yet have pink hair. That comes later. As does his mission to rewind time. To put the genie back in the bottle.\n\nBy the time I met him in person, I\u2019d already been talking to him on a daily basis for hours at a time. On the phone, he was clever, funny, bitchy, profound, intellectually ravenous, compelling. A master storyteller. A politicker. A data science nerd.\n\nTwo months later, when he arrived in London from Canada, he was all those things in the flesh. And yet the flesh was impossibly young. He was 27 then (he\u2019s 28 now), a fact that has always seemed glaringly at odds with what he has done. He may have played a pivotal role in the momentous political upheavals of 2016. At the very least, he played a consequential role. At 24, he came up with an idea that led to the foundation of a company called Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm that went on to claim a major role in the Leave campaign for Britain\u2019s EU membership referendum, and later became a key figure in digital operations during Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign.\n\nOr, as Wylie describes it, he was the gay Canadian vegan who somehow ended up creating \u201cSteve Bannon\u2019s psychological warfare mindfuck tool\u201d.\n\nIn 2014, Steve Bannon \u2013 then executive chairman of the \u201calt-right\u201d news network Breitbart \u2013 was Wylie\u2019s boss. And Robert Mercer, the secretive US hedge-fund billionaire and Republican donor, was Cambridge Analytica\u2019s investor. And the idea they bought into was to bring big data and social media to an established military methodology \u2013 \u201cinformation operations\u201d \u2013 then turn it on the US electorate.\n\nIt was Wylie who came up with that idea and oversaw its realisation. And it was Wylie who, last spring, became my source. In May 2017, I wrote an article headlined \u201cThe great British Brexit robbery\u201d, which set out a skein of threads that linked Brexit to Trump to Russia. Wylie was one of a handful of individuals who provided the evidence behind it. I found him, via another Cambridge Analytica ex-employee, lying low in Canada: guilty, brooding, indignant, confused. \u201cI haven\u2019t talked about this to anyone,\u201d he said at the time. And then he couldn\u2019t stop talking.\n\nBy that time, Steve Bannon had become Trump\u2019s chief strategist. Cambridge Analytica\u2019s parent company, SCL, had won contracts with the US State Department and was pitching to the Pentagon, and Wylie was genuinely freaked out. \u201cIt\u2019s insane,\u201d he told me one night. \u201cThe company has created psychological profiles of 230 million Americans. And now they want to work with the Pentagon? It\u2019s like Nixon on steroids.\u201d\n\nHe ended up showing me a tranche of documents that laid out the secret workings behind Cambridge Analytica. And in the months following publication of my article in May, it was revealed that the company had \u201creached out\u201d to WikiLeaks to help distribute Hillary Clinton\u2019s stolen emails in 2016. And then we watched as it became a subject of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into possible Russian collusion in the US election.\n\nThe Observer also received the first of three letters from Cambridge Analytica threatening to sue Guardian News and Media for defamation. We are still only just starting to understand the maelstrom of forces that came together to create the conditions for what Mueller confirmed last month was \u201cinformation warfare\u201d. But Wylie offers a unique, worm\u2019s-eye view of the events of 2016. Of how Facebook was hijacked, repurposed to become a theatre of war: how it became a launchpad for what seems to be an extraordinary attack on the US\u2019s democratic process.\n\nWylie oversaw what may have been the first critical breach. Aged 24, while studying for a PhD in fashion trend forecasting, he came up with a plan to harvest the Facebook profiles of millions of people in the US, and to use their private and personal information to create sophisticated psychological and political profiles. And then target them with political ads designed to work on their particular psychological makeup.\n\nAnd he did it on behalf of his new boss, Steve Bannon.\n\n\u201cIs it fair to say you \u2018hacked\u2019 Facebook?\u201d I ask him one night.\n\nHe hesitates. \u201cI\u2019ll point out that I assumed it was entirely legal and above board.\u201d\n\nLast month, Facebook\u2019s UK director of policy, Simon Milner, told British MPs on a select committee inquiry into fake news, chaired by Conservative MP Damian Collins, that Cambridge Analytica did not have Facebook data. The official Hansard extract reads:\n\nChristian Matheson (MP for Chester): \u201cHave you ever passed any user information over to Cambridge Analytica or any of its associated companies?\u201d\n\nMatheson: \u201cBut they do hold a large chunk of Facebook\u2019s user data, don\u2019t they?\u201d\n\nMilner: \u201cNo. They may have lots of data, but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later, on 27 February, as part of the same parliamentary inquiry, Rebecca Pow, MP for Taunton Deane, asked Cambridge Analytica\u2019s CEO, Alexander Nix: \u201cDoes any of the data come from Facebook?\u201d Nix replied: \u201cWe do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.\u201d\n\nAnd through it all, Wylie and I, plus a handful of editors and a small, international group of academics and researchers, have known that \u2013 at least in 2014 \u2013 that certainly wasn\u2019t the case, because Wylie has the paper trail. In our first phone call, he told me he had the receipts, invoices, emails, legal letters \u2013 records that showed how, between June and August 2014, the profiles of more than 50 million Facebook users had been harvested. Most damning of all, he had a letter from Facebook\u2019s own lawyers admitting that Cambridge Analytica had acquired the data illegitimately.\n\nGoing public involves an enormous amount of risk. Wylie is breaking a non-disclosure agreement and risks being sued. He is breaking the confidence of Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer.\n\nIt\u2019s taken a rollercoaster of a year to help get Wylie to a place where it\u2019s possible for him to finally come forward. A year in which Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of investigations on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 Robert Mueller\u2019s in the US, and separate inquiries by the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office in the UK, both triggered in February 2017, after the Observer\u2019s first article in this investigation.\n\nIt has been a year, too, in which Wylie has been trying his best to rewind \u2013 to undo events that he set in motion. Earlier this month, he submitted a dossier of evidence to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office and the National Crime Agency\u2019s cybercrime unit. He is now in a position to go on the record: the data nerd who came in from the cold.\n\nThere are many points where this story could begin. One is in 2012, when Wylie was 21 and working for the Liberal Democrats in the UK, then in government as junior coalition partners. His career trajectory has been, like most aspects of his life so far, extraordinary, preposterous, implausible.\n\nWylie grew up in British Columbia and as a teenager he was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. He left school at 16 without a single qualification. Yet at 17, he was working in the office of the leader of the Canadian opposition; at 18, he went to learn all things data from Obama\u2019s national director of targeting, which he then introduced to Canada for the Liberal party. At 19, he taught himself to code, and in 2010, age 20, he came to London to study law at the London School of Economics.\n\n\u201cPolitics is like the mob, though,\u201d he says. \u201cYou never really leave. I got a call from the Lib Dems. They wanted to upgrade their databases and voter targeting. So, I combined working for them with studying for my degree.\u201d\n\nPolitics is also where he feels most comfortable. He hated school, but as an intern in the Canadian parliament he discovered a world where he could talk to adults and they would listen. He was the kid who did the internet stuff and within a year he was working for the leader of the opposition.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the brightest people you will ever meet,\u201d a senior politician who\u2019s known Wylie since he was 20 told me. \u201cSometimes that\u2019s a blessing and sometimes a curse.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, at Cambridge University\u2019s Psychometrics Centre, two psychologists, Michal Kosinski and David Stillwell, were experimenting with a way of studying personality \u2013 by quantifying it.\n\nStarting in 2007, Stillwell, while a student, had devised various apps for Facebook, one of which, a personality quiz called myPersonality, had gone viral. Users were scored on \u201cbig five\u201d personality traits \u2013 Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism \u2013 and in exchange, 40% of them consented to give him access to their Facebook profiles. Suddenly, there was a way of measuring personality traits across the population and correlating scores against Facebook \u201clikes\u201d across millions of people.\n\nThe research was original, groundbreaking and had obvious possibilities. \u201cThey had a lot of approaches from the security services,\u201d a member of the centre told me. \u201cThere was one called You Are What You Like and it was demonstrated to the intelligence services. And it showed these odd patterns; that, for example, people who liked \u2018I hate Israel\u2019 on Facebook also tended to like Nike shoes and KitKats.\n\n\u201cThere are agencies that fund research on behalf of the intelligence services. And they were all over this research. That one was nicknamed Operation KitKat.\u201d\n\nThe defence and military establishment were the first to see the potential of the research. Boeing, a major US defence contractor, funded Kosinski\u2019s PhD and Darpa, the US government\u2019s secretive Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, is cited in at least two academic papers supporting Kosinski\u2019s work.\n\nBut when, in 2013, the first major paper was published, others saw this potential too, including Wylie. He had finished his degree and had started his PhD in fashion forecasting, and was thinking about the Lib Dems. It is fair to say that he didn\u2019t have a clue what he was walking into.\n\n\u201cI wanted to know why the Lib Dems sucked at winning elections when they used to run the country up to the end of the 19th century,\u201d Wylie explains. \u201cAnd I began looking at consumer and demographic data to see what united Lib Dem voters, because apart from bits of Wales and the Shetlands it\u2019s weird, disparate regions. And what I found is there were no strong correlations. There was no signal in the data.\n\n\u201cAnd then I came across a paper about how personality traits could be a precursor to political behaviour, and it suddenly made sense. Liberalism is correlated with high openness and low conscientiousness, and when you think of Lib Dems they\u2019re absent-minded professors and hippies. They\u2019re the early adopters\u2026 they\u2019re highly open to new ideas. And it just clicked all of a sudden.\u201d\n\nHere was a way for the party to identify potential new voters. The only problem was that the Lib Dems weren\u2019t interested.\n\n\u201cI did this presentation at which I told them they would lose half their 57 seats, and they were like: \u2018Why are you so pessimistic?\u2019 They actually lost all but eight of their seats, FYI.\u201d\n\nAnother Lib Dem connection introduced Wylie to a company called SCL Group, one of whose subsidiaries, SCL Elections, would go on to create Cambridge Analytica (an incorporated venture between SCL Elections and Robert Mercer, funded by the latter). For all intents and purposes, SCL/Cambridge Analytica are one and the same.\n\nAlexander Nix, then CEO of SCL Elections, made Wylie an offer he couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cHe said: \u2018We\u2019ll give you total freedom. Experiment. Come and test out all your crazy ideas.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the history of bad ideas, this turned out to be one of the worst. The job was research director across the SCL group, a private contractor that has both defence and elections operations. Its defence arm was a contractor to the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence and the US\u2019s Department of Defense, among others. Its expertise was in \u201cpsychological operations\u201d \u2013 or psyops \u2013 changing people\u2019s minds not through persuasion but through \u201cinformational dominance\u201d, a set of techniques that includes rumour, disinformation and fake news.\n\nSCL Elections had used a similar suite of tools in more than 200 elections around the world, mostly in undeveloped democracies that Wylie would come to realise were unequipped to defend themselves.\n\nWylie holds a British Tier 1 Exceptional Talent visa \u2013 a UK work visa given to just 200 people a year. He was working inside government (with the Lib Dems) as a political strategist with advanced data science skills. But no one, least of all him, could have predicted what came next. When he turned up at SCL\u2019s offices in Mayfair, he had no clue that he was walking into the middle of a nexus of defence and intelligence projects, private contractors and cutting-edge cyberweaponry.\n\n\u201cThe thing I think about all the time is, what if I\u2019d taken a job at Deloitte instead? They offered me one. I just think if I\u2019d taken literally any other job, Cambridge Analytica wouldn\u2019t exist. You have no idea how much I brood on this.\u201d\n\nA few months later, in autumn 2013, Wylie met Steve Bannon. At the time, he was editor-in-chief of Breitbart, which he had brought to Britain to support his friend Nigel Farage in his mission to take Britain out of the European Union.\n\nWhat was he like?\n\n\u201cSmart,\u201d says Wylie. \u201cInteresting. Really interested in ideas. He\u2019s the only straight man I\u2019ve ever talked to about intersectional feminist theory. He saw its relevance straightaway to the oppressions that conservative, young white men feel.\u201d\n\nWylie meeting Bannon was the moment petrol was poured on a flickering flame. Wylie lives for ideas. He speaks 19 to the dozen for hours at a time. He had a theory to prove. And at the time, this was a purely intellectual problem. Politics was like fashion, he told Bannon.\n\n\u201c[Bannon] got it immediately. He believes in the whole Andrew Breitbart doctrine that politics is downstream from culture, so to change politics you need to change culture. And fashion trends are a useful proxy for that. Trump is like a pair of Uggs, or Crocs, basically. So how do you get from people thinking \u2018Ugh. Totally ugly\u2019 to the moment when everyone is wearing them? That was the inflection point he was looking for.\u201d\n\nBut Wylie wasn\u2019t just talking about fashion. He had recently been exposed to a new discipline: \u201cinformation operations\u201d, which ranks alongside land, sea, air and space in the US military\u2019s doctrine of the \u201cfive-dimensional battle space\u201d. His brief ranged across the SCL Group \u2013 the British government has paid SCL to conduct counter-extremism operations in the Middle East, and the US Department of Defense has contracted it to work in Afghanistan.\n\nI tell him that another former employee described the firm as \u201cMI6 for hire\u201d, and I\u2019d never quite understood it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like dirty MI6 because you\u2019re not constrained. There\u2019s no having to go to a judge to apply for permission. It\u2019s normal for a \u2018market research company\u2019 to amass data on domestic populations. And if you\u2019re working in some country and there\u2019s an auxiliary benefit to a current client with aligned interests, well that\u2019s just a bonus.\u201d\n\nWhen I ask how Bannon even found SCL, Wylie tells me what sounds like a tall tale, though it\u2019s one he can back up with an email about how Mark Block, a veteran Republican strategist, happened to sit next to a cyberwarfare expert for the US air force on a plane. \u201cAnd the cyberwarfare guy is like, \u2018Oh, you should meet SCL. They do cyberwarfare for elections.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was Bannon who took this idea to the Mercers: Robert Mercer \u2013 the co-CEO of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, who used his billions to pursue a rightwing agenda, donating to Republican causes and supporting Republican candidates \u2013 and his daughter Rebekah.\n\nNix and Wylie flew to New York to meet the Mercers in Rebekah\u2019s Manhattan apartment.\n\n\u201cShe loved me. She was like, \u2018Oh we need more of your type on our side!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe gays. She loved the gays. So did Steve [Bannon]. He saw us as early adopters. He figured, if you can get the gays on board, everyone else will follow. It\u2019s why he was so into the whole Milo [Yiannopoulos] thing.\u201d\n\nRobert Mercer was a pioneer in AI and machine translation. He helped invent algorithmic trading \u2013 which replaced hedge fund managers with computer programs \u2013 and he listened to Wylie\u2019s pitch. It was for a new kind of political message-targeting based on an influential and groundbreaking 2014 paper researched at Cambridge\u2019s Psychometrics Centre, called: \u201cComputer-based personality judgments are more accurate than those made by humans\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn politics, the money man is usually the dumbest person in the room. Whereas it\u2019s the opposite way around with Mercer,\u201d says Wylie. \u201cHe said very little, but he really listened. He wanted to understand the science. And he wanted proof that it worked.\u201d\n\nAnd to do that, Wylie needed data.\n\nHow Cambridge Analytica acquired the data has been the subject of internal reviews at Cambridge University, of many news articles and much speculation and rumour.\n\nWhen Nix was interviewed by MPs last month, Damian Collins asked him:\n\n\u201cDoes any of your data come from Global Science Research company?\u201d\n\nNix: \u201cWe had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.\u201d\n\nCollins: \u201cThey have not supplied you with data or information?\u201d\n\nCollins: \u201cYour datasets are not based on information you have received from them?\u201d\n\nThe problem with Nix\u2019s response to Collins is that Wylie has a copy of an executed contract, dated 4 June 2014, which confirms that SCL, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with a company called Global Science Research (GSR), owned by Cambridge-based academic Aleksandr Kogan, specifically premised on the harvesting and processing of Facebook data, so that it could be matched to personality traits and voter rolls.\n\nHe has receipts showing that Cambridge Analytica spent $7m to amass this data, about $1m of it with GSR. He has the bank records and wire transfers. Emails reveal Wylie first negotiated with Michal Kosinski, one of the co-authors of the original myPersonality research paper, to use the myPersonality database. But when negotiations broke down, another psychologist, Aleksandr Kogan, offered a solution that many of his colleagues considered unethical. He offered to replicate Kosinski and Stilwell\u2019s research and cut them out of the deal. For Wylie it seemed a perfect solution. \u201cKosinski was asking for $500,000 for the IP but Kogan said he could replicate it and just harvest his own set of data.\u201d (Kosinski says the fee was to fund further research.)\n\nKogan then set up GSR to do the work, and proposed to Wylie they use the data to set up an interdisciplinary institute working across the social sciences. \u201cWhat happened to that idea,\u201d I ask Wylie. \u201cIt never happened. I don\u2019t know why. That\u2019s one of the things that upsets me the most.\u201d\n\nIt was Bannon\u2019s interest in culture as war that ignited Wylie\u2019s intellectual concept. But it was Robert Mercer\u2019s millions that created a firestorm. Kogan was able to throw money at the hard problem of acquiring personal data: he advertised for people who were willing to be paid to take a personality quiz on Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk and Qualtrics. At the end of which Kogan\u2019s app, called thisismydigitallife, gave him permission to access their Facebook profiles. And not just theirs, but their friends\u2019 too. On average, each \u201cseeder\u201d \u2013 the people who had taken the personality test, around 320,000 in total \u2013 unwittingly gave access to at least 160 other people\u2019s profiles, none of whom would have known or had reason to suspect.\n\nWhat the email correspondence between Cambridge Analytica employees and Kogan shows is that Kogan had collected millions of profiles in a matter of weeks. But neither Wylie nor anyone else at Cambridge Analytica had checked that it was legal. It certainly wasn\u2019t authorised. Kogan did have permission to pull Facebook data, but for academic purposes only. What\u2019s more, under British data protection laws, it\u2019s illegal for personal data to be sold to a third party without consent.\n\n\u201cFacebook could see it was happening,\u201d says Wylie. \u201cTheir security protocols were triggered because Kogan\u2019s apps were pulling this enormous amount of data, but apparently Kogan told them it was for academic use. So they were like, \u2018Fine\u2019.\u201d\n\nKogan maintains that everything he did was legal and he had a \u201cclose working relationship\u201d with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.\n\nCambridge Analytica had its data. This was the foundation of everything it did next \u2013 how it extracted psychological insights from the \u201cseeders\u201d and then built an algorithm to profile millions more.\n\nFor more than a year, the reporting around what Cambridge Analytica did or didn\u2019t do for Trump has revolved around the question of \u201cpsychographics\u201d, but Wylie points out: \u201cEverything was built on the back of that data. The models, the algorithm. Everything. Why wouldn\u2019t you use it in your biggest campaign ever?\u201d\n\nIn December 2015, the Guardian\u2019s Harry Davies published the first report about Cambridge Analytica acquiring Facebook data and using it to support Ted Cruz in his campaign to be the US Republican candidate. But it wasn\u2019t until many months later that Facebook took action. And then, all they did was write a letter. In August 2016, shortly before the US election, and two years after the breach took place, Facebook\u2019s lawyers wrote to Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, and told him the data had been illicitly obtained and that \u201cGSR was not authorised to share or sell it\u201d. They said it must be deleted immediately.\n\n\u201cI already had. But literally all I had to do was tick a box and sign it and send it back, and that was it,\u201d says Wylie. \u201cFacebook made zero effort to get the data back.\u201d\n\nThere were multiple copies of it. It had been emailed in unencrypted files.\n\nCambridge Analytica rejected all allegations the Observer put to them.\n\nDr Kogan \u2013 who later changed his name to Dr Spectre, but has subsequently changed it back to Dr Kogan \u2013 is still a faculty member at Cambridge University, a senior research associate. But what his fellow academics didn\u2019t know until Kogan revealed it in emails to the Observer (although Cambridge University says that Kogan told the head of the psychology department), is that he is also an associate professor at St Petersburg University. Further research revealed that he\u2019s received grants from the Russian government to research \u201cStress, health and psychological wellbeing in social networks\u201d. The opportunity came about on a trip to the city to visit friends and family, he said.\n\nThere are other dramatic documents in Wylie\u2019s stash, including a pitch made by Cambridge Analytica to Lukoil, Russia\u2019s second biggest oil producer. In an email dated 17 July 2014, about the US presidential primaries, Nix wrote to Wylie: \u201cWe have been asked to write a memo to Lukoil (the Russian oil and gas company) to explain to them how our services are going to apply to the petroleum business. Nix said that \u201cthey understand behavioural microtargeting in the context of elections\u201d but that they were \u201cfailing to make the connection between voters and their consumers\u201d. The work, he said, would be \u201cshared with the CEO of the business\u201d, a former Soviet oil minister and associate of Putin, Vagit Alekperov.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t make any sense to me,\u201d says Wylie. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand either the email or the pitch presentation we did. Why would a Russian oil company want to target information on American voters?\u201d\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation traces the first stages of the Russian operation to disrupt the 2016 US election back to 2014, when the Russian state made what appears to be its first concerted efforts to harness the power of America\u2019s social media platforms, including Facebook. And it was in late summer of the same year that Cambridge Analytica presented the Russian oil company with an outline of its datasets, capabilities and methodology. The presentation had little to do with \u201cconsumers\u201d. Instead, documents show it focused on election disruption techniques. The first slide illustrates how a \u201crumour campaign\u201d spread fear in the 2007 Nigerian election \u2013 in which the company worked \u2013 by spreading the idea that the \u201celection would be rigged\u201d. The final slide, branded with Lukoil\u2019s logo and that of SCL Group and SCL Elections, headlines its \u201cdeliverables\u201d: \u201cpsychographic messaging\u201d.\n\nLukoil is a private company, but its CEO, Alekperov, answers to Putin, and it\u2019s been used as a vehicle of Russian influence in Europe and elsewhere \u2013 including in the Czech Republic, where in 2016 it was revealed that an adviser to the strongly pro-Russian Czech president was being paid by the company.\n\nWhen I asked Bill Browder \u2013 an Anglo-American businessman who is leading a global campaign for a Magnitsky Act to enforce sanctions against Russian individuals \u2013 what he made of it, he said: \u201cEveryone in Russia is subordinate to Putin. One should be highly suspicious of any Russian company pitching anything outside its normal business activities.\u201d\n\nLast month, Nix told MPs on the parliamentary committee investigating fake news: \u201cWe have never worked with a Russian organisation in Russia or any other company. We do not have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that Cambridge Analytica ever did any work for Lukoil. What these documents show, though, is that in 2014 one of Russia\u2019s biggest companies was fully briefed on: Facebook, microtargeting, data, election disruption.\n\nCambridge Analytica is \u201cChris\u2019s Frankenstein\u201d, says a friend of his. \u201cHe created it. It\u2019s his data Frankenmonster. And now he\u2019s trying to put it right.\u201d\n\nOnly once has Wylie made the case of pointing out that he was 24 at the time. But he was. He thrilled to the intellectual possibilities of it. He didn\u2019t think of the consequences. And I wonder how much he\u2019s processed his own role or responsibility in it. Instead, he\u2019s determined to go on the record and undo this thing he has created.\n\nBecause the past few months have been like watching a tornado gathering force. And when Wylie turns the full force of his attention to something \u2013 his strategic brain, his attention to detail, his ability to plan 12 moves ahead \u2013 it is sometimes slightly terrifying to behold. Dealing with someone trained in information warfare has its own particular challenges, and his suite of extraordinary talents include the kind of high-level political skills that makes House of Cards look like The Great British Bake Off. And not everyone\u2019s a fan. Any number of ex-colleagues \u2013 even the ones who love him \u2013 call him \u201cMachiavellian\u201d. Another described the screaming matches he and Nix would have.\n\n\u201cWhat do your parents make of your decision to come forward?\u201d I ask him.\n\n\u201cThey get it. My dad sent me a cartoon today, which had two characters hanging off a cliff, and the first one\u2019s saying \u2018Hang in there.\u2019 And the other is like: \u2018Fuck you.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhich are you?\n\nWhat isn\u2019t in doubt is what a long, fraught journey it has been to get to this stage. And how fearless he is.\n\nAfter many months, I learn the terrible, dark backstory that throws some light on his determination, and which he discusses candidly. At six, while at school, Wylie was abused by a mentally unstable person. The school tried to cover it up, blaming his parents, and a long court battle followed. Wylie\u2019s childhood and school career never recovered. His parents \u2013 his father is a doctor and his mother is a psychiatrist \u2013 were wonderful, he says. \u201cBut they knew the trajectory of people who are put in that situation, so I think it was particularly difficult for them, because they had a deeper understanding of what that does to a person long term.\u201d\n\nHe says he grew up listening to psychologists discuss him in the third person, and, aged 14, he successfully sued the Canadian Ministry of Education and forced it to change its inclusion policies around bullying. What I observe now is how much he loves the law, lawyers, precision, order. I come to think of his pink hair as a false-flag operation. What he cannot tolerate is bullying.\n\nIs what Cambridge Analytica does akin to bullying?\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s worse than bullying,\u201d Wylie says. \u201cBecause people don\u2019t necessarily know it\u2019s being done to them. At least bullying respects the agency of people because they know. So it\u2019s worse, because if you do not respect the agency of people, anything that you\u2019re doing after that point is not conducive to a democracy. And fundamentally, information warfare is not conducive to democracy.\u201d\n\nRussia, Facebook, Trump, Mercer, Bannon, Brexit. Every one of these threads runs through Cambridge Analytica. Even in the past few weeks, it seems as if the understanding of Facebook\u2019s role has broadened and deepened. The Mueller indictments were part of that, but Paul-Olivier Dehaye \u2013 a data expert and academic based in Switzerland, who published some of the first research into Cambridge Analytica\u2019s processes \u2013 says it\u2019s become increasingly apparent that Facebook is \u201cabusive by design\u201d. If there is evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, it will be in the platform\u2019s data flows, he says. And Wylie\u2019s revelations only move it on again.\n\n\u201cFacebook has denied and denied and denied this,\u201d Dehaye says when told of the Observer\u2019s new evidence. \u201cIt has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it\u2019s failed in its duties to respect the law.It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn\u2019t. It\u2019s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.\u201d\n\nFacebook denies that the data transfer was a breach. In addition, a spokesperson said: \u201cProtecting people\u2019s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, it\u2019s a serious abuse of our rules. Both Aleksandr Kogan as well as the SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.\u201d\n\nMillions of people\u2019s personal information was stolen and used to target them in ways they wouldn\u2019t have seen, and couldn\u2019t have known about, by a mercenary outfit, Cambridge Analytica, who, Wylie says, \u201cwould work for anyone\u201d. Who would pitch to Russian oil companies. Would they subvert elections abroad on behalf of foreign governments?\n\nIt occurs to me to ask Wylie this one night.\n\n\u201cEither. I mean they\u2019re mercenaries. They\u2019ll work for pretty much anyone who pays.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an incredible revelation. It also encapsulates all of the problems of outsourcing \u2013 at a global scale, with added cyberweapons. And in the middle of it all are the public \u2013 our intimate family connections, our \u201clikes\u201d, our crumbs of personal data, all sucked into a swirling black hole that\u2019s expanding and growing and is now owned by a politically motivated billionaire.\n\nThe Facebook data is out in the wild. And for all Wylie\u2019s efforts, there\u2019s no turning the clock back.\n\nTamsin Shaw, a philosophy professor at New York University, and the author of a recent New York Review of Books article on cyberwar and the Silicon Valley economy, told me that she\u2019d pointed to the possibility of private contractors obtaining cyberweapons that had at least been in part funded by US defence.\n\nShe calls Wylie\u2019s disclosures \u201cwild\u201d and points out that \u201cthe whole Facebook project\u201d has only been allowed to become as vast and powerful as it has because of the US national security establishment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a form of very deep but soft power that\u2019s been seen as an asset for the US. Russia has been so explicit about this, paying for the ads in roubles and so on. It\u2019s making this point, isn\u2019t it? That Silicon Valley is a US national security asset that they\u2019ve turned on itself.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Carole Cadwalladr", "body": "A whistleblower who worked for the official Vote Leave campaign has broken cover to raise concerns that the masterminds behind the 2016 vote \u2013 including key figures now working for Theresa May in Downing Street \u2013 may have flouted referendum spending rules and then attempted to destroy evidence.\n\nThe allegations, from former volunteer Shahmir Sanni, are detailed in an interview in the Observer and supported by a mass of documents and files that he has passed to the Electoral Commission and the police.\n\nSanni\u2019s central claim concerns a donation of \u00a3625,000 that Vote Leave ostensibly made to an independent referendum campaign organisation called BeLeave. He claims the money, channelled to a digital services firm linked to the controversial Cambridge Analytica firm, violated election rules because it was not a genuine donation.\n\nThe money was registered by BeLeave with election authorities as a donation from Vote Leave to an independent youth operation. Sanni says BeLeave shared offices with Vote Leave \u2013 fronted by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove \u2013 which in practice offered advice and assistance to the group and helped them to decide where their cash would be spent.\n\nElectoral law prohibits co-ordination between different campaign organisations, which must all comply with spending limits. If they plan tactics or co-ordinate together, they must have a shared cap on spending. Vote Leave strongly denies any such co-ordination.\n\nSanni says that after the commission opened an investigation last March, Victoria Woodcock, the operations director for Vote Leave, deleted herself, campaign director Dominic Cummings and Vote Leave\u2019s digital director, Henry de Zoete, from dozens of files on the drive Vote Leave shared with BeLeave to hide the fact of co-ordination. On a blog post on Friday, Cummings said this was \u201cfactually wrong and libellous\u201d. Vote Leave say staff acted \u201cethically, responsibly and legally in deleting any data\u201d.\n\nMost of the \u00a3625,000 donation went to a Canadian data company called AggregateIQ, which has links to Cambridge Analytica, the firm that used harvested Facebook data to build a political targeting system in the US. Christopher Wylie, the former CA employee turned whistleblower, said that at the time of the referendum, the Canadian firm was operating \u201calmost as an internal department of Cambridge Analytica\u201d.\n\nAIQ would eventually soak up about a third of all Vote Leave\u2019s official spending, receiving \u00a32.7m from the group in addition to the money that came via BeLeave. The firm also received \u00a3100,000 from Veterans for Britain and \u00a332,750 from the DUP. After the referendum, Cummings stated on AIQ\u2019s website: \u201cWithout a doubt, the Vote Leave campaign owes a great deal of its success to the work of Aggregate IQ. We couldn\u2019t have done it without them.\u201d\n\nOther senior figures in Vote Leave included Stephen Parkinson, now Theresa May\u2019s chief adviser. Parkinson said in a statement: \u201cI am clear that I did not direct the activities of any separate campaign groups. I had no responsibility for digital campaigning or donations during the referendum and am confident that Vote Leave acted entirely within the law and strict spending rules at all times\u201d.\n\nSanni, who was treasurer and secretary of BeLeave at 22, is still a committed Eurosceptic and works for Matthew Elliott today at his TaxPayers \u2018Alliance campaign group. He says he decided to go public because he did not want Brexit to be tainted by possibly illegal activities.\n\nHe was also alarmed by the fact that his friend, Darren Grimes, the former head of the BeLeave youth group, is a focus of an Electoral Commission investigation into breaches of spending limits.\n\nSanni said Vote Leave \u201cdidn\u2019t really give us that money. They just pretended to. We had no control over it.\u201d\n\nHe believes Vote Leave\u2019s senior officials may have taken advantage of the group\u2019s youth and the political inexperience of Grimes to ramp up their own spending. He emphasises BeLeave was a small Brexit-supporting outreach group run by twenty-somethings with no real experience or background in campaigning or finance.\n\nHe says that it was helped by Vote Leave staff to set up its own constitution and bank account so that it could accept donations of its own. Vote Leave\u2019s lawyers did the legal documentation, he said.\n\n\u201cWe were advised every step of the way by Vote Leave\u2019s lawyers. They told us what to do and where to sign.\u201d\n\nThe payment to AIQ was ostensibly made by BeLeave as the referendum campaign drew to a close. But Sanni claims BeLeave didn\u2019t have any choice about where the cash would be spent, didn\u2019t sign a contract with AIQ, and did not direct what the data firm did with the funds. The money never even passed through the group\u2019s own bank account.\n\n\u201cThere was no contract in front of me, as treasurer and secretary,\u201d Sanni said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any contract.\u201d This process was repeated with a further \u00a350,000, from an outside donor.\n\nVote Leave said: \u201cIt was Darren\u2019s decision to hire AIQ, agreed with and confirmed by Shamir Sanni.\u201d\n\nVenner Shipley, Vote Leave\u2019s lawyers, said: \u201cWe have never been instructed by, nor have we ever provided advice to BeLeave.\u201d\n\nSanni has shared emails with the Observer and the authorities which appear to show the young campaigners seeking advice from top Vote Leave figures, an invoice to VoteLeave covering work on the BeLeave campaign and messages from Vote Leave lawyers and accountants about the practicalities of establishing it as an independent group.\n\nSanni explained that Vote Leave also set up and managed a shared BeLeave computer drive with the youth campaign\u2019s messaging, information and other documents.\n\nThe emails reveal other senior figures were in regular contact with BeLeave. Cleo Watson, who was head of outreach for Vote Leave and is now a political adviser alongside Parkinson in Downing street, was in touch with the organisation and was a member of a closed Facebook group for BeLeave contributors. In a statement to the Observer, Watson said: \u201cI absolutely deny the claims being levelled against me.\u201d\n\nThis weekend Parkinson was at the centre of a political storm after revealing in a statement delivered without Sanni\u2019s consent that they dated each other for a year and a half, including the period when Parkinson was at Vote Leave and Sanni worked as a volunteer.\n\nParkinson said he only gave Sanni advice and guidance in the context of that relationship. In a statement released on Friday night, lawyers for Sanni said: \u201cWe believe this is the first time a Downing Street official statement has been used to out someone. My client is now having to come out to his mother and family ... and members of his family are being forced to take urgent protective measures to ensure their safety.\u201d\n\nIn one email to Vote Leave\u2019s lawyer, Watson acknowledged that BeLeave did not have the experience needed to handle the funds that would be spent in their name, stating: \u201cDarren and the rest of the group (all between 18 & 22) don\u2019t feel comfortable handling the money side of things, having no experience beyond their student loans.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to the Observer, Watson said: \u201cTo imply that being supportive of their work was to have any kind of control over their activities is absolutely untrue.\u201d\n\nWoodcock, the operations director for Vote Leave, has been described by Cummings as \u201cthe most indispensible person in the campaign\u201d. The documents provided by Sanni suggest that after the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office last year announced an inquiry into how the different campaigns used personal data, she deleted key Vote Leave names, including her own, from dozens of files on the shared BeLeave drive.\n\nWoodcock told the Observer yesterday: \u2018The gist of those allegations is that I knowingly and deliberately deleted evidence which would be relevant to an investigation in an attempt to frustrate it. I believe that is untrue and completely unsupported by the evidence.\u201d\n\nCummings said: \u201cThe allegations about illegal donations to BeLeave are false and are part of a campaign to cancel the referendum result.\u201d\n\nFurther evidence of contact between senior figures at Vote Leave and BeLeave during the referendum came in a witness statement from Elliott, the campaign chief, which was submitted to the High Court on March 13, 2018 as part of a judicial review.\n\n\u201cI can confirm distinct campaigns were run,\u201d Elliot says, who added that he was including some examples of BeLeave publicity work to help clarify details. \u201cI thought it may assist the Court in having examples of the campaign material used by the different campaigns and I attach those.\u201d\n\nA photograph attached shows a group of young people \u2013 including Grimes \u2013 beneath the BeLeave logo. But emails detail how on March 18, 2016, it was Cleo Watson who organised that photoshoot. In another email from March 22, it was Stephen Parkinson who signed off on the logo.\n\nn February 2016, a leaked email from prominent Brexit supporter, Steve Baker, now a junior minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union, floated the idea of creating \u201cseparate legal entities each of which could spend \u00a3700,000\u201d.\n\nSanni believes this is exactly what happened with BeLeave. \u201cThroughout this whole process Darren and I were victims to very intelligent people trying to find ways to overspend.\u201d Sanni said.

Legal harassment often forms part of a broader campaign which can include physical attacks and killings,\u201d said Zbona.\n\n\u201cImpunity from the state and the declining strength of unions has a big role to play, as well as a growing competition for natural resources that is only gaining pace.\u201d\n\nAlthough attacks occurred in every region across the world, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Honduras, Guatemala and the Philippines \u2013 which collectively accounted for 212 of all incidents \u2013 were identified as the countries where attacks were most probable.\n\nLast week, the International Council on Mining and Metals acknowledged that attacks on human rights defenders were on the increase and called on relevant government authorities to take action.\n\n\u201cDefenders continue to face harassment and fear for their safety when they speak out,\u201d the council said in a statement. \u201cThis is deeply concerning for companies that are committed to human rights, openness and transparency. While we may not always agree with positions taken by human rights defenders, ICMM recognises freedom of expression and assembly as fundamental human rights.\u201d\n\nLast month, a report by Frontline Defenders said that in 2017 there was a \u201cwell resourced and coordinated strategy of defamation, criminalisation and violence deployed to intimidate, marginalise and silence human rights defenders\u201d.\n\nThe group received reports on the murder of 312 rights defenders in 27 countries.\n\n\u201cIn 2017 the alarming rise in attacks is just a continuation of what has become a very open and very aggressive attack on civil society and anyone who advocates against or challenges corporate power,\u201d said Katie Redford, director of EarthRights International, a civil society group that provides legal assistance to human and environmental rights activists.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Amana Fontanella-khan", "body": "Enough about Russia and Stormy Daniels, the leaders of the progressive movement want to talk about growing income inequality in the US.\n\n\n\nAt a live-streamed town hall event on Monday night, Senator Bernie Sanders once again circumvented cable news to host a 90-minute panel discussion on poverty, the decline of the middle class and the consolidation of corporate power.\n\nHe was joined in Washington by Senator Elizabeth Warren, director Michael Moore and economist Darrick Hamilton while roughly 1.7 million viewers tuned in to watch online, according to Sanders\u2019 office. \n\n\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian before the event, Sanders said: \u201cWe have to fight Trump every day. But we have to not lose our vision as to where we want to go as a country. We can talk about the disastrous role Russia has played in trying to undermine American democracy. That is enormously important. But we also have to talk about the fact that we have the highest rate of child poverty in any major economy of the world.\u201d\n\nThe event was streamed online by liberal video outlets \u2013 including NowThis, The Young Turks and Act.tv. The Guardian was a media partner for the event, which follows a similar town hall Sanders organized in January on universal healthcare.\n\n\n\nSanders and Moore both complained about the media\u2019s poor coverage of inequality and working people\u2019s struggles. Moore said: \u201cYou turn on the TV and it\u2019s \u2018Russia, Russia, Russia!\u2019\u201d Sanders interjected: \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget Stormy Daniels!\u201d \n\n\n\nMoore continued: \u201cThese are all shiny keys to distract us \u2026 We should know about the West Virginia strike. What an inspiration that would be. But they don\u2019t show this, Bernie, because, what would happen if they did?\u201d\n\nPanelists were not shy to point out who they felt were the culprits fuelling inequality in the United States. Its three wealthiest men \u2013 Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Warren Buffet \u2013 who collectively earn more than the poorest half of Americans, were singled out as contributing to the widening wealth gap. So too were lobbyists like the American Legislative Exchange Council and major political donors such as the Koch brothers. And, of course, representatives in Congress who are beholden to corporate donors. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhether the representatives are Democrats or Republicans, they go for the money. How do you fight that?\u201d asked Moore. Speaking of Democratic donors, Moore tickled the audience with a story about a red carpet run-in with a Goldman Sachs executive at the Oscars. \u201cThe CEO of Goldman Sachs said \u2018Why are you attacking us? We are Democrats\u2019.\u201d That, Moore suggested, was part of the problem.\n\n\u201cWe need a party that\u2019s going to be there for the people, the working people \u2026 We need to challenge people on our own side of the fence to stand up and do their job for the working people of this country,\u201d Moore said.\n\nSpeaking about the need to inspire voters, he added: \u201cThe biggest party is the non-voters\u2019 party.\u201d He rejected the notion that non-voters were apathetic, saying that skipping the polls was an \u201can act of civil disobedience\u201d. He added: \u201cThey aren\u2019t going to vote, unless you give them a reason to vote.\u201d\n\nThe panelists were keen to highlight solutions to rising inequality, and almost all agreed on the importance of strong unions.\n\n\u201cUnions built America\u2019s middle class. It will take unions to rebuild America\u2019s middle class,\u201d said Warren, to thunderous applause.\n\n\n\nThe need for progressive taxation was also stressed. Speaking about lobbying efforts behind the recent tax cuts, she added: \u201cWe have to call it out for what it is: corruption. This is an organized effort to take over our government, and make the government work better and better for a thinner and thinner slice of America.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian, Sanders also warned about the growing concentration of corporate power. \u201cWhen you have companies like Amazon that have extraordinary power, when you have companies like Facebook that to a significant degree control discourse, am I concerned about monopoly power? Absolutely. We need to have the kind of discussion that Congress has not had yet.\u201d\n\nWhile Sanders doesn\u2019t agree with President Trump\u2019s tariffs, he said that they are a \u201cweapon you can use\u201d to address competitors from low-wage countries. \u201cAmerican workers are put in an extreme disadvantage in that kind of competition,\u201d Sanders said, adding: \u201cWe have to go broader [than Trump\u2019s tariffs]. I have called for the ending of permanent normal trade relations with China and Nafta. I think trade is a positive thing, but it has to be done in a way that is fair.\u201d\n\nTrump was barely mentioned during the event, but there was one rapturous moment when his name came up. Moore, quoting a Democratic candidate running in Michigan, said: \u201cIn this election you are not electing a member to the House of Representatives, you are electing a jury for the impeachment of Donald J Trump. Never forget that over these next few months.\u201d\n\nBut Moore was quick to bring the audience back to the challenge at hand. \u201cWith that in mind, I want to make this clear ... If we just get rid of Trump, and return to what it was like the day before Trump, how were things then? With healthcare? With poverty? We have to move forward. And we have to provide the leadership and vision to make that happen.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Martin Belam", "body": "Reporters have photographed what appears to be evidence of people voting twice in Russia\u2019s presidential election. Vladimir Putin returned to power at the weekend with a 76.7% share of the vote.\n\nIn the town of Ust-Djeguta, in southern Russia near Georgia, Reuters reporters photographed 17 people who appeared to cast two ballots. Leila Koichuyeva, a member of the election commission, when shown the pictures of people who apparently voted twice, said: \u201cThey could be twins.\u201d\n\nZukhra Chomaeva, another election official at polling station number 217, said: \u201cHow do I know if they\u2019re the same person? They might look the same.\u201d\n\nLudmila Sklyarevskaya was among those photographed apparently voting twice, once at polling station 215 and once at polling station 216 in the town. She denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\n\nMany of the people photographed appeared to be state employees: Sklyarevskaya was identified by a colleague as a hospital deputy director of health and safety.\n\nSklyarevskaya arrived to vote with a group of eight other women and one man through the gates of polling station 216. About 20 minutes later, the same group were observed voting again a few hundred metres away at polling station 215.\n\nApproached about the incident, Sklyarevskaya said she had voted only once, at a third polling station, number 217. \u201cWho directed you to do this investigation?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou do not have the right to get involved in the electoral system.\u201d\n\nOfficial results released on Monday showed the three polling stations in Ust-Djeguta had an average turnout of 81.5% and delivered a majority for Putin of 89.86%. National turnout was 67%, according to the central election commission.\n\nAt polling station number 216, a count revealed there were not enough ballot papers to tally with the figure for Putin votes \u2013 1,299 \u2013 that officials had provisionally pencilled in. When a recount produced the same outcome, the election officials said they were going home.\n\nWhen Reuters reporters asked how the officials could go home at that point, the director of the school hosting the polling station said: \u201cYou want to cast doubt on Putin\u2019s victory?\u201d\n\nA Kremlin spokesman responding to the allegations said: \u201cIf these reports from the respected Reuters agency are backed up by corresponding statements to law enforcement agencies from the observers who were at each polling station, then it\u2019s a worry. If they are not backed up, then it does not worry us at all.\u201d \n\n\n\nReuters reporters also used mechanical counters to count everybody who cast a ballot at 12 polling stations. In some places, the discrepancies between the official count and the Reuters tally were small, but in nine of the 12 polling stations the discrepancies were 10% or greater. \n\n\n\nIn the 2016 Russian parliamentary elections, Reuters carried out a similar exercise. On that occasion, among turnout discrepancies, a Reuters reporter who had cast a ballot for a party other than Putin\u2019s United Russia found that no vote for that party had been recorded at that polling station.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Paul Lewis", "body": "It was the summer of 2007. Brittany Kaiser was not yet 21, but she was one of a handful of full-time workers in the small digital team for Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign, uploading photos of the Illinois senator to something called a Facebook page.\n\nAt the next desk was another activist who knew a bit about the social media startup. Chris Hughes, 24, had worked with his Harvard roommate Mark Zuckerberg to create Facebook as a tool for students a few years earlier.\n\nA decade later, the picture has darkened, as Hughes recently lamented when he complained about the \u201cnegative role\u201d Facebook is playing in politics.\n\nAnd Kaiser, who until two weeks ago was a senior employee at Cambridge Analytica, has worked for a company involved in two of the most negative and controversial campaigns in history.\n\nNow she wants to make those secrets public, becoming the second former Cambridge Analytica employee to come forward in less than a week.\n\nHer motive for doing so is likely to come under scrutiny: this has been a catastrophic week for the firm \u2013 and Kaiser was a senior executive. She claims, however, that it is because she wants to stop telling lies.\n\nIt seems remarkable that an Obama volunteer who studied human rights and voted for Bernie Sanders ended up working for a controversial data analytics company at the centre of a global story about the use of data and dirty tricks.\n\nThe company\u2019s work on Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign left her feeling \u201cincredibly internally conflicted\u201d, but she insists she was only doing her job; her political views have nothing to do with her decision to reveal secrets about Cambridge Analytica.\n\nAsked why she has decided to speak out, Kaiser flares: \u201cWhy should we make excuses for these people? Why? I\u2019m so tired of making excuses for old white men. Fucking hell.\u201d\n\nShe says she believes that Silicon Valley has much to answer for. \u201cThere\u2019s a much wider story that I think needs to be told about how people can protect themselves, and their own data.\u201d\n\nHer disclosures come almost a week after the Observer revealed new information on how data was acquired from more than 50 million Facebook friends without their consent.\n\nKaiser has less to say on the harvesting of this data in 2014 than she does on other issues, which is corroborated by emails, correspondence and other documents reviewed by the Guardian.\n\nHer own journey \u2013 from Obama\u2019s campaign to trying to secure business with political parties and corporate interests in Ethiopia, Lithuania, Romania, Nigeria and Zambia; and from Occupy to Trump\u2019s presidential victory party \u2013 says much about the bizarre state of politics in the digital era.\n\nFacebook was not all Kaiser and Hughes had in common when they met at Obama\u2019s Chicago HQ; they had attended the same prestigious private school in Massachusetts. Now they were among fewer than a dozen Obama activists and volunteers on the \u201cnew media\u201d team.\n\nHughes, though, stood apart. He was apparently still able to pull strings at Facebook, which had relocated to California. When the campaign noticed problematic things about the social media site, such as the deluge of racist and abusive material being posted on the senator\u2019s \u201cwall\u201d, Hughes, it seems, could find a solution.\n\nOn that occasion, Kaiser says, the platform was changed so that campaign workers could pre-approve messages before they appeared.\n\nAnother leap forward for Obama 2008\u2019s Facebook experiment was their response to the avalanche of \u201cfriend\u201d requests tying up campaign resources, with volunteers having to check photos. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want a media controversy around Barack Obama being friends with somebody that was naked with an assault rifle,\u201d she says.\n\nThe solution was a change that meant fans could \u201cfollow\u201d Obama\u2019s campaign rather than request a \u201cfriend connection\u201d.\n\nFor the next few years, Kaiser says, her career diverged from US politics: she was a marketing officer for London\u2019s air ambulance, volunteered for human rights groups, lived in Asia and started an inward-investment company in Libya \u2013 primarily, she claims, to gain access to the country for human rights work.\n\nThese opaque foreign adventures appear to have caught the eye of the SCL Group, a British psy-ops company, and its ambitious chief executive, Alexander Nix. Kaiser said she first met Nix at a sushi restaurant with some Mongolian clients. He drilled her as a spy might a source, apparently telling her: \u201cLet me get you drunk and steal your secrets\u201d.\n\nThat was 2012, the year Obama was re-elected, this time on a much more sophisticated campaign whose backbone was \u201cbig data\u201d and Facebook friend networks, using techniques that foreshadowed much of what was to come.\n\nKaiser recalls Nix getting excited when she told him she\u2019d worked for Obama.\n\nKaiser worked for SCL until Cambridge Analytica was formally incorporated.\n\nNix, she says, saw the gap in the market. The Republicans were losing the data race; that was where the opportunities were.\n\nThe kind of personality questionnaires conducted by the Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan on Facebook were particularly important, she adds, as they allowed the company\u2019s data scientists to build models connecting data to behavioral traits and build \u201ca very in-depth picture on those individuals\u201d.\n\nKogan paid around 270,000 people to take his personality test. But, Kaiser says, Cambridge Analytica did many similar quizzes \u2013 not always on Facebook \u2013 and had personality data for more than 2 million Americans.\n\n\u201cThe bigger a data set that you have, the more polls, the more surveys that you have that people undertake, the more accurate your models are going to be,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s just a fact of data science.\u201d\n\nAround mid-2015, Kaiser says, the company knew Facebook was changing its API rules to restrict the data that could be harvested through questionnaires like those of Kogan.\n\nThis appears to have prompted a last-minute grab for data. In one internal email seen by the Guardian, employees are asked to identify which issues on a list of 500 Facebook \u201clike\u201d items would be most \u201cuseful for political modeling or commercial sales\u201d.\n\nIt is unclear from the email where the data was coming from, but the list is curiously revealing. Cambridge Analytica didn\u2019t want to know who \u201cliked\u201d Eminem, Family Guy, YouTube, The Walking Dead or Mountain Dew. It was, however, interested in Facebook users who \u201cliked\u201d Mitt Romney, Walt Disney World, the US Marine Corps and Coca-Cola.\n\nNigeria was one of Kaiser\u2019s first assignments. Three days ago, in one of a series of extraordinary scoops, the Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr revealed details about this project, aimed at securing the re-election of the then president, Goodluck Jonathan. He was unaware of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s involvement.\n\nCadwalladr revealed details of a murky operation by suspected Israeli hackers to discredit Johnson\u2019s rival, Muhammadu Buhari, by finding \u201ckompromat\u201d on the Nigerian politician. Asked about this, Kaiser confirms she knew the Israeli contractors.\n\n\u201cThey were working for the same client that we were working for.\u201d Who was that? \u201cOil billionaires,\u201d she replies.\n\nKaiser\u2019s story of how the Israelis got their information, however, was worse than computer hacking.\n\n\u201cThey went to Nigeria, became friends with the people in Buhari\u2019s campaign, and started sitting in meetings in the campaign headquarters,\u201d she says. \u201cThey got information by being in there, however you do that. Making friends with people, sitting in high-level meetings, working on their computers.\u201d\n\nThis, she claims, was being done independently of Cambridge Analytica.\n\nEarlier this week there was another scoop, based on undercover footage from C4 News which captured Nix boasting about using \u201choney traps\u201d, fake news campaigns and operations with ex-spies to swing election campaigns around the world. \n\n\n\nKaiser claims she had never heard him make such claims before. \u201cAlexander is known to oversell everything to close the deal.\u201d\n\nBy 2015, Nix and Kaiser were pitching to increase their market share in the most lucrative market of all: the US presidential campaign.\n\nCambridge Analytica had already worked for several 2014 mid-term candidates, Super Pacs and foundations. Consultants usually limit themselves to one presidential campaign, but Cambridge Analytica ended up working for two Republican primary candidates: Ted Cruz and Ben Carson.\n\nPrior to that, Kaiser says, the company also made unsuccessful bids for business with Carly Fiorina, Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and Chris Christie.\n\nThat same year, a former Florida governor with a famous name who many suspected would secure the nomination also visited Cambridge Analytica\u2019s London office. Kaiser says she never met Jeb Bush, but that according to Nix, the Republican political scion wanted the firm to join his future campaign for the White House.\n\nShe claims Nix always saw political campaigning as a springboard to a bigger mission.\n\n\u201cTo become a famous advertising company in the US market; that\u2019s what he planned from the beginning,\u201d she says. \u201cAlexander Nix has no interest in the Republicans or Democrats winning or losing.\u201d\n\nThat does not seem to tally with the ideological zeal driving Cambridge Analytica\u2019s patrons, the Republican billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, who later bankrolled Trump\u2019s campaign. They worked closely with Steve Bannon, whose town house on Capitol Hill \u2013 an office for Breitbart, and a nerve-centre for his political operations \u2013 has become something of a legend in Washington.\n\n\u201cYes, \u2018The Embassy\u2019,\u201d Kaiser recalls, adding: \u201cI used to actually share a key with Alexander to that house.\u201d\n\nIt was not until mid-2016 that Cambridge Analytica finally got the biggest ticket in Beltway politics: a contract with the presidential campaign.\n\nIt immediately sent a team of data scientists and political strategists to San Antonio, Texas, where the digital campaign was being run. Others went to the headquarters in Trump Towers, New York.\n\nQuestions have been asked about the legality of a London-based company, with a largely British staff, working on the campaign. Kaiser cannot answer them definitively.\n\nWhat she does know is where Nix was on the night Trump was elected, because she was there too: at the Republican\u2019s victory party in New York, standing next to the Mercers.\n\nIn her pocket, Kaiser says, she also had a ticket to Hillary Clinton\u2019s election night party. But when the TV screens \u201cstarted going red state, red state, red state\u201d before declaring Trump the victor, she knew she didn\u2019t need it.\n\nKaiser says she turned to the Mercers, who were not watching the screen, and relayed the news. \u201cYou could just see them looking at each other, like: \u2018Holy shit \u2026 we just became the most powerful people in politics\u2019.\u201d According to her account, Nix told her: \u201cWe did it.\u201d\n\nKaiser says she felt conflicted about Trump\u2019s victory, and still does.\n\nHer testimony, relayed to the Guardian in recent days in a variety of Silicon Valley locations, raises many questions \u2013 about what she says now, and what she did for the company.\n\nIt will not be easy for Kaiser to put her past behind her.\n\n\u201cCorporations like Google, Facebook, Amazon, all of these large companies, are making tens or hundreds of billions of dollars off of monetizing people\u2019s data,\u201d Kaiser says. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling companies and governments for years that data is probably your most valuable asset. Individuals should be able to monetize their own data \u2013 that\u2019s their own human value \u2013 not to be exploited.\u201d\n\nAsked if she has any regrets, Kaiser says she does.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I regret not spending all those years only working for causes I believed in, and instead just learning about how to achieve an end \u2013 how to get a result. I really know how to get a result now \u2013 and I can do it for anybody.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Guardian Staff", "body": "Donald Trump will announce death penalties for drug dealers on Monday.\n\nA top administration official said on Sunday the president\u2019s plan to combat opioid drug addiction nationwide, to be announced in New Hampshire on Monday, calls for the death penalty for drug traffickers where appropriate under current law.\n\nNew Hampshire has been hit hard by the opioid crisis, a fact Trump acknowledged last August when he said: \u201cWe have the drug lords in Mexico that are knocking the hell out of our country.

Last week, retiring senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a persistent Trump critic, told New Hampshire Republicans that someone needs to stop Trump \u2013 and it could be him if no one else steps up.\n\nIn recent weeks the president, who aims to be seen as tough on crime, has been highlighting his preference for the \u201cultimate penalty\u201d for drug dealers.\n\n\n\nThe president told the audience at a Pennsylvania rally this month that countries like Singapore have fewer issues with drug addiction because they harshly punish dealers. He argued that a person in the US can get the death penalty or life in prison for shooting one person, but that a drug dealer who potentially kills thousands can spend little or no time in jail.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe made similar comments at a White House summit on opioids: \u201cSome countries have a very, very tough penalty \u2013 the ultimate penalty. And, by the way, they have much less of a drug problem than we do. So we\u2019re going to have to be very strong on penalties.\u201d\n\nTrump also wants Congress to pass legislation reducing the amount of drugs needed to trigger mandatory minimum sentences for traffickers who knowingly distribute certain opioids, said Andrew Bremberg, Trump\u2019s domestic policy director, who briefed reporters on the plan Trump is scheduled to unveil.\n\nThe president will be joined by first lady Melania Trump, who has shown an interest in the issue, particularly as it pertains to her focus on child welfare.\n\nDeath for drug traffickers and mandatory minimum penalties for distributing certain opioids are two elements under the part of Trump\u2019s plan that deals with law enforcement and interdiction to break the international and domestic flow of drugs into and across the US. Other parts of the plan include broadening education and awareness and expanding access to proven treatment and recovery efforts.\n\nThe justice department said the federal death penalty is available for limited drug-related offenses, including violations of the \u201cdrug kingpin\u201d provisions of federal law.\n\n\n\nDoug Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University, said it was not clear death sentences for drug dealers, even for those whose product causes multiple deaths, would be constitutional. Berman said the issue would be litigated extensively and would have to be definitively decided by the US supreme court.\n\nOpioids, including prescription opioids, heroin and synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, killed more than 42,000 people in the US in 2016, more than any year on record, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A formal request has also been sent to the office of the attorney general, Christian Porter, asking him to consider consenting to the prosecution proceeding.\n\nA statement from the legal team said there were \u201cwidespread and credible eyewitness reports \u2026 of extensive and systematic crimes against the Muslim Rohingyan population by the Myanmar security forces, including extra-judicial killings, disappearances, violence, rape, unlawful detention, and destruction of property and whole villages. Ms Suu Kyi has denied these events have occurred.\n\n\u201cIt is alleged that Ms Suu Kyi has failed to use her position of authority and power, and, as such, has permitted the Myanmar security forces to deport and forcibly remove Rohingya from their homes.\u201d\n\nSuu Kyi \u2013 the 1991 Nobel peace laureate whose public image has been tarnished by her unwillingness to publicly condemn military atrocities against the Rohingya \u2013 is visiting Australia as part of the Asean Australia special summit, hosted by the federal government in Sydney.\n\nShe has spoken little about the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar\u2019s western Rakhine state \u2013 and pointedly refused to use the word Rohingya. In a speech last September she said the latest violence in Rakhine was sparked by attacks on military outposts.\n\n\u201cIt is not the intention of the Myanmar government to apportion blame or to abnegate responsibility. We condemn all human rights violations and unlawful violence.\u201d\n\nAustralia formally recognises the principle of universal jurisdiction, giving Australian courts jurisdiction to hear allegations of the most serious criminal offences under international law, such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, regardless of the nationality of the alleged offender, or the place of the commission of the offences.\n\nThere is an international precedent. The former Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet, was arrested in London under universal jurisdiction. He was placed under house arrest but did not face trial.\n\nBut there are diplomatic considerations with the prosecution of foreign leaders. A spokesman for the attorney general told the Guardian: \u201cWe haven\u2019t been notified of any such action and if we were, wouldn\u2019t comment on a matter that is before a court.\u201d\n\nBut it appears unlikely that the government that invited Suu Kyi to the country would then consent to her prosecution.\n\nThere would also, almost certainly, be dispute over whether Suu Kyi, by virtue of her position as state counsellor, enjoys immunity from prosecution.\n\nSuu Kyi is the not the head of state of Myanmar \u2013 that position is held by president Htin Kyaw \u2013 but Suu Kyi is the de facto, if not de jure, leader of the government.

In other words, one of Marathon\u2019s gas station workers would have to toil more than nine centuries to make as much as Heminger grabbed in just one year.\n\nEmployees of at least five other US firms would have to work even longer \u2013 more than a millennium \u2013 to catch up with their top bosses. These companies include the auto parts maker Aptiv (CEO-worker pay ratio: 2,526 to 1), the temp agency Manpower (2,483 to 1), amusement park owner Six Flags (1,920 to 1), Del Monte Produce (1,465 to 1), and apparel maker VF (1,353 to 1).\n\nThese revelations come thanks to a new federal regulation that requires publicly traded US corporations to disclose, for the first time ever, how much their chief executives are making compared to their median workers. The disclosures are just now starting to flow in.\n\nUp until this year, comparisons of CEO and worker pay have had to rely on the average take-homes of US workers overall \u2013 not the pay of workers at individual corporations. Those generalized figures helped us track the soaring trajectory of executive compensation at big US corporations, from 30 times average worker pay in the 1960s to over 300 times more recently.\n\nBut headlines around those average figures did next to nothing to slow our CEO pay-hike express. Will the release of the ratios at individual corporations make any more of a difference?\n\nCorporate America must surely think so. Ever since 2010, the year Congress plugged a ratio disclosure mandate into the Dodd-Frank financial reform act, corporate lobbyists have been scheming to delay and repeal that mandate\u2019s implementation. But responsible investors and other activists rallied and kept the mandate in place.\n\nThe new ratios offer a benchmark for corporate greed that exposes exactly which firms are sharing the wealth their employees create and which aren\u2019t, knowledge we can use to impose consequences on the corporations doing the most to make the United States more unequal.\n\nIn Oregon, the city of Portland has adopted what the economist Branko Milanovi\u0107 has labeled \u201cthe first tax that targets inequality as such\u201d. Portland\u2019s new levy imposes a 10% business tax surcharge on companies with top execs making over 100 times their median worker pay \u2014 and a 20% surcharge on firms with pay gaps that stretch past 250 times.\n\nCity officials in San Francisco are bringing a similar measure before voters this November. At the state level, lawmakers in Minnesota, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Illinois, and Massachusetts are getting into the pay-ratio tax act as well.\n\nIn California, a state Senate bill that took the same approach nearly passed. The key sponsor of that measure, Mark DeSaulnier, now sits in Congress, where he\u2019s co-sponsoring a like-minded federal bill.\n\nOther lawmakers are advancing proposals to link government procurement to pay ratios. Existing public policies deny government contracts to companies with employment practices that contribute to race and gender inequality. Why should tax dollars be subsidizing firms that increase economic inequality?\n\nIn Rhode Island, a pending Senate bill would give preferential treatment in state contracting to corporations that pay their CEOs no more than 25 times their median worker pay. Several congressional offices are now preparing legislation that aims in the same direction.\n\nEven some Republicans have shown interest in leveraging the power of the public purse against firms that pay top execs astronomically more than workers. In 2015, then Republican congressman (now the White House budget director) Mick Mulvaney tried to prevent the US Export-Import Bank from subsidizing any company with CEO pay over 100 times median worker pay. Lawmakers could easily apply the same standard to other forms of corporate welfare.\n\nRatio disclosure also opens doors for trade unions to bring demands tied to pay gaps into collective bargaining. Consumers can shun corporations that lavish pay on their top execs at the expense of their employees. Investors can put their 401(k) dollars in mutual funds that screen out corporations with chronic pay-gap excess.\n\nAll this activity could make a significant dent in inequality. Corporate execs today head up about two-thirds of America\u2019s top 1% households.\n\nWe don\u2019t have to just complain anymore about runaway executive pay. Now we can make corporations that pay their CEOs unconscionably more than their workers change their ways \u2013 or pay the consequences.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Charles Kaiser", "body": "Michael Isikoff and David Corn lay bare the evidence that Trump and Putin have been striving to collaborate for years\n\nWhenever I finish a book like Russian Roulette, I ask myself the same question: why is anyone still debating whether there was collusion between the Russians and Donald Trump?\n\nLike Collusion, a comprehensive volume by the Guardian\u2019s Luke Harding, this narrative by investigative reporters Michael Isikoff and David Corn leaves the reader nearly overwhelmed by evidence that Trump and Vladimir Putin have been striving to collaborate for years.\n\nIt was 2013 when Trump first tweeted that he wanted to be Putin\u2019s \u201cbest friend\u201d. Later he told Fox Putin looked \u201clike a great leader\u201d. Putin\u2019s constant goals have been to destroy Nato and the EU. Trump was a big advocate of Brexit, which was a body blow to the EU, and in the 2016 campaign he called Nato \u201cobsolete\u201d. Trump began visiting Moscow in 1987 and his on again, off again effort to build a Trump Tower there continued for three decades \u2013 right through the presidential election.\n\nIn 2006, Trump became executive producer of a Russian version of The Apprentice. Years later he dismissed the massive evidence that Putin routinely orders the murder of journalists and other dissidents, telling MSNBC: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen that. I don\u2019t know that he has. Have you been able to prove that?\u201d\n\nThen of course there\u2019s the Palm Beach estate he bought for $45m in 2004. After the housing bubble burst, he sold that house for $95m \u2013 to a Russian oligarch, Dmitry Rybolovlev.\n\nNearly all the other stations of the twisted Trump-Russian cross are covered here, including the famous Trump Tower meeting between Russian emissaries and Donald Trump Jr, Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner. Although the Russians failed at that moment to produce promised dirt on Hillary Clinton, the authors point out that \u201cTrump\u2019s senior advisers now had new reason to believe that Putin\u2019s regime wanted Trump to win and was willing to act clandestinely to boost his chances. The campaign did not report this private Russian outreach to the FBI.\u201d\n\nRussian government officials, Corn and Isikoff write, could well have \u201cinterpreted that as a signal that Trump would not mind or protest if Moscow took other actions to benefit the Republican candidate. The Russians had offered to help, and Trump\u2019s campaign had demonstrated a willingness to take what Moscow had to offer.\u201d\n\nAlmost any of these details would have been enough to torpedo any other presidential campaign, but Trump somehow managed to weather every single crisis. A big reason for that was the astonishingly poor news judgment of the mainstream media, including, in particular, the New York Times.\n\nA Harvard study of mainstream election coverage revealed that there were \u201croughly four times as many Clinton-related sentences that described scandals as opposed to policies \u2013 whereas Trump-related sentences were one-and-a-half times as likely to be about policy as scandal\u201d. There were also more than 60,000 sentences published about Clinton and her emails \u2013 and less than 10,000 about Trump\u2019s connections to Russia.\n\nBarack Obama\u2019s dithering in the face of Russian intrusions also contributed to the disastrous outcome. An Obama official told Corn and Isikoff it wasn\u2019t until two months after the election that \u201call the pieces came together for us\u201d. When they did, Vice-President Joe Biden had a \u201cvisceral reaction: \u2018If this is true, it\u2019s treason.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe only Democrat who acted appropriately during the campaign was the Senate minority leader, Harry Reid, who directly attacked the FBI director, James Comey, for his double standard.\n\n\u201cAs soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to Secretary Clinton, you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible,\u201d he wrote, adding that \u201cit has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisers, and the Russian government. The public has a right to know this information.\u201d\n\nMuch has been written elsewhere about what may well have been the single worst story published in the final days before the election. Immediately after Slate had published a brilliant and nuanced piece by Franklin Foer about unexplained communications between a Trump business server and Alfa Bank in Moscow, the Times\u2019s executive editor, Dean Baquet, approved an article with this headline: \u201cInvestigating Donald Trump, FBI Sees No Clear Link to Russia.\u201d\n\nAmong its many other failings, that headline contradicted the story\u2019s most important finding: US intelligence agencies \u201chad been compelled by \u2018apparent connections between some of Mr Trump\u2019s aides and Moscow\u2019 to \u2018open a broad investigation into possible links between the Russian government and Republican presidential candidate\u2019\u201d.\n\nAs Corn and Isikoff explain, the editors decided to make the FBI\u2019s failure to prove a connection the article\u2019s theme, instead of the much more important fact of the investigation itself.\n\nWhat is new in Russian Roulette about the Times piece is how the ex-British spy Christopher Steele reacted to it. Steele was the author of the dossier which contained details of extensive contacts between Trump aides and the Russians in 2016, as well as the notorious story about Trump\u2019s alleged activities at Moscow\u2019s Ritz-Carlton hotel.\n\nBefore the Times piece appeared, Steele had been considering a trip to Washington to discuss his findings with members of Congress \u2013 and perhaps hold a press conference on the steps of the Capitol. Once he saw that the Times was pooh-poohing the whole subject, Steele cancelled his trip.\n\nIf Steele had gone public, could that have been enough to change the election? That is one of the many tantalizing what-ifs in this compelling account.\n\nHarding\u2019s book is more thorough about several important aspects of this history, including the extremely strange role of Deutsche Bank, which extended hundreds of millions of dollars of loans to Trump at the same time its Moscow branch was laundering millions of dollars for Russian oligarchs.\n\nBut Russian Roulette still makes many important contributions to this extraordinary story \u2013 a saga which I believe is destined to bring an abrupt end to the Trump presidency.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Emma Graham-harrison", "body": "Senior executives from the firm at the heart of Facebook\u2019s data breach boasted of playing a key role in bringing Donald Trump to power and said they used \u201cunattributable and untrackable\u201d advertising to support their clients in elections, according to an undercover expose.\n\nIn secretly recorded conversations, Cambridge Analytica\u2019s CEO, Alexander Nix, claimed he had met Trump \u201cmany times\u201d, while another senior member of staff said the firm was behind the \u201cdefeat crooked Hillary\u201d advertising campaign.\n\n\u201cWe just put information into the bloodstream of the internet and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again over time to watch it take shape,\u201d said the executive. \u201cAnd so this stuff infiltrates the online community, but with no branding, so it\u2019s unattributable, untrackable.\u201d\n\nCaught on camera by an undercover team from Channel 4 News, Nix was also dismissive of Democrats on the House intelligence committee, who had questioned him over Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign.\n\nSenior managers then appeared to suggest that in their work for US clients, there was planned division of work between official campaigns and unaffiliated \u201cpolitical action groups\u201d.\n\nThat could be considered coordination \u2013 which is not allowed under US election law.

We ran all the digital campaign, the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy,\u201d he told reporters who were posing as potential clients from Sri Lanka.\n\nThe company\u2019s head of data, Alex Tayler, added: \u201cWhen you think about the fact that Donald Trump lost the popular vote by 3m votes but won the electoral college vote that\u2019s down to the data and the research.\n\n\u201cYou did your rallies in the right locations, you moved more people out in those key swing states on election day. That\u2019s how he won the election.\u201d\n\nAnother executive, Mark Turnbull, managing director of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s political division, was recorded saying: \u201cHe won by 40,000 votes in three states. The margins were tiny.\u201d\n\nTurnbull took credit for one of the most well known and controversial campaigns of the last presidential campaign, organised by the political action group Make America Number 1.\n\n\u201cThe brand was \u2018Defeat Crooked Hillary\u2019. You\u2019ll remember this of course?\u201d he told the undercover reporter. \u201cThe zeros, the OO of crooked were a pair of handcuffs ... We made hundreds of different kinds of creative, and we put it online.\u201d\n\nTurnbull said the company sometimes used \u201cproxy organisations\u201d, including charities and activist groups, to help disseminate the messages \u2013 and keep the company\u2019s involvement in the background.\n\nWhen the undercover reporter expressed worries that American authorities might seize on details of a dirty campaign, Nix said the US had no jurisdiction over Cambridge Analytica, even though the company is American and is registered in Delaware.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely convinced that they have no jurisdiction,\u201d he told the purported client. \u201cSo if US authorities came asking for information, they would simply refuse to collaborate. \u201cWe\u2019ll say: none of your business.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Channel 4 News before seeing the undercover film, Hillary Clinton said: \u201cThere was a new kind of campaign that was being run on the other side, that nobody had ever faced before. Because it wasn\u2019t just all about me. It was about how to suppress voters who were inclined to vote for me \u2026 when you have a massive propaganda effort to prevent people from thinking straight, because they\u2019re being flooded with false information.\u201d\n\nIn the report, Nix also implied that it was possible to mislead authorities by omission, discussing his appearance in front of the House intelligence committee, for its inquiry into possible Russian election meddling.\n\n\n\nThe Republicans only asked three questions, which took five minutes, he told the reporter. And while the Democrats spent two hours questioning him, he claimed they were so far out of their depths that he didn\u2019t mind responding.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have no secrets. They\u2019re politicians, they\u2019re not technical. They don\u2019t understand how it works,\u201d he said, when asked about whether he was forced to testify.\n\n\n\nHe went on to describe how political candidates are manipulated.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t understand because the candidate never, is never involved. He\u2019s told what to do by the campaign team.\u201d The reporter asks if that means the candidate is just a puppet, and Nix replies simply: \u201cAlways.\u201d\n\nIn another exchange, Tayler describes an apparently planned division of spending on the campaign trail, with the candidate organising \u201cpositive\u201d messages, with negative attack ads left to the super Pacs, which may engage in unlimited political spending independently of the campaigns.\n\n\u201cAs part of it, sometimes you have to separate it from the political campaign itself ... campaigns are normally subject to limits about how much money they can raise. Whereas outside groups can raise an unlimited amount.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the campaign will use their finite resources for things like persuasion and mobilisation and then they leave the \u2018air war\u2019 they call it, like the negative attack ads to other affiliated groups.\u201d\n\nThis raises questions over whether Cambridge Analytica blurred the boundaries between official campaign groups, which have spending limits, and unaffiliated political action groups or super Pacs. \n\n\n\nThe latter can spend as much as they want but must not coordinate with the candidate they support.\n\nThe Campaign Legal Center has accused Cambridge Analytica over allegations of illegal coordination of this nature.\n\nIt has filed evidence with the FEC alleging that the super Pac Make America Number 1 made illegal contributions to Trump\u2019s campaign, \u201cengaging in unlawful coordinated spending by using the common vendor Cambridge Analytica\u201d.\n\nCambridge Analytica said it had never claimed to have won the election for Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThis is patently absurd. We are proud of the work we did on that campaign, and have spoken in many public forums about what we consider to be our contribution to the campaign.\u201d\n\nIt said there was no evidence of coordination between the Make America Number 1 super Pac and the Trump campaign. The company said it was not under investigation.\n\nIt has accused the Channel 4 News undercover investigation of grossly misrepresenting how the company conducts its business.\n\n\n\nHowever, speaking to the BBC on Monday, Nix said he had \u201chuge amounts of regret that we undertook this meeting and spoke with a certain amount of hyperbole\u201d.\n\nOn Tuesday the website Politico reported that Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign was moving to distance itself from Cambridge Analytica.

They aren\u2019t out there saying, \u2018Don\u2019t vote for anything unless we have everything\u2019.\u201d\n\nBut Rubio also warned against the increasingly partisan nature of the guns debate, which he said could halt the momentum behind a new spirit of bipartisan compromise on issues that include gun violence restraining orders and raising the minimum age restrictions for purchasing firearms.\n\n\u201cThe attitude of total victory -- the idea that somehow some of us are going to come up here and get everything we want and just run over the other side -- our system is just not set up for that,\u201d Rubio said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re creating unrealistic expectations and, in the process, nothing happens.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Republican senator rejected in particular the notion that an assault weapons ban should serve as a litmus test, suggesting such an approach was neither pragmatic nor productive.\n\nRubio was interviewed as part of the guest-editing of the Guardian US site by student journalists from the Eagle Eye, the newspaper of Stoneman Douglas. The students requested the interview with the Florida senator because they particularly wanted to put questions directly to lawmakers from both parties as part of the collaboration.\n\nRubio sat down with the Guardian on Capitol Hill on Thursday, shortly after unveiling a so-called \u201cred flag\u201d bill, which would encourage states to adopt policies allowing law enforcement officials or family members to file gun restraining orders to remove firearms from potentially violent individuals. \n\n\n\nRubio\u2019s home state of Florida, as well as a handful of others, have enacted such laws. Orlando police have already credited the law with preventing a potential mass shooting.\n\n\n\nCongress also appeared close to sending a spending bill to Donald Trump\u2019s desk, which included measures that would: reverse a ban on gun violence research; and amend the existing background checks system. Rubio is a co-sponsor of the latter proposalwhich does not close loopholes for private sales or purchases at gun shows but tightens measures to ensure that states and federal agencies are actually entering the proper records into the federal background check system.\n\nRubio said he remains supportive of further gun controls, such as raising the age restriction for purchasing some firearms from 18 to 21, but he predicted it would take longer to corral enough votes. The senator also suggested he was open to new limits on high capacity magazines but had yet to coalesce around a specific proposal.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried to rank these things, not just in order of how quickly we can pass them, but how effective they would be,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI believe the most effective thing we can do to prevent gun violence is to identify potential attackers and stop them before they act.\u201d\n\nRubio had a meteoric rise as a young senator, but his bid for the Republican presidential nomination last year came to a halt when Donald Trump beat him in his home state primary.\n\nRubio subsequently chose to seek re-election to the Senate, reversing an earlier pledge to leave Congress. In doing so, he cited in part another mass shooting in Florida \u2013 the June 2016 attack at the LGBT Orlando nightclub Pulse.\n\nThat shooting, as with the spate of others since the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school massacre, failed to produce any new laws in Washington. \n\n\n\nAfter Pulse, in which an alleged Islamic State sympathizer gunned down 49 people and wounded 58 others, Rubio proposed legislation that would make it more difficult for suspected terrorists to purchase firearms. The proposal went nowhere in the Senate.\n\n\n\nAs a 2016 presidential candidate, Rubio positioned himself as a staunch proponent of the second amendment right to bear arms. Critics have been quick to point to the roughly $3.3m Rubio has received from the National Rifle Association\u2019s political arm as evidence of the gun lobby\u2019s influence over his posture toward gun control.\n\nRubio has insisted his donors do not dictate his agenda, but rather buy into it, and refused to commit to no longer taking money from the NRA when he was put on the spot on live television by a Parkland student during last month\u2019s CNN town hall.\n\nHe chafed at the notion that his approach to the gun debate was shaped by the NRA line, telling the Guardian he found the relentless focus on one group counterproductive to bipartisan talks.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a terrible way to judge public policy \u2013 an idea is either a good idea or a bad idea,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThis fixation on one group versus another group in our debate \u2026 I get why people are out there doing it for political purposes, but in my view we should judge ideas by whether they work or don\u2019t work \u2013 not by who supports them or who opposes them.\u201d\n\nSome of the Parkland students disagree with Rubio\u2019s line of defense. David Hogg, one of the more high-profile activists in the aftermath of the shooting, called out Rubio by name during a Thursday press conference on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u2018If you want to continue to be supported by the NRA, like Marco Rubio, that\u2019s OK,\u201d Hogg said, \u201cBecause we\u2019ll vote you out.

We are looking for a candidate with a history in some aspect of the adult entertainment industry,\u201d read the ad placed in 2008.\n\nVitter, the Republican senator from Louisiana who championed family values, had been ensnared in a prostitution scandal and some cheeky pranksters wanted to troll him on it.\n\nBut soon, what started as a gonzo prank idea was turning into something if not serious then at least real. \u201cWE HAVE FOUND OUR PORN STAR,\u201d read a follow-up post.\n\nThe porn star in question was Daniels, and in no time she was grabbing national headlines with her slogan that promised \u201cScrewing People Honestly\u201d \u2013 unlike her male opponent.\n\nAs wild as that was, that turned out to only be the prelude to Stormy Daniels\u2019 main event. She currently faces a much more powerful male adversary, the president of the United States, as she prepares to go public on Sunday in a TV interview to give details about her alleged 2006 affair with Donald Trump.\n\nThe interview with Anderson Cooper, which is expected to break viewership records for CBS\u2019s venerable 60 Minutes news magazine show, is easy to dismiss as frivolity. But her allegations, and the legal maneuvers Trump\u2019s allies have employed to try to keep them quiet, could have implications spanning not just sex and sexual politics \u2013 but campaign finance laws and violence against women.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know who become the pivotal players in history,\u201d said Jonathan Tilove, who chronicled Daniels\u2019 first steps in politics as a correspondent for the New Orleans Times-Picayune.\n\nBorn Stephanie Gregory Clifford in Baton Rouge in 1979, Daniels grew up with her mother, who worked as a trucking company manager. Her dad was seldom around. As a girl she loved dancing and horses, but if her parents hoped she might pursue a childhood dream of becoming a vet, it was not to be. She left home and began stripping at 17; by 21 she was performing in adult films under the stage name Stormy Daniels.\n\nShe considers it her real name, but her mother, Sheila Gregory, can\u2019t abide it.\n\n\u201cMy daughter\u2019s name is Stephanie, not Stormy,\u201d she said when the Guardian reached her at home Tuesday. \u201cPlease forgive me if you think I\u2019m being rude,\u201d she added, before hanging up.\n\nGregory may not have made peace with her daughter\u2019s career, but by any measure, Daniels is extremely successful at what she does, both in front of the camera and behind it. She started directing in her mid-20s, and won best new starlet at the 2004 AVN awards, referred to as the \u201cthe Oscars of porn\u201d. The following year, she made a number of cameos in mainstream film, including Judd Apatow\u2019s blockbuster hit The 40-Year-Old Virgin. (On social media, Apatow has said he admires her work.)\n\nIn 2009, when her Louisiana campaign began, Daniels was living in Florida and not registered with either party. And as those who worked with her, most of whom did not want to speak on the record, quickly realized, she was not going to be a prop, but sensed opportunity. \u201cShe was smart enough to know that we weren\u2019t trying to drag her through some college prank, that maybe this was an avenue to explore,\u201d said a person with knowledge of the campaign.\n\nHer platform, thin though it was, was socially liberal and fiscally conservative. But mainly it was about trolling Vitter, and she was a master provocateur. Asked if she was pro-life, for instance, she said she was \u201cpro-condom\u201d. Asked if she really just wanted to embarrass Vitter, she replied flatly: \u201cI don\u2019t see how I could possibly embarrass him more than he\u2019s already embarrassed himself.\u201d\n\nMost notable though, was her ability to stay in the public eye, despite her never formally entering the race. \u201cIt was clear she was smart, prepared and comfortable with the media frenzy,\u201d said Democratic operative Bradley Beychok, who met with Daniels during a \u201clistening tour\u201d in Baton Rouge.\n\nThe Craigslist post turned what should have been a low-key election into a national spectacle, and Louisiana is just quirky enough of a place that national election forecaster Nate Silver didn\u2019t rule her out. \u201cShe\u2019s certainly not without her, um, charms,\u201d Silver wrote at the time.\n\nDaniels\u2019 campaign would prove quite literally explosive. At the height of her political momentum, the Audi belonging to her political manager burst into flames, and though no one was ever apprehended, blurry surveillance footage showed someone loitering around the car and getting into it shortly before it detonated.\n\nSoon after that, and amid a domestic violence arrest, Daniels opted out of the race. Vitter would go on to win, riding the wave of anti-Obama backlash in 2010. But when he ran for governor a few years later, his Democratic opponent won in an upset by reviving the prostitution scandal that Daniels had worked to highlight.\n\nToday, as she prepares to take on the president, Daniels is \u2013 improbably, perhaps, at 39 \u2013 on top of her industry, with a confidence and acerbic Twitter profile to match.\n\nHer second foray into politics began in February, when the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, had paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about her story just before the 2016 election.\n\nIn response to the bombshell, the tabloid In Touch Weekly published an interview with Daniels it had been sitting on since 2011, kept under wraps due to legal threats from Trump\u2019s circle. In the interview, Daniels describes in explicit detail a consensual, nearly year-long sexual dalliance with Trump, allegedly begun weeks after his wife Melania gave birth to their son, Barron.\n\nSunday\u2019s interview, however, will be the first time Daniels has spoken about the matter since Trump forged his own political career, and the first time she will address the efforts to muzzle her, which she has been fighting in court.\n\nDetails from Daniels\u2019 account further shape the narratives that first emerged about Trump and his relationship with women during the 2016 election. More than a dozen women came forward to accuse Trump of sexual harassment and assault in the lead-up to the election. And while Daniels\u2019 alleged affair with Trump was consensual, the context is nonetheless informative about how he views women.\n\nAnd Daniels is not alone. Another adult film star, Jessica Drake, who accused Trump of trying to buy sex from her, claims she also has \u201cconfidential information\u201d about Trump\u2019s relationship with Daniels, according to a 2016 non-disclosure agreement or NDA.\n\nOn Tuesday, the former Playboy model Karen McDougal became the second woman this month to challenge Trump\u2019s efforts to silence her, announcing she was suing the president to be released from a 2016 legal agreement that restricted her ability to speak about her alleged affair with the future president.\n\nSeparately, a judge this month ruled that a defamation suit brought by former Apprentice star Summer Zervos, who accused Trump of harassing her, may go forward, clearing the path for other sexual misconduct allegations against the president to be aired.\n\n\u201cIt is settled that the president of the United States has no immunity and is \u2018subject to the laws\u2019 for purely private acts,\u201d the judge declared, citing the precedent set by a lawsuit brought against Bill Clinton by his alleged mistress Paula Jones two decades ago.\n\nMeanwhile, the president, who has denied all the claims brought against him, remains committed to keeping Daniels quiet.\n\nDaniels\u2019 legal team, in a clever bit of maneuvering, has offered to pay back every dollar she was paid in the NDA for the chance to speak freely. Her team claims the agreement is null and void because Trump never signed it, and they are moving ahead with the CBS interview despite a threat from Trump\u2019s camp of up to $20m in damages.\n\nDaniels now has a target on her back, and her lawyer has said she\u2019s been physically threatened and is under 24-hour security. But her background in adult entertainment may give her a rare liberty other women Trump has tried to shame into silence do not possess. Namely, she is not easily embarrassed and she doesn\u2019t care if people don\u2019t like her.\n\n\u201cSlut and whore are words used by people who feel threatened,\u201d she responded to a troll on Twitter who accused her of promiscuity. \u201cI find power in them.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "David Smith In Washington", "body": "Donald Trump bragged that he made up facts in a meeting with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, according to an audio recording obtained by the Washington Post.\n\nThe US president \u2013 notorious for making false claims on countless issues \u2013 admitted he told Trudeau that America has a trade deficit with its neighbour when he \u201chad no idea\u201d if that was true.\n\nThe office of the US trade representative states that the American goods and services trade surplus with Canada was $12.5bn in 2016.\n\nAccording to the recording, Trump told guests at a fundraising dinner in Missouri: \u201cTrudeau came to see me. He\u2019s a good guy, Justin. He said, \u2018No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none.

Last year, in honour of Canada Day, the president used Twitter to praise his \u201cnew found friend\u201d north of the border.\n\nTrump defied critics in his own Republican party last week to announce stiff import taxes on steel and aluminium, risking a trade war with China and the European Union (EU). His top economic adviser Gary Cohn quit over the tariffs, while secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who also disagreed with them, was fired earlier this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Post report says, the president again lambasted the EU, China, Japan and South Korea, which he claimed were taking advantage of America. He also described the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) as a disaster and appeared to threaten to pull US troops out of South Korea if the country does not come up with a satisfactory trade deal.\n\n\u201cWe have a very big trade deficit with them, and we protect them,\u201d Trump was quoted as telling donors. \u201cWe lose money on trade, and we lose money on the military. We have right now 32,000 soldiers between North and South Korea. Let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOur allies care about themselves. They don\u2019t care about us.\u201d\n\nAfter visiting a Boeing factory in St Louis earlier in the day, Trump was headlining a fundraiser for Republican US Senate candidate Josh Hawley, who is running for the seat held by Democrat Claire McCaskill.\n\nBut as is his wont, the president boasted about his 2016 presidential election victory, derided cable news anchors and mocked his predecessors, George W Bush and Barack Obama, for failing to achieve what he has done by setting up a meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. \u201cIt\u2019s called appeasement: please don\u2019t do anything,\u201d he reportedly said.\n\nTrump made 2,140 false or misleading claims in his first year as president, according to a Washington Post count.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Jon Swaine In New York", "body": "He said he was a multimillionaire \u2013 an international property developer with a plan to fix America\u2019s cities through radical privatization.

Citing connections across the military, business and academia, he said: \u201cI bring, and draw on, experiences from different areas of knowledge, like a polymath.\u201d\n\nJafry was contracted to work for Trump\u2019s housing and urban development department (Hud). His government email signature said his title was senior adviser. Jafry said he used his role to advocate for \u201cmicrocities\u201d, where managers privately set their own laws and taxes away from central government control.\n\nBut those plans are now stalled. Jafry, 38, said he had resigned from his position with Hud after the Guardian asked him to explain multiple allegations of fraud as well as exaggerations in his biography.\n\nJafry, who has also been known by Jafari and Jafri, apologised for inflating his military record but denied making other false claims. He said he resigned because the Guardian\u2019s questions tarnished his reputation inside Hud.\n\n\u201cYou and I both know we live in the world of opinion and facts merging together,\u201d he said.\n\nHud declined to discuss Jafry. The finding may present new problems for Ben Carson, Trump\u2019s Hud secretary. Internal emails on Wednesday indicated Carson and his wife \u201cpicked out\u201d a controversial $31,000 furniture set for his office, after Carson said he had had no involvement.\n\nStyling himself as an \u201centrepreneur and philanthropist\u201d, Jafry said he controlled a multimillion-dollar trust fund built since 1885 by relatives in India. According to court records, however, he struggled to pay rent and bills while engaging in a series of failed takeovers of gas stations and other ventures in Texas over the past decade.\n\nIn November 2013, a judge ordered Jafry and a fuel company he chaired to repay more than $800,000 to the family of Alfred Oglesby, a former NFL player and investor in the fuel firm, who died in 2009. Oglesby\u2019s widow accused Jafry of fraud. Jafry has not paid the money. Debt collectors said they had been trying to locate him for years.\n\nDavid Freedman, an attorney for Oglesby\u2019s family, said he was surprised Jafry had resurfaced in an influential role in the government. \u201cIf he is advising Donald Trump we\u2019re screwed \u2013 we should just surrender to North Korea right now,\u201d said Freedman.\n\nJafry denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations. He said he never received Oglesby\u2019s investment, so he didn\u2019t owe Oglesby\u2019s family money.\n\nHaving arrived in the US in about 2005, Jafry was the subject of several other legal actions in Texas. Owners of gas stations that Jafry tried to buy sued him and his business associates, repeatedly accusing Jafry of fraud and breaching contracts.\n\nJafry denied wrongdoing. Two lawsuits were settled; a third was dismissed after Jafry did not respond and the plaintiffs failed to locate him. He said the deals collapsed because one owner made false claims about his property, while another failed to disclose that nearby construction work would harm trade.\n\nIn February 2008, Jafry drew up a list of his holdings that said his personal wealth totalled $18.3m. The document, which was later filed to court, attributed most of his wealth to 164 acres of residential land in Mumbai, where he was raised.\n\nYet after the filing of an eviction lawsuit in September 2010, Jafry was ordered by a Texas court to leave his four-bedroom home in Richmond and give the landlord $10,000, after failing to pay rent for seven months. He was also sued by the local power company after failing to pay his $4,300 bill.\n\nJafry said the 2008 document was accurate at the time, but that his wealth had since evaporated because his claim to the Mumbai land was revoked by relatives unhappy with his troubled US ventures. He said he had already left the rented house when the eviction lawsuit was filed after being unsatisfied with the property.\n\nInitially, Jafry told the Guardian he had been hired to work on Hud\u2019s envision centers, which work to reduce the number of people dependent on public housing. He later said he had not worked there after all, but declined to explain. Hud declined repeated requests to clarify what Jafry worked on.\n\nAsked in the earlier interview whether he had discussed microcities with Carson, Jafry said: \u201cWe are working on a political solution on this.\u201d Jafry said he had met Donald Trump before the 2016 election in \u201ca general setting\u201d, but declined to elaborate.\n\nIn addition to Jafry\u2019s financial issues, a series of misrepresentations or exaggerations were found in a review of his personal website, other online sources and biographical information he provided.\n\nDuring an interview, Jafry described himself as a veteran of the US army and said he was deployed to Kosovo. When confronted with his service record, though, he said he in fact served as a reservist in the army national guard, and remained in California while giving logistics support to colleagues in Kosovo.\n\nA version of Jafry\u2019s biography on his website said he held a degree in law and alternative dispute resolution from National University in La Jolla, California. Prof Jack Hamlin, chairman of National\u2019s department of professional studies, said: \u201cWe do not offer a \u2018law degree\u2019.\u201d He declined to discuss Jafry\u2019s case. Jafry later said he received a BA in pre-law studies.\n\nJafry has said that before arriving in the US, he made millions in the hospitality industry in Africa. An SEC filing from October 2007 said Jafry was a \u201cfounding partner\u201d of the Marakanelo Hotel Group in Botswana. His former website biography said he had owned a group of safari resorts and hotels in Africa which had \u201cmerged with Marakanelo Hotels\u201d, securing him a $7.5m windfall.\n\nBut Sibo Gumpo, the group commercial manager of Crest Hotels, which operates the Marakanelo sites, said in a series of emails that this was not the case. \u201cWe do not have a record of the transaction,\u201d said Gumpo.\n\nJafry has over recent years led a series of small energy-related companies operating under variants of the name Zeons.\n\nAmong the projects listed on the Zeons website under Jafry\u2019s \u201cmicrocities\u201d branding is a residential property development in Chester county, Pennsylvania, named the Sussex Estates. But this is not a microcity. According to public records, it is owned by Ram Naidu, a retired doctor.\n\n\u201cNaved does not have any financial interest in the Sussex development,\u201d Sukhi Singh, who assisted Naidu, said in an email. Singh said Naidu was a friend of Jafry\u2019s mother. Jafry said he had a verbal agreement to promote the development.\n\nRaffi Williams, a Hud spokesman, said in an email that Jafry was hired through Accel Corporation, a contractor. When this was put to Stacye Loman, the owner of Accel Corporation, she said in an email: \u201cThat is an incorrect statement.\u201d Loman then gave the names of two different companies that she said had hired Jafry. She did not answer when asked if these had been subcontracted by her company.\n\nWilliams stressed that Hud\u2019s contract with Accel \u201cwas procured in 2015\u201d. While Accel did begin providing services to Hud under the Obama administration in 2015, public records said Hud signed contracts for $2.1m worth of services from Accel in 2017 under Trump and Carson.\n\nOne record said Accel signed an $800,000 deal with Hud on 26 September 2017 to \u201cprovide expert guidance\u201d in helping senior Hud officials \u201cto embrace change and provide dynamic leadership\u201d. Jafry said he began work for Hud in October 2017.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Toby Helm", "body": "Jeremy Corbyn faces the most serious revolt by his own MPs since the failed coup of 2016 as senior figures publicly accuse him today of condoning antisemitism, while at the same time purging his inner circle of passionate pro-Europeans.\n\nMPs broke cover throughout on Saturday to demand that Corbyn appears before them on Monday evening to explain himself on both issues at the weekly meeting of the parliamentary party. One senior MP in an influential position said she expected an ugly atmosphere: \u201cHe has managed to combine antisemitism with an attack on Remainers in one weekend. This is about our identity as a progressive, tolerant, pro-European party. I am in complete despair.\u201d\n\nA formal request was sent yesterday to Corbyn\u2019s office from representatives of the powerful parliamentary committee, the representative body of Labour MPs, saying they wanted him to attend to address their concerns.\n\nIn a strongly worded statement, Angela Smith, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, who is on the committee, laid blame directly at Corbyn\u2019s door: \u201cIt is horrifying that anyone in our party \u2013 never mind the leader \u2013 should be able to condone antisemitism without facing consequences.\n\n\u201cAnd rather than facing up, Jeremy Corbyn has chosen to dissemble to defend himself. It is simply not credible to suggest that a man with his knowledge of foreign affairs did not recognise those images for what they were.\n\n\u201cMany of us would call for a formal disciplinary process, but the sad truth is that our party has been so badly undermined that no one would believe it would be meaningful. Jeremy Corbyn needs to appear before MPs on Monday to address this crisis.\u201d\n\nLabour sources said that Corbyn was not due to appear on Monday and would not do so. The initial anger came on Friday when Corbyn was asked by the Labour MP Luciana Berger, who is Jewish, to account for his apparent support for an obviously antisemitic mural in 2012.\n\nPainted by street artist Mear One, it depicted a caricatured group of Jewish financiers and capitalists playing a Monopoly-style game on a board balanced on the backs of unclothed, emaciated people. Corbyn left a supportive comment on a Facebook post by Mear One, whose real name is Kalen Ockerman, after the artist revealed his work was to be whitewashed.\n\nCorbyn\u2019s explanations on Friday, and eventual expression of \u201csincere regret\u201d that he had not looked more closely at what he now accepts is clearly an antisemitic image before questioning why it had to be removed, failed to reassure MPs or Jewish organisations. The row has blown up after a prolonged period of bitter arguments in Labour of cases of alleged antisemitism.\n\nBerger said: \u201cI want to hear from the leader on Monday, because his two responses so far have been wholly inadequate.\u201d\n\nSome MPs in the centre and on the right of the party were also concerned recently at Corbyn\u2019s qualified criticism of Moscow over the Salisbury nerve gas attacks, while there is mounting worry about the way the left is tightening its grip week by week on the machinery that runs the party.\n\nOn Friday evening, Corbyn\u2019s decision to sack shadow Northern Ireland secretary Owen Smith for his support for a second EU referendum and membership of the single market prompted more outrage in the large pro-EU wing of the party. Smith said yesterday that leaving the EU was \u201cthe biggest economic crisis that our country will have faced for many, many generations\u201d and that he believed Labour should stand against leaving the EU.\n\nLord Hain, a former Labour cabinet minister, said that Smith\u2019s sacking was reminiscent of a \u201cStalinist purge\u201d. hat made a nonsense of the leader\u2019s claims to be tolerant of a wide range of views.

In a tweet that was published shortly before his 2016 inauguration, he said he had \u201cnothing to do with Russia \u2013 no deals, no loans, no nothing\u201d.\n\nBut doubts about the veracity of that statement began to emerge last August, when the New York Times published emails from a longtime business associate of Trump called Felix Sater, who boasted that he had lined up financing for a Trump Tower in Moscow with VTB Bank, which is under US sanctions.\n\nIt is not clear from the Democrats\u2019 memo whether the deal they are referring to is the same deal mentioned in Sater\u2019s emails.\n\nIn another email obtained by the newspaper, Sater wrote that he would get \u201cPutin on this programme and we will get Donald elected\u201d.\n\nTrump eventually signed a non-binding \u201cletter of intent\u201d for the project to go forward and his attorney, Michael Cohen, told the New York Times that they had discussed the project three times. The Moscow project did not go ahead.\n\nNow the memo released by Democrats suggests investigators have confirmed that the Trump Organization was deeply involved in Moscow talks, and that the talks involved a bank that was under US sanctions. The Democrats did not indicate the source of their information.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 statement came days after Republicans on the House intelligence committee said they had concluded that Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign had not colluded with Russian operatives and that the committee was nearing the end of its investigation.\n\nAdam Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, called the decision a \u201ccapitulation\u201d to the White House. The Democrats then released a 21-page memo detailing some of the committee\u2019s findings, outstanding questions and a long list of witnesses that had yet to be questioned by the committee.\n\nThe memo stated that congressional investigators had \u2013 among many open questions \u2013 not yet determined whether Trump campaign officials had received advanced knowledge of or access to emails that had been hacked by Russians from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe memo stated that there were \u201ccritical unanswered questions\u201d about the sources of Trump\u2019s personal and corporate financing, including his relationship with his biggest lender, Deutsche Bank.\n\nIt said it needed answers about whether the Russian government, through \u201cbusiness figures close to the Kremlin\u201d, was seeking to launder funds through the Trump Organization, and whether Trump\u2019s financial exposure \u2013 through his debt with Deutsche Bank \u2013 gave a point of leverage to Russia.\n\nRepublicans on the House intelligence committee shared their own draft report about the committee\u2019s investigation with Democrats this week. Mike Conaway, a Republican from Texas, said they had not found any signs of collusion but that the panel had found some incidents of \u201cbad judgment, inappropriate meetings, inappropriate judgment at taking meetings\u201d.\n\nIt was an apparent reference to a Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 between Russian nationals and Trump campaign officials.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Press Association", "body": "Bailiffs are to be banned from entering homes at night and from using physical force against debtors under new laws coming into effect this weekend. \n\n\n\nFurther changes will also prevent enforcement agents from entering properties where only children are at home and from taking vital household essentials such as cookers, microwaves, fridges or washing machines. \n\n\n\nBailiffs, who collect roughly four million debts each year, will also have to be trained and certified to practise under a shake-up of laws designed to bring an end to aggressive behaviour. \n\n\n\nChris Grayling, the justice secretary, said: \"People will still have to face up to their debts but they will no longer need to fear their home being raided at night, the threat of violence or having their vital household equipment seized. \n\n\n\n\"We are stamping out bad practice and making sure bailiffs play by the rules.

She said something very similar just a couple of months ago and she hasn\u2019t been sacked.\n\n\u201cFor Jeremy Corbyn in particular, who\u2019s always understood the value of people standing by their principles. It\u2019s the position that he\u2019s often adopted, and it\u2019s certainly a value in him that others have extolled and, in truth, I think that\u2019s all I\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve stood by my principles on what I think is the most important economic and security issue facing our country for generations.

It\u2019s exciting and in terms of the themes of this particular conference, it is very appropriate.\n\nAgriculture is still the mainstay of the state and there are huge opportunities there. Industry and of course technology which is really a game changer, that\u2019s where there\u2019s considerable latent opportunity.\n\nWhen you look into other states, because I\u2019ve spoken to many and they talk about how some other states can take a leaf out of Ogun State\u2019s book. I mean, when you look at the IGR alone, it\u2019s gone from about N730million to over N7 billion monthly.\n\nSo what would you like the State\u2019s to take away from Ogun State?\n\nOne of the things that we\u2019ve done is the state fiscal responsibility plan which was a 21 point reform program for states and one of the things state\u2019s were required to do in exchange for help during the darkest part of the recession was to improve IGR.\n\nOne of the key metrics was to improve IGR and to come up with a plan for IGR that required things like reviewing obsolete tariffs, taking transactions cashless and improving their receipting, so we\u2019re seeing this replicated across a number of states and it has been quite exciting to see the increases in IGR across the length and breadth of the nation and that is really important in terms of fiscal responsibility for the state\u2019s because when we talk about not relying on oil we\u2019re not saying that the government should cut back we\u2019re saying that government should find another source of revenue and internally generated revenue for any state is a very very important part of that.\n\nLet\u2019s talk on the federal level. The Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration scheme, the deadline is almost here March 31st. Bring us up to speed on the progress so far?\n\nIncredible progress so far. The signs have been very very encouraging. We knew that everyone would wait until the last minute, which was something that we expected I was just speaking to the chairman of Inland revenue here in Ogun and he said look I am at N500million already and there are just a handful of people that have complied so the signs are very encouraging.\n\nFor us it proves that the data that we have and the analysis that we did are correct. We analysed the data and saw that people are clearly under declaring on a massive scale and so far I think at federal level just 226 people account for N20 billion so if you begin to extrapolate and think about the thousands of forms that are in circulation we expect that we will bring many many more people into the tax net correctly.\n\nIt is not just about paying the arrears of taxes that they should have paid but for us, what is more important is being taxed at the right level going forward.\n\nI know that there are still some people who won\u2019t come forward because they want to see if there\u2019s any bite from the side of the fiscal authorities so come March 31st. What is going to happen are you going to name and shame?\n\nWhat is going to happen is for personal taxes many of the states are working on using sort of mobile courts to fast track cases. They dont want cases to get caught up in the long legal process because tax evasion is a very easy and straight forward prosecution. They\u2019ve started looking at setting up special courts that deal with tax evasion.\n\nTax evasion is a crime and of course once people are prosecuted we feel that we should say this is the person that is being prosecuted for tax evasion and this is why so that it acts a deterrent to others. However, I am not sure that this is where our focus is.\n\nOur focus is really on getting everybody to do the right thin. These moneys were made in Nigeria and from Nigeria and it is only fair and right that some of that money is ploughed back into the system to allow some of that to go forward.\n\nSo what is going to happen after VAIDS?\n\nWe continue the focus on tax collection and we\u2019re going to focus on VAT. We\u2019re also going to focus on getting the number of tax payers up.\n\nAccording to the latest figures I\u2019ve got from the Federal Inland and Revenue Service, we are now at 17 million and that\u2019s a huge achievement because I believe we were at 13 million Nigerians when we came in.\n\nBut, there are 65 million people who are economically active so there\u2019s a long way to go. There is a lot of work still to be done in the tax system.\n\nVAIDS is just one of many reforms. The other reforms that we are working on are constant updates to our tax laws. Some of our tax laws are obsolete. We haven\u2019t updated them or come up to speed with different commercial realities.\n\nFor example, we have not got a strategy for taxing e-commerce. A lot of transactions are now happening online. How do we get them into our tax net? SO there is constant work to be done in our tax policy.\n\nBut is that in the works already?\n\nAbsolutely we have a national tax policy that FEC approved and we have a national committee that pulls together academia, the private sector, the public sector, and the collecting agents and they have policy meetings where they work and look at the tax laws and recommend changes.\n\nThe first set should hopelly go to FEC in the next couple of weeks and then from there they\u2019ll go to the national assembly so it is a constant process of upgrading and updating and making sure that our tax laws are not only effective but also ease the convenience in terms of payment.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about government debt. Bring us up to speed.\n\nThe first thing to say about our core debt strategy is that it remains conservative. In terms of debt to GDP ratio we are at 21. The upper limit for a developing economy is recommended at 40.\n\nSome of our neighbours not too far from here are as high as 60, some are at 80. Our debt to GDP ratio is very low and we intend to stay in the low range.\n\nHowever, there is a desperate need for investment and that investment has got to be financed and that investment is long term investment. The only way you can finance these things is through long term debt.\n\nOur needs to develop roads and power are prevalent and they are long term assets so we have to match them with long term liabilities.\n\nOur strategy as far as debt is concerned is to have longer term debt, which is why we refinanced treasury bills which mature in 120 \u2013 180 days and moved that to 20 -30 years.\n\nWe\u2019re matching the lifespan of the asset with the liability and as you pointed out previously by moving on to external debt we are creating head room for the private sector.\n\nWe are also creating head room for the monetary authorities. Hopefully when the conditions allow, they\u2019ll begin to bring down interest rates.

Nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants, ambulance staff and all other workers except doctors and dentists would benefit from the scrapping of the hated pay cap. Doctors and dentists have a separate pay review system.\n\nThe deal the government is preparing to formally put to staff later this month would also see some NHS personnel get pay rises of 10% and, in certain circumstances, well above that by 2021. Those on the bottom of the NHS\u2019s nine pay scales would get a bigger uplift under Agenda for Change \u2013 the agreement that governs the earnings of health service staff \u2013 than colleagues who earn more because they are higher up that pay band.\n\nThe 14 health unions that have been negotiating the details of the government\u2019s offer, in conditions of strict secrecy, are cautiously optimistic they will feel able to recommend it and that their members, who include Unison, Royal College of Nursing, Unite, the GMB and Chartered Society of Physiotherapists, will endorse it.\n\nSources close to the talks say they have been constructive, businesslike and highly detailed, with both sides keen to see NHS staff pay improved as much as possible. A plan for the chancellor Philip Hammond to unveil the offer in his Spring Statement next Tuesday has been abandoned, however, as there are still some sticking points to be resolved.\n\nMinisters\u2019 determination that staff forfeit a day\u2019s holiday in return for the pay rise could derail the chances of the Treasury and unions agreeing a deal, especially if that provokes a backlash among staff, many of whom already do regular unpaid overtime and have seen their real incomes cut by up to 14% by the years of austerity-era tiny rises.\n\nBut government negotiators have made clear that staff working one extra day a year is a \u201cred line\u201d that for them is non-negotiable. If union members refuse to accept that, ministers will withdraw their offer in its entirety and may impose the 1% pay rise that was planned before anger at eight years of zero and 1% public sector pay rises proved so politically damaging for the Conservatives in last year\u2019s general election campaign.\n\nThe issue of NHS pay twice left Theresa May looking out of touch when she was quizzed on it live on television. On BBC1\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, she said there were \u201cmany complex reasons\u201d why people went to foodbanks when asked why some nurses were doing that. And she first insisted that \u201cthere\u2019s no magic money tree\u201d when confronted by an NHS nurse, only to find a \u00a31bn \u201cbribe\u201d to win the support of Democratic Unionist party MPs in key votes when her government lost its parliamentary majority.\n\nThe unions may be helped in selling the package to their members by ministers agreeing not to change their system of pay increments. Also known as \u201cprogression pay\u201d, this gives about half of staff 3% or 4% annual rises on top of their annual increase. Jeremy Hunt, the health and social care secretary, had signalled last autumn that it may be reworked to help deliver the \u201cproductivity improvements\u201d that Hammond was demanding as part of the deal to lift the paycap. That will now come from staff losing one of their 27 days annual holiday entitlement.\n\nSimon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, on Wednesday backed staff\u2019s plea for a pay rise after seven years of wage restraint and said action was needed in order to help tackle the service\u2019s growing problems in retaining staff. In a speech Stevens again made clear his view that the government should wholly fund whatever increase is finally decided, given the NHS\u2019s deep financial problems.\n\nNigel Edwards, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust thinktank, said: \u201cIf the government makes a proposal like that obtained by the Guardian, staff, especially those paid least, will welcome the respite from a real-term squeeze on their wages which has cost them billions. With very serious shortages of staff, government is right to conclude that an austerity approach to the NHS workforce has reached its limits.\u201d\n\nBut, Edwards added, losing a day\u2019s leave would in effect be a pay cut of 0.4%, even with the salary increase.\n\nProf Anita Charlesworth, director of research at the Health Foundation, said: \u201cThe NHS needs urgent action to turn around nurse recruitment and retention. One in 10 nursing posts are unfilled and an increasing number of staff are leaving the NHS.\n\n\u201cImproving pay, especially for those on lower incomes, is very important. However, pay is not a panacea. Nurses report that two of the most important factors causing them to leave the NHS are worries about quality of care and lack of work-life balance.

Bolton is the hawk\u2019s hawk, the neocon\u2019s neocon (though he rejects that label, preferring \u201cGoldwater conservative\u201d after the presidential candidate deemed too extreme by the American people in 1964). His published work includes \u201cTo Stop Iran\u2019s Bomb, Bomb Iran\u201d, \u201cThe Legal Case for Striking North Korea First\u201d and \u201cHow to Defund the UN\u201d. As George W Bush\u2019s under secretary of state for arms control he was a rabidly enthusiastic supporter of the invasion of Iraq, and seems never to have fallen out of love with the doctrine of intervention, despite the catastrophe he helped engineer.\n\nAs Trump re-ran the Apprentice but for the job of America\u2019s top diplomat, dangling the prize of secretary of state in front of Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani, Bolton\u2019s name was increasingly mentioned. But there was a sticking point: facial hair. \u201cDonald was not going to like that moustache,\u201d an associate of the president-elect told the Washington Post. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone that\u2019s really close to Donald that has a beard that he likes.\u201d\n\nBolton had fallen foul of the \u201cright out of central casting\u201d test. He didn\u2019t look the part, unlike the don\u2019t-mess-with-me-faced defence secretary James Mattis, or the bullet-headed national security adviser HR McMaster. That and the fact that the Republican Rand Paul vowed to block his appointment, which would have required Senate confirmation (\u201cHe should get nowhere close to the State Department.\u201d) As a result, he remained outside the inner circle, having to content himself with opining on Fox News. Until Thursday.\n\nBolton is now national security adviser-designate, after McMaster was fired (the position doesn\u2019t require congressional approval). And, once again, Trump\u2019s top team looks like a bunch of rats in a sack, with no internal coherence or logic. The president ran as an anti-interventionist, repeatedly complaining about all the money America spent fighting wars, particularly Iraq. His soft line on Russia couldn\u2019t be further from Bolton\u2019s antagonistic approach.\n\nSo what does moustache-man\u2019s promotion signal? Is there now going to be a decisive shift in favour of military intervention in Iran, North Korea and elsewhere, as Bolton would no doubt prefer?\n\n\n\nThe world is right to be nervous. But there is good reason to think that Bolton\u2019s tenure may not mark an ideological sea-change. There are many causes of the Trump administration\u2019s dysfunction. Prime among them is the idiosyncratic criteria the president applies to senior appointments. Candidates are not selected for their ability to all pull in one direction, with a grand strategy in mind. Nor for their intelligence or experience. Mattis didn\u2019t become defence secretary because of his erudition, but at least in part because Trump heard he was nicknamed \u201cMad Dog\u201d. McMaster wasn\u2019t chosen because of his book about the importance of military men challenging political leaders, but because Trump goes weak at the knees when he sees a three-star general. Bolton wasn\u2019t picked for his penchant for pre-emption, but because he regularly pops up on Trump\u2019s TV, which is almost always tuned to the same channel.\n\nAs he attempts to make his presence felt in the West Wing, Bolton is likely to meet resistance from Mattis and the president\u2019s chief of staff John Kelly, who are said to be \u201csceptical\u201d of him. And he appears to have struck some kind of bargain to moderate his bellicose instincts. One source told CNN\u2019s White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins that \u201cBolton promised Trump \u2018he wouldn\u2019t start any wars\u2019 if he selected him as the new national security adviser\u201d.\n\nBut even if he sticks to that somewhat pat promise, we can still expect him to exert influence over the president\u2019s thinking, particularly on Iran, where they two are more or less of the same mind. Both Rex Tillerson, recently sacked as secretary of state, and McMaster, were proponents of maintaining the Obama-era deal designed to put the brakes on Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme. Trump has made no secret of his disdain for it, and now he will be backed up to the hilt by his own national security adviser. So we can expect this enormous diplomatic achievement to be shredded, despite European efforts to the contrary. But \u201cbomb Iran\u201d? So long as there are at least some adults left in the room that\u2019s unlikely.

The appointment of John Bolton as National Security Advisor \u2013 following the nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State \u2013 could be the beginning of Trump\u2019s march to war. Or wars.\n\nThe timing is not coincidental. In May, Trump will likely rip up the diplomatic agreement that has prevented Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, sparking a period of heightened tensions with Iran and removing one of the final barriers to escalating military conflict with Iran across the Middle East.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s upcoming summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un fails \u2013 as is highly likely \u2013 the next step could be preventive military action.\n\nTwo wars, on two fronts, with incalculable costs.\n\nIf you\u2019re not scared yet, you should be. John Bolton has been thinking about this for a long time.\n\nIn 1998, Bolton signed a letter encouraging then-President Bill Clinton to invade Iraq. As Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs from 2001 to 2005, Bolton was a senior George W Bush administration official helping orchestrate the invasion of Iraq.\n\nAs one career State Department official who worked with Bolton wrote, \u201cJohn Bolton was a key player in the early machinations toward war of the George W Bush administration\u201d who \u201cknew very well how the administration was misrepresenting\u201d the intelligence about the existence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Not even years of catastrophe in Iraq after the invasion sobered Bolton\u2019s views: he said in 2015: \u201cI still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct.\u201d\n\nThat Trump \u2013 who claimed (falsely) to have opposed the Iraq War \u2013 named Bolton his national security advisor just days after the 15th anniversary of the beginning of the invasion of Iraq is some very sick irony.\n\nIran is in Bolton\u2019s sights. In 2015, Bolton wrote an op-ed advocating military strikes on Iran, claiming that: \u201cThe inconvenient truth is that only military action like Israel\u2019s 1981 attack on Saddam Hussein\u2019s Osirak reactor in Iraq or its 2007 destruction of a Syrian reactor, designed and built by North Korea, can accomplish what is required.\u201d\n\nAnd just when one thought that Trump\u2019s embrace of diplomacy with North Korea\u00a0might have indicated a new, more peaceful direction in US policy, Bolton\u2019s entrance to the White House should disabuse everyone of that notion. \n\n\n\nBolton supports preventive military strikes against North Korea: \u201cit is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current \u2018necessity\u2019 posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons by striking first.\u201d In a recent appearance on Fox News, Bolton appeared to hint that if Kim doesn\u2019t come to the table ready to hand over his nukes, military action could follow.\n\nSome may claim that this is yet another chaotic staff change in a White House where all staff is eventually discarded, and the only opinion that matters is that of Trump. And that may very well be true. But with such a reckless, impulsive president, all that stands between Trump and disastrous wars is a short meeting with his advisors to place the orders.\n\nThe appointment of John Bolton just moved America one very large step closer to that disastrous moment. Bolton may be a radical, but he\u2019s not incompetent. He\u2019s a weekly feature on Fox News, practically providing Trump his Presidential Daily Briefing. He is a highly skilled bureaucratic fighter. It doesn\u2019t take much to imagine Bolton in the Oval Office telling Trump to bomb Iran and North Korea; that Obama didn\u2019t have the guts to do it; that it will cement his place in history.\n\nThe job of the national security advisor is to work with the relevant US government agencies to compile policy options for the president. There\u2019s no reason to believe that Bolton will push anything but his own radical views, as illustrated by his cherry-picking of Iraq intelligence while at the State Department. With Mike Pompeo \u2013 a hawk on Iran and North Korea, and a true Trump enabler \u2013 likely headed to State, the internal obstacles to catastrophic military decisions are being removed.\n\nSecretary of Defense James Mattis \u2013 with his relatively moderate views on matters of war and peace \u2013 now could be the last man standing between America and the abyss.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThis is not only a time for concern, but also for action. Every American needs to speak out against this appointment. While Bolton\u2019s new position does not require Senate confirmation (Bolton was so radical he could not get confirmed by a Republican Senate in 2005), Trump must hear a chorus of voices in Congress express grave concern and make clear that they will act to prevent Trump from starting unnecessary wars. \n\n\n\nThe Senate must vote down the nomination of Pompeo.

The memo reportedly claims the FBI had an anti-Trump bias when it sought a warrant from the US foreign intelligence surveillance court to collect intelligence on Carter Page, an adviser to the Trump campaign. The Fisa court is a secret court that examines law enforcement requests to surveil Americans who are suspected of acting as foreign agents.\n\nThe Republican memo reportedly alleges that the FBI relied on the Steele dossier, which was partly paid for using Democratic funds, in seeking the Carter Page warrant, according to the New York Times.\n\nDemocrats have said that the Republican allegations are misleading and based on selective use of classified materials. Justice Department officials have said the release of the document, because of the classified elements, would be \u201cextraordinarily reckless\u201d.\n\nTrump now has five days to decide whether the Nunes document should become public.\n\nThe Shearer memo was provided to the FBI in October 2016.\n\nIt was handed to them by Steele \u2013 who had been given it by an American contact \u2013 after the FBI requested the former MI6 agent provide any documents or evidence that could be useful in its investigation, according to multiple sources.\n\nThe Guardian was told Steele warned the FBI he could not vouch for the veracity of the Shearer memo, but that he was providing a copy because it corresponded with what he had separately heard from his own independent sources.\n\nAmong other things, both documents allege Donald Trump was compromised during a 2013 trip to Moscow that involved lewd acts in a five-star hotel.\n\nThe Shearer memo cites an unnamed source within Russia\u2019s FSB, the state security service. The Guardian cannot verify any of the claims.\n\nShearer is a controversial figure in Washington. Conservative outlets have accused him of being part of a \u201chatchet man\u201d and member of a \u201csecret spy ring\u201d and within Clinton\u2019s orbit. There is no evidence that the Clinton campaign was aware of the Shearer memo.\n\nBut other people who know Shearer say he is not just a Democratic party hack and there is no evidence that his memo was ever sought by Clinton campaign officials.\n\nSources say that while he lacks the precision and polish of a seasoned former spy like Steele, Shearer has also been described as having a large network of sources around the world and the independent financial means to pursue leads.\n\nThe White House has vigorously denied allegations that the US president was ever compromised and has rejected claims that campaign officials ever conspired with the Kremlin ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nSteele\u2019s dossier, his motives for writing it and his decision to share it remain controversial among Republicans.\n\nHe says he approached the FBI about concerns he had about links between Russia and the Trump campaign after he was commissioned to investigate the matter by a private investigative firm called Fusion GPS on behalf of the firm\u2019s clients.\n\nGlenn Simpson, the founder of Fusion GPS, told congressional investigators that Steele approached the FBI out of a sense of duty and concern for US national security.\n\nRepublican supporters of Trump have derided it as \u201cfake news\u201d. Chuck Grassley, a Republican senator from Iowa and ally of Trump, has called for an investigation into Steele amid unspecified allegations about the former spy\u2019s conduct.\n\nDemocrats have said the campaign against Steele is part of an effort to seek to discredit him in order to shift attention away from allegations about Trump and Russia.\n\nA spokesman for the US special counsel leading the criminal investigation into the Trump campaign declined to comment.

It was just before Christmas and she flew out to meet them in Washington DC. It was all a bit ridiculous. It was only six to eight weeks before the election and they were looking to spend nearly $2m.\u201d\n\nThe election was a big deal. At stake, the future of the most populous country in Africa, and potential access to its lucrative oil reserves. The sitting president was favourite to win, though Buhari was doing unexpectedly well.\n\nNot least because his team had hired AKPD, once the firm of former Barack Obama strategist David Axelrod, which was pushing a slick, social media heavy Obama-esque message of hope.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of scared millionaires worried that Buhari would get in. It was all very last-minute. A team flew out to Abuja and put together a communications campaign. It was a straightforward, normal comms campaign in most respects,\u201d the employee said.\n\nMost but not all respects. The Observer has obtained an astonishing and disturbing video that Cambridge Analytica used in the campaign.\n\n\u201cComing to Nigeria on February 15th, 2015,\u201d the voiceover says in the manner of a trailer for a Hollywood movie.\n\n\u201cDark. Scary. And very uncertain. Sharia for all.\u201d And then it poses the question: \u201cWhat would Nigeria look like if sharia were imposed by Buhari?\u201d\n\nIts answer to that question is certainly dark. And scary. It\u2019s also graphically, brutally, violent. One minute and 19 seconds of archive news footage from Nigeria\u2019s troubled past set to a horror movie soundtrack.\n\nThere are scenes of people being macheted to death. Their legs hacked off. Their skulls caved in. A former contractor said: \u201cIt was voter suppression of the most crude and basic kind. It was targeted at Buhari voters in Buhari regions to basically scare the shit out of them and stop them from voting.\u201d\n\nIf Buhari wins, the film warns: women would wear the veil. Sharia law would be introduced. And the inference is, you may be macheted to death.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just videos spreading fear. The Cambridge Analytica campaign team in Nigeria were jumpy too.\n\n\u201cIt felt risky, being there. There were various points when we were told we were in danger.\u201d And in the Abuja hotel to which the team was confined in early 2015, rumours abounded.\n\nThe tales are Graham Greene-esque. The hotel was where slick western consultants, including a team from the now disgraced Bell Pottinger, partied with their Nigerian counterparts. Mingling among them, western intelligence operatives - state backed, or privately commissioned, nobody was quite sure.\n\nAnd then there were the meetings: three sources have told the Guardian about one that took place between Cambridge Analytica employees and two people they were told were Israeli intelligence operatives.\n\n\u201cThere was a two-hour meeting that took place in the hotel lobby between two senior campaign members and Israeli intelligence. After which they swept our hotel rooms for listening devices and said they would switch out our phones. The story we were told was that there were intelligence agents from a number of different countries, including Israel and France, who were supporting Goodluck Jonathan and helping the campaigns.\u201d\n\nThere is no suggestion that Jonathan was aware of or implicated in this support. Another employee said: \u201cBasically the Israelis didn\u2019t want [Buhari] to win.\u201d\n\nOther employees questioned whether they were \u201creal\u201d Israeli intelligence operatives, or Israeli private contractors.\n\nA few weeks later, as the campaign was drawing to a close, there was another meeting at Cambridge Analytica\u2019s London office.\n\nAn expert had flown in from Israel with a laptop, sources say.\n\nAnd Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica\u2019s now suspended CEO, and Kaiser, asked employees to take a thumb drive and download the contents on to their own computers.\n\nThe content was private emails and the information, they were told, related to Buhari\u2019s financial and medical records.\n\nOne employee who was present at the London meeting said he had initially assumed the visiting expert was Mossad or Israeli intelligence passing on what he called \u201clegtimate information\u201d.\n\nBut he began to realise this wasn\u2019t the case, he said, when he saw the reaction of his colleagues. One of them had \u201cfreaked out\u201d, he said. \u201cHe was like, \u2018What the fuck? I don\u2019t want anything to do with this.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe witnesses are clear \u2013 at least in their own minds. The information they were shown had come from hackers.\n\nBack in Nigeria, the team still on the ground found out what was going on from their colleagues in London. There was more \u201cfreaking out\u201d. This time with live, pressing concerns.\n\n\u201cThey were fucking scared,\u201d said a colleague who spoke to them while they were in the country. The campaign fixer, the person with local knowledge who navigated them through the ins and outs of Nigerian politics, made it clear to them: they needed to get out of the country right away.\n\nCambridge Analytica had put them all in danger, they said. If opposition supporters found out, there was no saying what might happen.\n\nOne member of the team missed his flight and instead of asking the office to re-book it, he got the first fight out \u2013 to Dubai \u2013 and put it on his credit card. \u201cEveryone just wanted to get out as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the company said its team remained in country throughout the original campaigning period had \u201cleft in accordance with the company\u2019s campaign plan\u201d.\n\n\u201cTeam members were regularly briefed about security concerns prior to and during deployment and measures were taken to ensure the team\u2019s safety throughout.\u201d\n\nThere are multiple wider political questions about what went on in the Nigerian election of 2015 and the role western powers played. Whether western political campaigners taking lucrative foreign contracts are contributing to the democratic framework of developing countries \u2013 or helping to destroy them. If they\u2019re experimenting with methods and techniques that they later re-import back to our more developed democracies.\n\nChristopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower who spoke to the Observer, called it \u201cpost-colonial blowback\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe west found a way of firehosing disinformation into weak and vulnerable democracies. And now this has been turned back on us. This really is about our chickens coming home to roost.\u201d\n\nAnother said: \u201cEverything the company did after the Mercers got involved was about refining a set of techniques that they would go on to use in the US elections. These campaigns in other countries were experiments. They worked out how to harvest data and weaponise it. And they got steadily better at it.\u201d\n\nAnd what comes across most strongly, the sources say, is how little thought, if any, the senior directors in London had given to their employees and colleagues who became caught up in the activities, many of whom were in their early to mid-20s.\n\nOne member of staff who met the Israelis in the office on another occasion described them as \u201cspecial forces\u201d types. He said: \u201cThey were cliche alpha males with a certain intellect. Looked military, very composed. They looked like they could beat the crap out of you.\u201d\n\nThree years on, there is still stress in some of their voices when they recount these stories. Stress and fear and anger \u2013 about the danger they put in, and the lack of care shown toward them, the morally compromising position they were put in, the lack of knowledge they had about what sort of the company they would be working for when they took their jobs.\n\nIt\u2019s why, despite the personal risks, so many of them agreed to speak.\n\n\u201cWhen I took that job, I did not sign up to any of this,\u201d said one.

On Monday the EU\u2019s Michel Barnier \u2013 a secret \u201cNorwegian\u201d \u2013 could not conceal his glee at his cobbled-together transition deal, nor could his British counterpart, David Davis.\n\nThe deal was a document of the most brutal realism. For now, the UK remains a non-participating member of the single market, with freedom of movement and right of settlement. Farmers and fishers are \u201cas you were\u201d. Britain can discuss \u201coffshore\u201d trade deals, but not agree them. Hard Brexiteers can go jump off a cliff.\n\nThe smart money in Brussels was always on the Norway option. The so-called European Economic Area was a simple \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d basis for a bespoke deal with the UK. The challenge lay not in negotiating it but in overcoming Theresa May\u2019s belief that her fate depended on some 50 backbench leavers and the editors of the Sun and the Daily Mail. She was terrified of them.\n\nEven so, the assumption was that, as the March 2019 deadline approached and the impossibility of a \u201cfrictionless\u201d hard Brexit became ever clearer, Theresa May would be forced into a series of tactical retreats. The tough Lancaster House and Florence speeches, and Chequers last month, were dollops of fudge to keep hard Brexiteers on board. But this week\u2019s transition deal would mark a parting of the ways. So it has appeared. The sight of Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and assorted friends shuffling miserably into line, whimpering over dead fish, was heart-warming. So in a sense has been May\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s distraction over Russian poison, hysterically comparing Vladimir Putin to Stalin and Hitler.\n\nA detailed analysis of the Norway option in last month\u2019s Economist was unequivocally favourable. Norway in 1994 went through the same referendum debate as Britain, with the same drift towards compromise. The country remained in the European Free Trade Association (Efta). It stayed open to a single European market in goods, capital and labour, but it held aloof from the common fisheries and agriculture policies. Norway also stayed outside the EU customs union, to secure its own trade deals elsewhere. It is hard to see what substantive argument a Brexiter could have against this.\n\nNorway fiercely denies it is a \u201cvassal state\u201d. It is rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the \u201cmost democratic\u201d in the world. It must abide by EU rules on trade in goods within the EU. But so must EU members, who can be overruled by majority voting. On matters of joint concern, such as energy, Norway is consulted and heard. Its lobbying office next to the Berlaymont building is more effective than any council vote. As for the European court, the Efta court liaises with it and is rarely in conflict.\n\nTrade in services and finance is more crucial to the UK than in goods, and here both Europe and the world would remain its oyster, as this EU single market is in its infancy. As for migration, Efta arrangements embrace a register of EU nationals, controls on their citizenship and property ownership and expulsion if they are out of work for six months. A mere 20% of Norwegians regret their Efta status. Of course Norway is smaller than the UK. But the issue is whether its model is practicable. It is.\n\nThe one argument against the Norway option for Britain is that it would lie outside the customs union. How valuable this freedom is to Norway\u2019s economy is moot. Efta has laboriously reached deals with 38 countries, including Canada. But it requires a hard border with Sweden to enforce country-of-origin controls. Since such a border is anathema in Northern Ireland, Norway plus customs union with the EU makes sense. I have seen no calculation that shows an advantage to UK trade in being outside one.\n\nYes, Britain would pay into the EU for all this, as does Norway. But Norway\u2019s money is carefully earmarked for grants, scholarships and projects. Likewise there are disciplines with \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d within an EU single market. But they did not worry Thatcher when she co-invented the market in 1985. Leaving the EU would usefully repatriate some controls, as over farming, construction standards, procurement and the environment. Britain, like Norway, could opt out of fish quotas. But these are trading practicalities not issues of principle. They are about how to make the best of \u201cthe decision to leave\u201d, not about following a neo-imperial will-o\u2019-the-wisp.\n\nWhat Britons thought they were \u201cleaving\u201d in 2016 remains opaque. No replacement question was asked. Britain will withdraw from the EU, but what takes its place must be a decision for parliament. Everything we read from polls and surveys suggests there is no majority for trade barriers at Calais or a ban on European care workers or plumbers. Public opinion wants soft Brexit. It wants Norway.\n\nThe last time Norway featured prominently in the Commons was in 1940. British failure against the Nazis cost Chamberlain his job, but these events formed the basis for victory and reconstruction. Sooner or later, the Commons will debate Norway again: whether the UK should remain within a single market and customs union, however camouflaged. When that happens, May will drive her hard Brexiters into sullen acceptance or resignation. But she can tell them her hands have been tied to a Norwegian mast. If so, history could regard her twisting and tacking, her softly, softly Brexit strategy as the most brilliant of political manoeuvres.

Nor will the clueless education secretary, Betsy DeVos. But that is about the only ray of sunshine surrounding Trump\u2019s anointing former United Nations ambassador John Bolton and his Neville Chamberlain moustache. \n\n\n\nThe explosive Bolton \u2013 who is the kind of uber-hawk who will always choose conflict over conciliation \u2013 now steps into the most important national security job in government that does not require Senate confirmation.\n\nGranted, it is possible to derive a glimmer of I-told-you-so satisfaction from the total collapse of the establishment theory that a race of bemedaled generals and oil-industry titans could contain Trump. In truth, we now confront the frightening image of Trump Unchained, like a fugitive from a low-rent 1960s movie about Hercules.\n\nAll signs from the White House suggest that Trump is going to war on multiple fronts. The Bolton bombshell came just hours after the president\u2019s lead attorney, the often conciliatory John Dowd, resigned in frustration over Trump\u2019s brass-knuckle attacks on special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nIf Trump fires Mueller, it would, of course, prompt the biggest constitutional crisis since Watergate. But, at least, on the Mueller front, no nuclear weapons would be launched, except as over-wrought metaphors.\n\nAlas, Bolton as national security adviser would come equipped with a war-fighting capacity that goes far beyond mere words. Nothing is more chilling than the argument for attacking North Korea that Bolton sketched out in a Wall Journal op-ed just a few weeks ago, \u201cThe threat is imminent, and the case against pre-emption rests on the misinterpretation of a standard that derives from prenuclear, pre-ballistic-missile times.\u201d\n\nBolton\u2019s why-we-can\u2019t-wait approach might have been justified when Nikita Khrushchev was moving Soviet missiles into Cuba. But Bolton, who was a zealot about Saddam Hussein\u2019s supposedly fearsome arsenal, is now hyperventilating over a brutal, but tin-pot, despot who appears to be reaching a modus vivendi with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. \n\n\n\nMaybe if the 69-year-old Bolton had served in the military (he supported the Vietnam war from afar ... at Yale Law School), he might have learned that so-called surgical strikes can quickly degenerate into bloody messes. Instead, it is easy to imagine Bolton pressing for military action against North Korea, Iran and Venezuela all in one go.\n\nGeorge W Bush had his Axis of Evil. Bolton comes into the White House with his own Axis of Impatience.\n\nIn prior administrations, national security advisers like Condoleezza Rice regarded themselves as honest brokers between dueling factions in the cabinet. The only thing honest about Bolton is his ill-concealed contempt for traditional diplomacy. In late 2015, Bolton proposed in the Boston Globe that all future US contributions to the UN should be voluntary, depending entirely on the national mood.\n\nWith Marco Rubio, the Senate\u2019s version of a human weathervane, praising Bolton as \u201can excellent choice\u201d, not even the terminally naive expect Republicans in Congress to limit Trump\u2019s militaristic impulses. A brave bipartisan Senate effort this week to challenge the brutal and legally dicey war in Yemen mustered only 44 votes.\n\nI recently asked a senior congressional Republican why Congress is so willing to defer to Trump\u2019s clownish foreign policy antics. The honest response: \u201cMost of them feel like they don\u2019t know enough.\u201d\n\nThe only presidential parallel to Trump is Millard Fillmore, who tried to regain the White House in 1856 as the nominee of the anti-immigrant Know-Nothing party. Trump came into office as the Know-Nothing president and, as his self-confidence has risen, his knowledge base has increasingly been limited to the truth according to Fox News commentators like John Bolton.\n\nIt is time to pity the permanent staff of the White House, who constantly have to shuffle offices like desk clerks at a hot-sheet motel. But maybe it no longer matters who is advising Trump. Caught up in his own fantasy world of unappreciated greatness, the 45th president is prepared to serve as his own chief of staff, national security adviser, press secretary, political director and White House counsel. \n\n\n\nAnything left over is for Jared and Ivanka.\n\nAs for Bolton, he was the wild man in George W Bush\u2019s tragically misguided, but sane, administration.

Marielle Franco, a city councilwoman and human rights defender, was shot four times in the head by unknown assailants in a passing vehicle shortly after leaving a gathering of young black\u00a0activists. Her driver, Anderson Pedro Gomes, was also killed (Report, 16 March).\n\nLong before being elected to Rio\u2019s city council in 2016, Marielle was widely known as a tireless and fearless advocate for the rights of Afro-Brazilians, LGBT people, women and low-income communities. A gay black woman born and raised in one of Rio\u2019s poorest neighbourhoods, she campaigned relentlessly against spiralling police violence in the city\u2019s favelas.\n\nMarielle\u2019s activism earned\u00a0her many powerful enemies. She vehemently challenged the impunity surrounding extrajudicial killings of black youth by security forces and, two days before her death, had denounced the police\u2019s role in the killing of a young black man named Matheus Melo. She\u00a0was a leading critic of the military\u00a0intervention in Rio de Janeiro and was the head of a city commission tasked with monitoring the intervention.\n\nWe are deeply concerned and shocked by this commando-style killing of a woman who was a voice for the voiceless and a symbol of resistance to state-perpetrated violence, militarisation and anti-democratic forces. Given that Marielle\u2019s murder bears all the hallmarks of a targeted assassination, we call for the creation of an independent commission comprised of prominent and respected national and international human rights and legal experts and tasked with carrying out an independent investigation of the murder of Marielle Franco with the full cooperation of state judicial and police authorities.\n\nShortly before her death, Marielle asked: \u201cHow many others will have to die before this war will end?\u201d We call for justice for Marielle Franco and the daughter and the

leaflet warned that the influence of Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, could mean suburbs becoming increasingly \u201cinner city\u201d, with the union flag removed from public buildings.\n\nThe flyer, produced by Conservatives in Havering, on the eastern edge of Greater London, warns that if Labour win in May\u2019s local polls, it would result in \u201cHavering resembling boroughs like Hackney, Newham, Camden and Barking, rather than traditional parts of Essex\u201d.\n\nOther warnings on the leaflet, which features the three local Conservative councillors and Andrew Rosindell, the local Tory MP, include the claim that a Labour win would mean \u201cHavering ruled by Mayor Khan\u201d.\n\nThis would lead Romford, the main centre in Havering to \u201cbecome increasingly like an inner-city area\u201d with \u201cour cherished union jack flag being taken down \u2013 back to Labour\u2019s political correctness\u201d, it said.\n\nDavid Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, called the leaflet \u201cone long dog whistle about race\u201d, saying it marked a return to the controversial tactics used against Khan when he defeated Zac Goldsmith to become mayor in May 2016.\n\nGoldsmith was heavily criticised, including by some Conservatives, for repeatedly raising what he said were Khan\u2019s previous links to extreme Muslim figures and for not being sufficiently tough on Islamist terrorism.\n\nAndrew Boff, a senior London Conservative, said Goldsmith\u2019s tactics, which were supported by David Cameron, then the prime minister, and his ministers, had \u201cdone real damage\u201d to community relations.\n\nLammy said: \u201cThis is a really nasty leaflet from the Tory party in London and a return to the deeply divisive politics that failed so spectacularly during the 2016 mayoral campaign.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a genius to realise this leaflet is one long dog whistle about race and the diversity that the vast majority of Londoners are so proud of. The Tory party clearly haven\u2019t changed. Theresa May should condemn this leaflet and apologise to all Londoners immediately.\u201d\n\n\n\nRosindell has raised culture-based arguments before. Writing in his local newspaper at the end of last year, he described Havering as \u201ca borough that upholds our traditions in celebrating St George\u2019s day, armed forces day and proudly flies the union jack from our town hall 365 days of the year\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe choice for the people of Havering in next year\u2019s town hall elections is whether we want to keep what we have and retain the special character of Havering or allow ourselves to become just another lump of Sadiq Khan\u2019s inner London.\u201d\n\nRosindell said he rejected the idea of any bias, saying the leaflet did not mention race and was only seeking to raise awareness of high-density building projects that could take place under a Labour-run council.\n\n\n\n\u201cHavering is a very happy community with almost no racial tensions,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Labour are attempting to deliberately misinterpret campaigns against the mayor\u2019s policies on closing police stations and high-density building as a race issue then they should be ashamed in doing so.\n\n\u201cHavering is not inner London and his policies should reflect the needs of outer London areas too, but he neglects areas like Havering.\u201d\n\nOther Labour MPs have been angered by the approach adopted by some Conservatives towards Khan. \n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Nadine Dorries, the Conservative MP, quoted a tweet by the mayor calling for action on hate speech, saying: \u201cHow about, \u2018it\u2019s time to act on sex abusing grooming gangs,\u2019 instead?\u201d adding tags related to the abuse scandals in Telford and Rotherham.\n\nThis prompted Wes Streeting, the Labour MP for Ilford North, to accuse Dorries of expressing \u201cthinly veiled prejudice\u201d.\n\nLate last year, Conservative councillors in another outer London borough, Barnet, discussed a motion describing Khan as \u201can enemy of the people of Barnet\u201d.\n\nArjun Mittra, a Labour member of the council, condemned the term as \u201cdeeply historically loaded\u201d and reminiscent of Goldsmith\u2019s campaign.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Carole Cadwalladr Marc Silver Mustafa Khalili Charlie Phillips Ash Jenkins Jess Search Sandra Whipham Oliver Rivers", "body": "Shahmir Sanni, who worked for the official Vote Leave campaign, today breaks cover to raise concerns that the group behind the knife-edge 2016 vote in favour of Brexit \u2013 including key figures now working for Theresa May in Downing Street \u2013 may have broken the law by flouting referendum spending rules and then attempting to destroy evidence.\n\nSanni claims that a donation of \u00a3625,000 was made by Vote Leave to an independent referendum campaign organisation called BeLeave.

It is a grotesquely under-reported national scandal, lost amid a hysterical Tory campaign to delegitimise the Labour party with false allegations of treason. If Labour had received \u00a3820,000 from Russian-linked oligarchs and companies in the past 20 months \u2013 and indeed \u00a33m since 2010 \u2013 the media outrage would be deafening. But this is the Tory party, so there are no cries of treachery, of being in league with a hostile foreign power, of threatening the nation\u2019s security.\n\nWhen questioned about the Tories\u2019 Russian cash, our chancellor, Philip Hammond, pointedly refused to return the money. \u201cThere are people in this country who are British citizens, who are of Russian origin,\u201d he protested. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should taint them, or should tar them, with Putin\u2019s brush.\u201d How noble: a Tory who finally takes on the demonising of migrants. Before we get out the bunting, though, let\u2019s look at one donation as an example. It was 2014, and Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of Russia\u2019s former deputy finance minister, paid the princely sum of \u00a3160,000 to play tennis with David Cameron and Boris Johnson. In total, since 2012 \u2013 when the Electoral Commission initially declared her an \u201cimpermissible donor\u201d, before subsequently allowing her to donate \u2013 she has handed the Tories \u00a3514,000.\n\nI put it to you gently that if Labour took half a million pounds from the wife of a former Cuban minister, there would be no debate about whether this represented a scandalous financial relationship with the Cuban regime. Other examples include \u00a3400,000 from G\u00e9rard Lopez, a businessmen on the board of a company that partnered with Russia banks that had sanctions imposed on them during the Ukraine crisis.\n\nIt goes further than that. By last October, Tory MPs had taken four times more money from Russia\u2019s state-run Russia Today TV channel than Labour MPs: it is welcome that the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has said that his colleagues should no longer appear on the channel. The Conservative party is notoriously dependent on donations from the financial sector. The tens of millions of pounds poured into the Tories\u2019 war chest are not offered as acts of charity and munificence.\n\nIn 2011, for example, the Financial Times reported that \u201ceven donors admit that Tory MPs\u2019 desire to cut the 50p top rate of income tax is because these rich City donors are so close to the party\u201d. This same City of London is awash with dodgy money from Russia. No wonder, then, that in 2014 a secret government document revealed plans to stop any sanctions against Russia that might damage the City. Labour has attempted to introduce legislation that could prevent certain Russian individuals entering Britain or block their assets: how mysterious, then, that the Tories blocked it for \u201ctechnical reasons\u201d.\n\nThen there are the links to other regimes that combine contempt for human rights with a threat to our national security. Take Saudi Arabia, ruled by a totalitarian, fanatical regime that likes to slice the heads off gay men and dissidents, which treats women with what can only be described as barbarism, and which exports international extremism. In the two years or so after it began bombing Yemen \u2013 including with British weapons \u2013 Tory MPs received \u00a399,396 from the Saudi regime in the form of gifts, travel expenses and consultancy fees. Hammond was one of them: he received a watch worth nearly two grand from the Saudi ambassador.\n\nIn the past five years, moreover, Saudi Arabia and other autocracies spent \u00a3700,000 on luxury trips for MPs, more than 80% of whom were Tories. Just under \u00a3200,000 of that was money from Saudi Arabia to pay for the excursions of 41 MPs, 40 of whom were Conservatives. Now why would they possibly be doing that? Could it be \u2013 given that MPs receive nothing from our democratic allies for such trips \u2013 that this is part of a clear PR offensive, an attempt to secure influence over the Conservative government?\n\nIndeed, Rehman Chishti \u2013 the newly appointed vice-chair of the Conservative party \u2013 received \u00a32,000 a month from the Riyadh-based King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies between March 2016 and January 2018. Although the parliamentary commissioner for standards saw no reason to take action, it is worth noting his rampant pro-Saudi dictatorship sympathies. His Twitter feed includes boasting of being congratulated by the Saudi dictator for being re-elected as an MP in 2015, hosting lectures by Saudi officials, and leading Tory parliamentary delegations to Saudi Arabia. His colleague, Daniel Kawczynski, goes on TV to justify the barbaric Saudi assault on Yemen, crows about writing the \u201cmost pro-Saudi book ever written by a British politician\u201d, but then threatened to sue when this was linked with a trip worth \u00a36,722.14 paid for by the Saudi regime.\n\nAnd then there is the Tories\u2019 financial heart. The Qatari dictatorship owns three times more property in London than the Queen, and more than the mayoralty. Indeed, the Qatar Investment Authority owns Canary Wharf, the Shard and Harrods. Let\u2019s be clear: the Qatari regime has backed extremist and terrorist organisations, as have wealthy individuals under its jurisdiction. As Paddy Ashdown put it in November 2015, David Cameron failed to put sufficient pressure on Qatar and Saudi Arabia to stop funding extremism, leading Ashdown to \u201cworry about the closeness between the Conservative party and rich Arab Gulf individuals\u201d. Consider Theresa May\u2019s refusal to publish a report on foreign funding of extremism. Well, it would hardly go down well with the Gulf states, which are so deeply embedded in Tory milieus, would it?\n\nWhat a farce. We had rolling daily coverage smearing Jeremy Corbyn as a traitor based on the testimonies of a single crank from the former Czechoslovakia. And yet the Tories are at the centre of a web spun by the Russian and Gulf regimes. Hundreds of diners in Salisbury are now washing their belongings after traces of a nerve agent was found at Zizzi restaurant, suspected to be the location where a Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned.

solitary letters censors feared might be used to attack Beijing\u2019s controversial decision to abolish constitutional term limits for China\u2019s president.\n\nThe Communist party has painted the move - which experts say paves the way for Xi to become a dictator for life - as an expression of overwhelming popular support for China\u2019s strongman leader. However, there has been widespread online push-back in China since it was announced on Sunday on the eve of an annual political congress in Beijing.\n\nIn a blog post, Victor Mair, a University of Pennsylvania China expert, said censors had taken \u201cquick, drastic action\u201d after \u201cthe internet was flooded with complaints\u201d.\n\nAccording to a list compiled by the China Digital Times website, search terms blocked on Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter, included:\n\n- \u2018Ten thousand years\u2019 (\u4e07\u5c81), which is China\u2019s way of saying: \u2018Long live!\u2019 or \u2018Viva!\u2019\n\n- \u2018Xi Zedong\u2019 (\u4e60\u6cfd\u4e1c) - a hybrid of the names of Xi and Chairman Mao Zedong\n\n\n\nThe name Yuan Shikai, a Qing dynasty warlord who unsuccessfully tried to restore monarch to China, was also banned as were the titles of two George Orwell books, 1984 and Animal Farm. \n\n\n\nLess clear is why censors took issue with the letter \u2018N\u2019. Mair speculated it was \u201cprobably out of fear on the part of the government that \u2018N\u2019 = \u2018n terms in office\u2019, where possibly n > 2\u201d.\n\nCharlie Smith, the alias of the founder of GreatFire.org, a group which helps users track and bypass Chinese censorship, said he found that explanation plausible.\n\n\u201c[Censors] probably determined it was sensitive and then moved to add that content to the blacklist so others would not be able to post something similar,\u201d he said, noting that the seditious symbol had now been emancipated.\n\n\u201cI doubt that they actually put that much thought into it so sadly, the letter \u2018N\u2019 was a temporary victim of this rash decision.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Beijing accused the west of reacting \u201chysterically\u201d to the scrapping of presidential term limits.\n\n\u201cNo sooner had [the party] made public its proposal \u2026 than the Western media began bad-mouthing China in their usual and various ways, the party-run Global Times tabloid said in an editorial.\n\n\u201cIt is worth noting that for some time the Western media have been growing strident in their abuse of Beijing, almost using curse words,\u201d the newspaper added, claiming those behind the criticism hoped to see \u201cChina crumble\u201d. \n\n\n\nSmith said he believed Beijing had underestimated the outrage its decision would cause. \u201cThe response from Chinese netizens indicates that Xi may have miscalculated how this would be received by the general public.

One senator on the panel said he had lost confidence in the director, although the White House indicated its support for a man who has been one of Barack Obama\u2019s most trusted security aides.\n\nCIA spokesman Dean Boyd acknowledged that agency staff had improperly monitored the computers of committee staff members, who were using a network the agency had set up, called RDINet. \u201cSome CIA employees acted in a manner inconsistent with the common understanding reached between [the committee] and the CIA in 2009 regarding access to the RDINet,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if Brennan had or would offer his resignation, a different CIA spokesman, Ryan Trapani, replied: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nIn March, the committee chairwoman, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, accused the agency of violating constitutional boundaries by spying on the Senate.\n\nFeinstein said the vindication, from CIA inspector general David Buckley, and Brennan\u2019s apology were \u201cpositive first steps,\u201d suggesting that the director had further work to do before she would consider the matter closed.\n\nShe stopped short of calling for Brennan\u2019s resignation. But her committee colleague, Democrat Mark Udall of Colorado, said Brennan should go. \u201cI have no choice but to call for the resignation of CIA director John Brennan,\u201d Udall said after a briefing on the inspector general\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cThe CIA unconstitutionally spied on Congress by hacking into Senate intelligence committee computers. This grave misconduct is not only illegal, but it violates the US constitution\u2019s requirement of separation of powers. These offenses, along with other errors in judgment by some at the CIA, demonstrate a tremendous failure of leadership, and there must be consequences.\n\nBoyd, the CIA spokesman, said Brennan has asked a former committee member, Evan Bayh, a former Indiana Democratic senator, to lead an \u201caccountability board\u201d reviewing Buckley\u2019s report and to advise Brennan on next steps.\n\n\n\nThat advice, Boyd said, \u201ccould include potential disciplinary measures and/or steps to address systemic issues.\u201d\n\nSteve Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists, a longtime observer of the CIA, called its Thursday statement a \u201cconciliatory gesture\u201d to the committee\u2019s leaders. \u201cIf Senator Feinstein is satisfied with the apology then the affair is effectively over. If she contends there was a fundamental breach that cannot be corrected with a mere apology then some further action might be needed,\u201d Aftergood said.\n\nMcClatchy first reported the apology on Thursday.\n\nFeinstein, in her dramatic speech on the Senate floor in March, said the agency breached the firewall to obstruct the committee\u2019s investigation of the agency\u2019s torture of post-9/11 terrorism detainees, a years-long effort expected to be partially declassified in the coming days or weeks. That investigation was itself prompted by a different coverup: the destruction of videotapes of brutal interrogations by a senior official, Jose Rodriguez.\n\nDespite that, the committee has concluded that the torture was an ineffective means of gathering intelligence on al-Qaida \u2013 contradicting years of CIA assurances it was crucial \u2013 and that the agency lied to its overseers about its value.\n\nBrennan, a confidante of Barack Obama and a senior agency official when the \u201crendition, detention and interrogation\u201d program was established, immediately denied that his officials had spied on their overseers.\n\n\u201cAs far as the allegations of, you know, CIA hacking into, you know, Senate computers, nothing could be further from the truth. I mean we wouldn\u2019t do that. I mean, that\u2019s just beyond the \u2013 you know, the scope of reason in terms of what we would do,\u201d Brennan said on the day of Feinstein\u2019s accusation.\n\n\u201cIf I did something wrong,\u201d Brennan continued in March, \u201cI will go to the president, and I will explain to him exactly what I did, and what the findings were. And he is the one who can ask me to stay or to go.\u201d\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest credited Brennan with \u201cproactive leadership\u201d for appointing the Bayh-led board, an indication that Obama is not abandoning the man who, until March 2013, was his most senior counterterrorism aide.\n\nAccording to an unclassified summary of the CIA inspector general\u2019s findings released late on Thursday, two agency attorneys and three technical staff members \u201cimproperly accessed or caused access\u201d to the firewalled portions of the network that the committee staffers used. None was named. The three technicians \u201cdemonstrated a lack of candor about their activities during interviews.\u201d\n\nAmong other measures, the agency officials \u201cconducted a keyword search of all and and a review of some of the emails\u201d that committee staffers sent over the CIA-established network. Brennan was said not to know of the action, which occurred after he ordered an end to the surreptitious monitoring.\n\nThe inspector general additionally found that a CIA claim that the committee staff improperly accessed certain agency data on the network was the result of \u201cinaccurate information.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration has walked a delicate line over the torture report. Obama has insisted its prompt and thorough declassification \u2013 which has taken nearly four months \u2013 is a priority. Yet he appointed the CIA itself as the lead agency to determine what aspects of a report directly implicating CIA activities the public can see.\n\nEven before he was sworn in, Obama disappointed civil-liberties supporters by indicating his disinclination to prosecuting agency and ex-Bush administration officials who ordered and implemented the torture program. In 2012, a special prosecutor ended an inquiry without bringing charges. Only one man, a former CIA contractor named David Passaro, has gone to jail in connection to the CIA\u2019s post-9/11 torture.\n\nBrennan\u2019s apology also complicates a developing CIA pushback against a report that agency officials, current and former, consider shoddy. George Tenet, the former director whom Brennan served and who oversaw the brutal practices \u2013 where suspected terrorists were subjected to simulated drowning, had guns fired by their heads, were kept in undisclosed prisons for years and were sent to countries like Gadhafi\u2019s Libya and Assad\u2019s Syria for even more abusive treatment \u2013 is said to be developing a public strategy to attack the committee once the report is released.\n\nThe agency, consistent with a pattern that has held since 9/11, appears out of danger from criminal liability.

While the 2015 agreement with Iran was being negotiated, he wrote a piece decrying the whole exercise in the New York Times. That was headlined: \u201cTo Stop Iran\u2019s Bomb, Bomb Iran.\u201d\n\nBolton has repeated these lines repeatedly on television, and Trump is widely reported to have chosen him because of his on-screen performances (despite initial reservations about his moustache, apparently). So the implication is that the president is well aware of his policy prescriptions.\n\nHe does not have to seek Senate confirmation for the White House post, which is just as well for Bolton. The last time the Senate was asked to confirm him, under the George W Bush administration, it refused on the grounds he was too extreme.\n\nTraditionally, the national security adviser convenes and chairs internal policy debates but Bolton\u2019s record suggests that a moderating role is not his style. At the state department, he doggedly pushed the bogus evidence of Saddam Hussein\u2019s weapons of mass destruction in the run-up to the Iraq invasion, and when the department\u2019s own intelligence bureau expressed scepticism, Bolton had its officials excluded from meetings.\n\nEverything we know about Bolton\u2019s past suggests he is coming to the White House to drive policy, not to broker it. That calls into question the continuing influence of James Mattis, the defence secretary, the last survivor from the group of moderating voices on foreign policy, the \u201cadults in the room\u201d. Rex Tillerson, gave his last goodbye speech as secretary of state on Thursday and will be formally gone by the end of the month, to be replaced by the far more hawkish and loyal CIA director, Mike Pompeo.\n\nBolton takes over from HR McMaster early next month, which means that Trump will go forward with a new and bellicose team into two of the most consequential decisions of his presidency.\n\nIf Trump does not sign the next sanctions waiver on Iran in mid-May, the US will be in violation of the 2015 agreement, quite possibly triggering a new crisis in the Gulf, and opening a rift in relations with European allies. McMaster and Tillerson had both urged him sign the waivers for that reason. Bolton, by contrast, has spent the past three years urging the destruction of the nuclear deal.\n\nBolton will also be at Trump\u2019s side when he heads for his planned summit with Kim Jong-un, and his presence will inevitably colour that critical encounter. Bolton, a former lawyer who like Trump avoided going to Vietnam, has advocated three different military options against North Korea: against nuclear facilities, bringing down a missile test, or an assassination of Kim Jong-un.\n\nBolton has acknowledged the likely devastating North Korean reprisals against South Korean civilians but has argued \u201cno foreign government, even a close ally, can veto an action to protect Americans from Kim Jong-un\u2019s nuclear weapons\u201d.\n\nThe conventional wisdom about Bolton was that he would not be a natural choice for Trump as he was hawkish on all fronts, including Russia. However, he has shown himself quite flexible when it comes to Trump\u2019s relations with the Kremlin, playing down the significance of the president\u2019s congratulation of Putin for his election victory, and he has suggested that the hacking of the Democratic party\u2019s emails (said by US intelligence to have been carried out by Russian operatives) could have been a false-flag operation by the Obama administration.\n\nFor a president looking to distract attention away from the investigation into his campaign and its Moscow links, by seeking confrontation on the world stage, Bolton may be the perfect fit.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Jessica Elgot Political Correspondent", "body": "MPs have summoned Mark Zuckerberg to appear before a select committee investigating fake news and accused his company of misleading them at a previous hearing.\n\n\n\nThe Facebook founder has been called to give evidence to the digital, culture, media and sport committee, following revelations over the use of its data by the election consultancy Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\n\nIn a letter to Zuckerberg, the committee\u2019s chair, Damian Collins, wrote that Facebook had been repeatedly asked about how companies acquired and held on to user data from its site, and whether data had been taken without users\u2019 consent.\n\n\u201cYour officials\u2019 answers have consistently understated this risk, and have been misleading to the committee,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cIt is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process ...

Two men loading the van declined to comment when asked if they worked for the company.\n\nMeanwhile, Collins said it was extraordinary that Facebook\u2019s investigators had been in the CA office and questioned their motives.\n\n\u201cWe were told this last night and I don\u2019t think the information commissioner was aware of that at that time,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThis is a matter for the authorities. Facebook sent in data analysts and lawyers who they appointed; what they intended to do there, who knows?\n\n\u201cThe concern would have been, were they removing information or evidence which could have been vital to the investigation? It\u2019s right they stood down but it\u2019s astonishing they were there in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe Channel 4 News investigation, broadcast on Monday, comes two days after the Observer reported Cambridge Analytica had gained unauthorised access to tens of millions of Facebook profiles in one of the social media company\u2019s biggest data breaches.\n\nOn Monday, Cambridge Analytica\u2019s chief executive, Alexander Nix, said the media attacks were because of his firm\u2019s role in the successful presidential election campaign of Donald Trump.\n\nNix, one of the CA executives targeted by the undercover Channel 4 reporters, suggested he could use women to entrap politicians on behalf of their rivals.\n\n\u201cDeep digging is interesting, but you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that\u2019s too good to be true, and make sure that that\u2019s video recorded. You know, these sorts of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption, putting it on the internet, these sorts of things,\u201d he was recorded saying.\n\nNix said they could \u201csend some girls around to the candidate\u2019s house\u201d, adding that Ukrainian girls \u201care very beautiful, I find that works very well\u201d, Channel 4 reported.\n\nNix told BBC\u2019s Newsnight the sting was \u201ca coordinated attack by the media that\u2019s been going on for very, very many months\u201d. He added, however, that he had a \u201chuge amount of regrets about the fact that we, maybe, undertook this meeting and spoke with a certain amount of hyperbole about some of the things that we do\u201d. \n\n\n\nCollins said on Tuesday that MPs would examine whether they felt Nix had misled parliament when he answered their questions during the committee\u2019s investigation into fake news. \n\n\n\n\u201cOn the face of it, it looks like Mr Nix misled parliament.

At a ceremony last November at the headquarters of the world body responsible for the elimination of chemical weapons in The Hague, a plaque was unveiled to commemorate the destruction of the last of Russia\u2019s stockpiles.\n\n\n\nGeneral Ahmet \u00dcz\u00fcmc\u00fc, the director general of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which works closely with the UN, was fulsome in his praise. \u201cThis is a major achievement,\u201d he said. The 192-member body had seemingly overseen and verified the destruction Russia\u2019s entire stock of chemical weapons, all 39,967 metric tons.\n\nThe question now is whether all of Russia\u2019s chemical weapons were destroyed and accounted for. Theresa May \u2013 having identified the nerve agent used in the Salisbury attack as novichok, developed in Russia \u2013 told the Commons on Wednesday that Russia had offered no explanation as to why it had \u201can undeclared chemical weapons programme in contravention of international law\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn introduced a sceptical note, questioning whether there was any evidence as to the location of its production.\n\nThe exchanges provoked a debate echoing the one that preceded the 2003 invasion of Iraq over whether UN weapons inspectors had overseen the destruction of all the weapons of mass destruction in the country or whether Saddam Hussein had retained secret hidden caches.\n\nOn social media, there were arguments that the novichok could have come from some part of the former Soviet Union other than Russia, such as Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan or Ukraine, or some non-state group, maybe criminals.\n\nThe years following the fall of the Berlin Wall were chaotic, with chemical weapons laboratories and storage sites across the Soviet Union abandoned by staff who were no longer being paid. Security was almost non-existent, leaving the sites at the mercy of criminal gangs or disenchanted staff looking to supplement their income.\n\n\u201cCould somebody have smuggled something out?\u201d Amy Smithson, a US-based biological and chemical weapons expert, said to Reuters. \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t rule that possibility out, especially a small amount and particularly in view of how lax the security was at Russian chemical facilities in the early 1990s.\u201d\n\nIt took almost a decade before order was restored, in part through stockpiles being transferred to Russia from other parts of the former Soviet Union and in part through help from US and other western experts.\n\nNovichok was developed at a laboratory complex in Shikhany, in central Russia, according to a British weapons expert, Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, and a Russian chemist involved in the chemical weapons programme, Vil Mirzayanov, who later defected to the US. Mirzayanov said the novichok was tested at Nukus, in Uzbekistan.\n\nThe former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, who visited the site at Nukus, said it had been dismantled with US help. He is among those advocating scepticism about the UK placing blame on Russia.\n\nIn a blog post, he wrote: \u201cThe same people who assured you Saddam Hussein had WMDs now assure you Russian \u2018novichok\u2019 nerve agents are being wielded by Vladimir Putin to attack people on British soil.\u201d\n\nA Russian lawyer, Boris Kuznetsov, told Reuters he was offering to pass to the British authorities a file he said might be relevant to the Salisbury case. It details an incident when poison hidden in a phone receiver killed a Russian banker and his secretary in 1995. The poison came from an employee at the state chemical facility who sold it through intermediaries - in an ampule placed in a presentation case - to help reduce his debts.\n\nThe UK government case rests not just on its argument that novichok was developed in Russia, but what it says is past form, a record of Russian state-sponsored assassination of former spies.\n\n\n\nMurray, in a phone interview, is undeterred, determined to challenge the government line, in spite of having been subjected to a level of abuse on social media he had not experienced before.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence it was Russia. I am not ruling out that it could be Russia, though I don\u2019t see the motive.

Like Britain\u2019s courageous International Brigades eight decades earlier, Norton risked his life to fight Isis alongside Kurdish freedom fighters in Kurdish Syria. As you read this, a secular democracy which celebrates women\u2019s rights is under attack, including by Turkish-aligned troops who have sung al-Qaida songs and threatened to cut off the heads of their \u201catheist\u201d victims. If you\u2019re wondering why Kurds and their supporters occupied King\u2019s Cross and Manchester Piccadilly stations last weekend: here\u2019s why. The Conservative government is arming to the teeth a nation ruled by an authoritarian despot, whose regime is linked to extreme jihadist groups, and which is now attempting to liquidate one of the only islands of democracy in a sea of Middle Eastern despotism: and yet virtually no one is speaking out about it.\n\nHundreds of thousands of civilians \u2013 many of whom are refugees who have fled the barbarity of Syria\u2019s civil war \u2013 currently live under siege. Ever since Turkey launched a military offensive with the Orwellian codename Operation Olive Branch, around 230 civilians have died. But this isn\u2019t just about the threat to civilian life. 26-year-old Elif Sarican \u2013 an activist with the Kurdish Women\u2019s Movement \u2013 struggles to speak to me: her voice is hoarse through protesting. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand the attack of the Turkish army, with its allied jihadist forces, is not just against the Kurdish people,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThese are two systems at war.\u201d\n\nConsider the nature of the two sides in this onslaught. The self-described Democratic Federation of North Syria, known as Rojava, is a remarkable experiment: of direct democracy and a gender revolution. \u201cEssentially, in the birthplace of patriarchy, women are liberating themselves,\u201d Sarican tells me. Most striking are the women soldiers who have fearlessly fought Isis fighters. \u201cOne of the first things I noticed was that women soldiers were incredibly equal and assertive,\u201d says Norton, the first Briton to sign up because of their socialist convictions. \u201cThey\u2019re not afraid to come up to you and say \u2018take your gun off\u2019, or argue with you. They\u2019re not physically nervous around men which you immediately notice: different, not just in their society, but in our own.\u201d\n\nThere are democratic assemblies ranging from the neighbourhood level to cantons: quotas are enforced to ensure representation for women, as well as for ethnic minorities. Democratic involvement is deemed mandatory. One of Norton\u2019s jobs in the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) was to go from house to house to ask citizens to attend commune meetings and offer lifts. Women-only meetings drew up a new social contract for Rojava: banning marriage under a certain age, proscribing polygamy, making domestic violence a specific offence. When any woman says their husbands forbid them from attending meetings, a group of women will instead descend on their home, leaving him with little choice. \u201cThis a huge social revolution,\u201d says Paula Lamont, the Kurdish Solidarity Campaign\u2019s co-chair. \u201cAttitudes to gay rights and women\u2019s rights have been totally changed in a matter of years.\u201d If a town of 50,000 had even one synagogue attended by just 15 Jews, Jewish representation is guaranteed on the assemblies. Every poster is translated, almost obsessively, into every language of every minority, however few belong to it. \u201cI saw a real workers\u2019 revolution,\u201d Norton tells me: one where socialism, feminism and even environmentalism were synthesised.\n\nConsider our noble friend and ally Turkey, on the other hand. Turkey\u2019s regime locks up more journalists than any other government on earth. Since an abortive coup, tens of thousands of Turks have been detained or sacked on political grounds. It is a regime with a history of sordid links with jihadist extremists. It once backed the al-Nusra Front, which is al-Qaida by another name; and backs Ahrar al-Sham, an extreme jihadist group. Isis was allowed to expand because, for many years, Turkey allowed its murderous zealots to cross the porous border into Syria. There is evidence of oil smuggled by Isis with Turkish buyers as their main clients, and relationships between Turkish officials and Isis officers. Isis commanders have been treated in Turkey\u2019s hospitals.\n\nThe evidence is even more damning than that. One former Isis soldier has told the journalist Patrick Cockburn that \u201cmost of those who are fighting in Afrin against the YPG are Isis, though Turkey has trained them to change their assault tactics.\u201d In any case, the relationship between Turkey and fanatical extremists is undeniable. Yes, there have been repeated terrorist attacks against Turkey by a group of fanatics the regime is partly responsible for fuelling: but note they have repeatedly targeted Kurds, like the town of Suruc \u2013 just across the Turkish border \u2013 where 33 Kurdish socialists were killed in July 2015; or when 109 died in a bomb attack on a pro-Kurdish peace rally in Ankara in October 2015.\n\nWhat is our own government\u2019s response? On her second major foreign visit after becoming prime minister, Theresa May signed a deal worth \u00a3100m to develop Turkish fighter jets. This is utterly scandalous. Given the Labour leadership is routinely called a threat to both national security and democratic values, why is it permissible for the Tories to arm to the teeth a jihadist-linked foreign government intent on snuffing out a beleaguered democracy?\n\nThere is a challenge to the left, too. We rightly condemn the injustice inflicted on the Palestinian people as they language under the occupation of a western-backed state. Where is the equal outrage over the assault against democratic socialist Rojave? Our own government \u2013 complicit in this unforgivable bloodshed \u2013 must be pressured to cease arms sales to Turkey and to exert diplomatic pressure. The same goes for Saudi Arabia: after all, it is that repulsive regime which exports Wahhabi and Salafist extremism to the Middle East and beyond. Rojave, too, must be officially recognised, and have a seat at the table in any resolution of Syria\u2019s protracted horror.\n\nAlexander Norton is right. This is our Spain. Extremist authoritarians who despise democracy, women and freedom are at war with what should be an international beacon, a society which offers an example far beyond the despot-afflicted Middle East. Turkey knows that Rojava\u2019s success will inspire not just its own Kurdish population to assert its rights: it sees a system which threatens its own degenerate authoritarian order. British Kurds are occupying train stations and roads because no-one will listen to them about one of the gravest injustices on earth.

In Cambridgeshire, for example, the average \u201cprompt\u201d response time was 15 hours. This could include cases of serious assault, including sexual violence, inspectors said.\n\nThe inspectorate put the delays down to a lack of police officers available to attend the emergencies, ruling out a problem with the call handlers.\n\nLabour said the findings showed that cuts to police budgets had left the service at breaking point, while the minister for policing pointed out inspectors found most forces to be effective at keeping people safe.\n\nZo\u00eb Billingham, Her Majesty\u2019s Inspector of Constabulary, who led the inspection, said she had \u201cmajor concerns that policing is under significant stress\u201d.\n\nShe said: \u201cOn occasions, that stress stretches some forces to such an extent that they risk being unable to keep people safe in some very important areas of policing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout a quarter of forces are all too often overwhelmed by the demand they face, resulting in worrying backlogs of emergency jobs, with officers not attending incidents promptly, including those involving vulnerable people.\u201d\n\nPolice budgets have fallen by around a fifth since 2010 and HMICFRS recently said forces will have \u00a3700m less a year to fight crime in the coming years, as well as fewer officers.\n\nEarlier this week, Theresa May was officially rebuked by the UK Statistics Authority for misleading MPs and the public over false claims that the government was providing an extra \u00a3450m in funding to local police forces in 2018/19.\n\nLouise Haigh, the shadow policing and crime minister, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had all the Tory spin on police funding, but this week we are finally getting to the truth.\n\n\u201cFirst the stats watchdog raps the prime minister for misleading claims and now the independent inspector is sounding the alarm \u2013 warning that some forces are so stretched that the lives of vulnerable people are being put at risk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time the Tories owned up to the public because their cuts have left our police at breaking point and our communities at risk.\u201d\n\nAs well as struggling to respond to emergency calls, HMICFRS found police officers were not seizing opportunities to look for evidence in the initial stages of the investigation.\n\n\n\nIn too many cases, so-called \u201cgolden hour\u201d responsibilities were not being carried out, the watchdog said. House-to-house enquires, identifying witnesses and use of body-worn cameras were being overlooked.\n\nIn addition, a review of 2,700 crime case files revealed more than 50% of opportunities to identify an offender were missed and on a quarter of occasions house-to-house enquiries in search of witnesses were not made.\n\nThe watchdog also found police forces with high workloads and \u201cpoor supervision\u201d are yet to risk assess 3,300 registered sex offenders, an 18% increase on last year.\n\nAs of July last year, there were 60,061 \u201cwanted records\u201d on the police national computer \u2013 including 374 relating to homicide and 1,135 to rape, the report said.\n\nAnd it highlighted the ongoing \u201cnational crisis\u201d in the shortage of detectives. There is currently a shortfall of 5,000 investigators across England and Wales, meaning one in five detective desks are empty, the report said.\n\nThe report added: \u201cHMICFRS is concerned by this finding, because it shows that the system is under severe strain and in some forces the cracks are showing.\u201d\n\nOverall one force was rated \u201coutstanding\u201d, 30 were \u201cgood\u201d and 12 judged to \u201crequire improvement\u201d.\n\nNick Hurd, the minister for policing and the fire service, said: \u201cThe government recognises that crime is changing and demand increasing, which is why we have provided a strong and comprehensive settlement that will increase funding by up to \u00a3450m across the police system for 2018/19, including \u00a3270m drawn from increased precept contributions.\n\n\u201cThe government has given police new powers to protect vulnerable people, including domestic violence protection orders and new offences under the Modern Slavery Act, and progress has been made in this area.

Even after the transition period is over, exporters will still meet EU standards because they will want to trade with the continent, and farmers and the protesting fishermen will have to cut a deal if they want to sell their produce.\u00a0As for immigration, business and the public sector will tell the government that every enterprise from care homes to restaurant chains will collapse if it closes the borders.\n\nI don\u2019t want to lay the flattery on with a trowel but Jacob Rees-Mogg isn\u2019t always the drivel-spouting dullard he appears. When he says Britain risks becoming a \u201cvassal state\u201d of the EU after 2019 he\u2019s right, but he cannot draw the obvious conclusion that we shouldn\u2019t leave. Nor can millions of others because of a failure by progressive opinion to argue respectfully with them.\n\nFor some, the failure is an act of policy. A faction among Labour MPs and commentators announces they are respecting the voters\u2019 wishes, even though they realise leaving the single market will harm the poorest parts of Britain. (They then stand back as if expecting a round of applause for their bravery.) The rightwing press makes too much of them, but there are undoubtedly also liberals who think supporters of Brexit are just stupid racists, and there is no point arguing with them.\n\nIn any political battle, you should always ask how far you can compromise without selling your soul. The right cannot be stopped now or in future unless a portion of its supporters are offered reasons to change their minds. Few are forthcoming from the liberal-left. The dominant leftish explanation for working-class support for leave is it was a protest by the people left behind by Thatcherism. As leftists hated Thatcher, this is the worst type of self-indulgent reasoning: the argument that proves you have been right all along.\n\nThe liberal-left does not try to understand harder reasons behind Brexit and grapple with working-class patriotism, fears about immigration and political correctness, and the yearning for strong government and national security. Perhaps progressives can never assuage these passions without becoming reactionaries themselves, but they could try. If not, there should at least be a campaign to explain to leave voters how they have been deceived.\n\nHere we run into an under-discussed problem. Without the support of the official opposition, efforts to hold the right to account will be puny. That Jeremy Corbyn and the British far left are anti-EU has been of the utmost importance. They have not pounded away at the lies the left-behind were fed, and tried to provoke a class that is hugely suspicious of politicians to turn on Farage and Johnson for taking them for fools. Silence can be the most effective form of complicity. Because the Labour leadership stays silent, the Brexit right can revive, regain the trust of the men and women it shamefully misled and win the next\u00a0battle.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Anushka Asthana", "body": "Theresa May is to call on the Conservative party to face up to the \u201cpolitical fact\u201d that people distrust its motivations around vital public services such as the NHS and education.\n\nIn a speech that has echoes her infamous \u201cnasty party\u201d warning 16 years ago, the prime minister will say hospitals and schools are facing difficulties that the government must show it is trying to tackle.\n\n\u201cWhile always defending our record in office, we also need to accept that our public services today do face real challenges and we must be clear about the action we are taking to help them,\u201d she will tell the Tories\u2019 spring conference in central London.\n\nHer comments are likely to raise the hopes of MPs who have been calling on ministers to boost NHS spending through new tax rises, with changes expected in the autumn budget.\n\nMay will say that Tory councils have kept taxes low while delivering high quality services to those most in need and will stress the importance of Brexit.\n\nBut, using language similar to the 2002 landmark speech when May, then party chair, warned \u201cyou know what some people call us - the nasty party\u201d, the prime minister will focus on public services, arguing they are just as important to national life.\n\n\u201cSome people question our motives.

If you want bilateral or trade relations, it is better to do it with your money not swap. Naira is not a convertible currency in the international market, but our oil earnings are in dollars.\n\nSo, we are still in the same place, that is, sell your crude oil in dollars and buy from China in dollars. Unless we sell crude oil to them and collect their yuan, swap is not ideal,\u201d he said.\n\nA top bank chief, who would not want his name in print said the mention of \u201cswap\u201d in the discussion was the biggest diversion that would have made any deal cumbersome and a rip-off on the country, because China knows how to get a better bargain.\n\n\u201cBut I thought there would have been also talks about reducing the naira-dollar-yuan intricacies in trade between the country and Nigeria. In fact, what the United Kingdom just offered Nigeria recently is what I thought the leadership would have pressed for.\n\n\u201cIn all, the trip and the proposal were more like showing that we said something instead of not saying anything because I can\u2019t see any positive since then except borrowing from them.

But they were faster in rushing to the media and now they have failed.

Haigh said the \u201cextra \u00a3450m\u201d would only be found if police and crime commissioners pushed through an increase to council tax to raise \u00a3270m. About \u00a3130m of the \u00a3450m is to go directly to \u201cnational police priorities\u201d rather than local forces and a further \u00a350m is to be provided for counter-terrorism funding.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s claim that local police force budgets were being boosted by \u00a3450m was repeated by Home Office tweets and in a letter sent out by Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons.\n\n\u201cWe have commented in the past about statements on police funding and emphasised the need for greater precision in the way numbers are used,\u201d Norgrove told Haigh in his response to her complaint.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the particular points you make, the prime minister\u2019s statement and the Home Office\u2019s tweet could have led the public to conclude incorrectly that central government is providing an additional \u00a3450m for police spending in 2018/19.\n\n\u201cThe Home Office tweet also implied that the \u00a3450m sum is guaranteed. As the minister for policing\u2019s statement outlined, up to \u00a3270m of the funding settlement will come from local council tax, if police and crime commissioners and mayors choose to raise these sums.

In a poor and backward part of the Russian empire called Finland, more than a quarter of a million people \u2013 nearly 10% of the population \u2013 starved to death.\n\nLast year, on the centenary of its independence, Finland was ranked, by assorted international indices, the most stable, the safest and the best-governed country in the world. It was also the third wealthiest, the third least corrupt, the second most socially progressive and the third most socially just.\n\nFinland\u2019s judicial system is the most independent in the world, its police the most trusted, its banks the soundest, its companies the second most ethical, its elections the second freest, and its citizens enjoy the highest levels of personal freedom, choice and wellbeing.\n\nThe Nordic country\u2019s 5.5 million inhabitants are also the third most gender-equal in the world and have the fifth lowest income inequality. Their babies are the least underweight, their kids feel the most secure, and their teens perform the second best at reading (only third at science, though).\n\nIn a century and a half, they seem to have done rather well. And so, as the Guardian embarks on a new series investigating the things that are going right in the world, it feels natural to start in Helsinki.\n\n\u201cIf you look at where we were then and where we are now, I think, absolutely, you can talk about a Finnish miracle,\u201d said Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m, a Helsinki-born Nobel prize-winning economist not much given to exaggeration. \u201cHow and why did it happen? Now that\u2019s a question.\u201d\n\nThere are limits, of course, to the usefulness of this kind of exercise: no two countries \u2013 their circumstances, their histories, their people \u2013 can be the same. Learnings may not be transferrable. The magic sauce that made Finland would not produce the same results in, say, France.\n\nIt is true, too, that shown the long list of social and economic measures by which their country can only be judged a success, many Finns snort: emerging slowly from a long recession, with unemployment at 8% and a populist, nationalist party garnering up to 20% of the vote, the country\u2019s not what it was, they say. Often, the response \u2013 only semi-joking \u2013 is, \u201cYou mean other countries are worse?\u201d\n\nBut inquiring after the sauce\u2019s recipe of, among others, an economist, a philosopher, a sociologist and an ex-president, intriguing ingredients emerge.\n\nTo begin with, the geography \u2013 and its consequence, the climate. \u201cWe live,\u201d Tarja Halonen, Finland\u2019s president from 2000 to 2012, says carefully, \u201cin a cold, harsh and remote place. Every person has to work hard for themselves. But that is not always enough. You have to help your neighbours.\u201d\n\nBruce Oreck, who served as Barack Obama\u2019s ambassador to Helsinki (he liked it so much he stayed), says this has been \u201ca profound, long-term influence. It\u2019s made Finns self-reliant, private, but also dependent on a highly cooperative society, where rules matter. It\u2019s cultural, but it\u2019s become part of the chemistry.\u201d\n\nOf all the Finnish words that are hard to translate into English, the one Finns cite most is sisu: a kind of dogged, courageous persistence regardless of consequence. It is what, in 1939-40, allowed an army of 350,000 men to twice fight off Soviet forces three times their number, and inflict losses five times heavier than those they sustained.\n\nBut there is another that is, perhaps, more revealing, says Sirpa K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen, an award-winning historical novelist. Talkoo means \u201cworking together, collectively, for a specific good\u201d, she says. \u201cGetting the harvest in, stocking wood, raising money. It\u2019s about cooperating. Everyone together, equally.\u201d\n\nCooperation, but also relative equality, are recurring themes. Ruled for almost 600 years by Sweden and a further century by Russia, Finland was \u201cgenerally and democratically poor\u201d, says K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen. \u201cThere were no serfs, but no wildly wealthy aristocrats either. Society was not hierarchical.\u201d\n\nSince long before independence in 1917, says Riitta Jallinoja, a sociologist, \u201cgaps between the social classes in Finland have been smaller than usual. Even the industrial revolution here was modest: no Rothschilds, no Fords, not even a dynasty like Sweden\u2019s Wallenbergs.\u201d\n\nEven in today\u2019s clean, functional, visibly prosperous Helsinki, that still sort of holds. \u201cYou can be walking down the street next to the richest guy in town, and you really wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d says Oreck. In Finland, insists Halonen, \u201cYou don\u2019t look up at people, and you don\u2019t look down. You look level.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s most successful current firm, games studio Supercell, creator of Clash of Clans, paid over \u20ac800m in tax, producing seven of Finland\u2019s top 10 income tax payers in 2016. Along with the rest of the country\u2019s highest 10,000 or so highest earners, the amount they pay is published in an annual list, on \u201cnational envy day\u201d. Finland is big on civic duty, but also on transparency.\n\nThe success of the country\u2019s free national education system, established before independence in 1866 and regularly ranked among the world\u2019s best, also has its roots in a more egalitarian society, says Jallinoja: \u201cEducation was the key to advancement.\u201d\n\nNot only that, says the philosopher and professor emeritus Ilkka Niiniluoto, but the whole country is actually \u201ca social construction created by university professors.\u201d The academics who led the country\u2019s nationalist movement \u201ccreated Finland as a nation: its language, history, literature, music, symbols, folklore. The nationalist leader was a philosophy professor.\u201d\n\nSince independence, nearly 30% of Finland\u2019s heads of state and government have been university professors, including half its early prime ministers. \u201cThey shaped the country as we know it,\u201d says Jallinoja. \u201cBut vitally, they also created confidence in social mobility, and real belief in education. That history comes with us.\u201d\n\nIf, however, Finland has been rated the world\u2019s most literate country, it may also have something to do with a 19th-century decree that a couple could not marry in the Lutheran church before both passed a reading test. \u201cQuite an incentive,\u201d observes Halonen, \u201cto learn to read.\u201d\n\nGender equality, similarly, was baked in. In 1906, Finnish women became, if not quite the first to win the vote, the first to run for electoral office. Nearly 10% of MPs in Finland\u2019s first parliament were women (the figure is now 42%); as early as 1930, up to 30% of university students were women. \u201cWomen in Finland took their rights seriously, and men accepted it,\u201d says Halonen.\n\nOther ingredients have since added to the sauce. Finland benefited enormously from wise wartime and postwar leaders, insists Holmstr\u00f6m: \u201cThey thought about the good of the country; took big, sensible decisions. And the consensus backed them, because everyone knew we were fighting for our existence.\u201d\n\nResponsible choices were made, invariably by continuity-conscious coalition governments, on big industrial and infrastructure investments, that have paid dividends many times over. More recently, today\u2019s high-tech, startup-friendly Finland was born of record investment in research and development in the 1990s, nearing 4% of GDP.\n\nSteady growth \u2013 through war, the collapse of the Soviet Union and a deep recession in the 1990s, Finland\u2019s economy has expanded over the past century at a rate equalled only by Japan\u2019s \u2013 has bolstered trust in the nation\u2019s institutions. \u201cPeople criticise the government constantly, and often for very good reason,\u201d says K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen. \u201cBut fundamentally, they do trust it.\u201d\n\nAs they do, on the whole, their welfare state \u2013 on which Finland spends 31% of its GDP, the second highest proportion in the OECD. (\u201cIf you\u2019re going to have a welfare state,\u201d says Halonen, \u201cthe only real way to it is so well that there\u2019s no point having a private alternative.\u201d)\n\nBut Finns also trust each other more than most, says Andr\u00e9 Chaker, a Canadian-born lawyer and public speaker who has lived in the country for 25 years. Corruption and organised crime are all but nonexistent. \u201cThat feeds into the business environment,\u201d he says. \u201cThings get done here faster, more reliably.\u201d\n\nAnd it is trust that breeds confidence, and a willingness to innovate: the World Economic Forum ranks Finland the most innovative country, per capita, in the world. For years dominated by monolithic mining and forestry firms, then by the once-mighty Nokia, Finland today is close behind Silicon Valley in the number of startups per head.\n\nThe magic sauce, then, seems based mainly on basic virtues: self-confidence, cooperation, equality, respect for education, trust. At bottom and in practice, says Anu Partanen, a Finnish journalist who now lives in New York, it boils down to a different quality of relationship. She calls it \u2013 since it is shared to a greater or lesser extent by Sweden, Norway and Denmark \u2013 the Nordic theory of love.\n\n\u201cIn the family, it\u2019s realising that relationships can only really flourish between individuals \u2013 parents, children, spouses \u2013 who are equal and independent,\u201d Partanen says. \u201cIn a society, it means policy choices aimed at ensuring the greatest possible degree of independence, freedom and opportunity for everyone.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to the world\u2019s biggest problems.

In 2016 then in 2017 he was the subject of an investigation by intelligence services, \u201cwhich did not bring to light any sign that would indicate he would carry out a terrorist act\u201d.\n\nBut when entering the Super U supermarket in nearby Trebes on Friday, Lakdim shouted \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d (God is greatest), declared he was ready to die for Syria, and demanded freedom for his \u201cbrothers\u201d before shooting and killing a client and an employee.\n\nOn Friday night a massive police operation was being carried out at the Ozanam housing estate in Carcassonne where Lakdim lived, not far from the police headquarters where he shot at officers earlier.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a state of siege,\u201d one resident at the scene said by phone as heavily armed and masked officers carried out searches.\n\nFew people were willing to talk to reporters, including a relative reached by telephone who quickly hung up.\n\nThe estate has seen an increase in recent years of the kind of drug-dealing and vandalism that have blighted many poor districts across France.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been alerting the authorities for a while now, there\u2019s dealing, there are guns going around, we hear gunshots,\u201d one retired woman said.\n\nA man in his 40s said he arrived in Ozanam when he was 14 \u201cbut now, I\u2019m getting my mum out, she\u2019s had two of her cars set on fire\u201d.\n\nOthers said it was no worse than other housing estates and there had been no signs of radicalisation with Lakdim or other youths.\n\n\u201cHe wore a beard but he was just a regular kid,\u201d one neighbour said.\n\n\u201cHe came out twice a day to walk his dog; we were really surprised to learn it was him.\u201d\n\nLakdim\u2019s trajectory appears to have followed a grimly familiar pattern in France over recent years of young men progressing from petty crimes into terrorism, often despite surveillance by the authorities.\n\n\n\nSince the January 2015 massacre at the Charlie Hebdo newspaper in Paris by two men claiming allegiance to Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group, more than 240 people have been killed in jihadist attacks.\n\nAfter attacks on the Stade France and the Bataclan concert hall and nearby bars in November 2015, investigators found that the ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud and Salah Abdeslam, the only surviving commando member, had both served time for robbery around 2011.\n\nA string of deadly gun and knife attacks has followed, and the interior minister, Gerard Collomb, has said dozens of others have been thwarted by police as the government steps up anti-terror measures.\n\nIn Carcassonne itself, after months of surveillance police arrested a 22-year-old man in June 2016 on suspicion of planning to target American and Russian tourists.\n\n\u201cThe acts carried out today sadly remind us once more, tragically, that the terrorist threat level on our territory has not lessened,\u201d Molins said.\n\n\u201cNow mainly internal, it is first of all the result of radicalised individuals living in our country,\u201d he said.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "David Smith In Washington", "body": "Donald Trump has ordered the Pentagon to plan a military parade that would see soldiers marching and tanks rolling down the streets of Washington, it was reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe move was instantly criticised, with one veterans\u2019 group comparing the president to \u201ca wannabe banana republic strongman\u201d.\n\nTrump is seeking a grand parade similar to the Bastille Day celebration in Paris, according to the Washington Post. He outlined the plan at a meeting at the Pentagon on 18 January that included defense secretary Jim Mattis and joint chiefs of staff chairman General Joseph Dunford, the paper said, citing an unnamed military official.\n\n\u201cThe marching orders were: I want a parade like the one in France,\u201d the official told the Post. \u201cThis is being worked at the highest levels of the military.\u201d\n\nThe White House confirmed that an event is in the works, though it did not offer further details. \u201cPresident Trump is incredibly supportive of America\u2019s great service members who risk their lives every day to keep our country safe,\u201d press secretary Sarah Sanders said. \u201cHe has asked the Department of Defense to explore a celebration at which all Americans can show their appreciation.\u201d\n\nTrump, who did not serve in the Vietnam war after receiving five draft deferments, has long spoken of his admiration for tough military figures such as General George Patton and frequently makes reference to \u201cmy generals\u201d.\n\nThe president was deeply impressed by a parade in Paris on 14 July last year. American and French soldiers marched together on the Avenue des Champs-Elysees to mark the centenary of America\u2019s entry into the first world war and France\u2019s annual Bastille Day holiday. It included tanks, armoured vehicles and a flyover of US and French military jets.\n\nTrump told reporters in September: \u201cTo a large extent because of what I witnessed, we may do something like that on the Fourth of July in Washington down Pennsylvania Avenue. We\u2019re actually looking into it.\u201d\n\nBut not for the first time in Trump\u2019s short political career, such a display is likely to prove divisive.

It was a shift that would change his life and launch a national campaign.\n\n\n\nWhen he arrived at the Travis air force base in Fairfield, California, military police called Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) after seeing his California driver\u2019s license indicated his undocumented status. Ice also detained a second worker, Rodrigo N\u00fa\u00f1ez.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy life just changed in only five or 10 minutes. I felt like I lost everything,\u201d the father of three told the Guardian.\n\nTwo weeks later when his wife came to visit him in an immigration detention center, much to his amazement, he learned that his union, the Painters Union Local 82, was hiring a lawyer to represent him.\n\n\n\n\u201cI just thought that I was a member of the union for work and so I could get insurance for my kids. I never thought that my union would help me in a case like this. It was amazing,\u201d said Mej\u00eda Murgu\u00eda. \n\n\n\nUnder the banner #FreeHugo, his union went all out on his behalf, holding rallies around the country to stop his deportation.\n\n\n\nThe pressure was intense. \u201cA couple times I tried to quit. It was just so hard to stay far from my family. It was hard when they came to visit me because of the glass when I saw them crying and I couldn\u2019t touch them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they gave me letters and this support, that got me excited and I didn\u2019t feel so alone about my case.\u201d\n\n\n\nFinally, on 22 November, after 204 days in detention, he was released as a result of his union\u2019s activism in public and in court, winning a stay on political asylum grounds.\n\n\n\nRodrigo N\u00fa\u00f1ez was less fortunate and was deported back to Mexico.\n\nTheir different fates highlight a split in the union movement and its attitude to undocumented workers who are increasingly running into difficulties under the Trump administration.\n\nN\u00fa\u00f1ez\u2019s union, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, did not defend him. While the Painters Union has chosen to embrace their increasingly immigrant workforce over the last few decades, the UBC has a much more strained relationship with immigrants.\n\nIn March 2017, Bill Bing, a representative for the Northeast Regional Carpenters Council representative, even admitted in the Buffalo News that the union routinely called Ice to report undocumented workers on construction sites in upstate New York.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are very good local union and nonunion contractors who suffer the fallout from dirty business,\u201d Bing told the Buffalo News.\n\n\n\nThe leadership of North America\u2019s Building Trades Unions has traditionally been one of the whitest sectors of the labor movement. Civil rights groups have repeatedly sued construction unions to admit African Americans, and for decades, unions like the Carpenters would call immigration authorities to deport undocumented workers.\n\n\n\nHowever, over the last two decades as construction unions sought to organize larger numbers of undocumented workers, the attitude of labor has changed. Now, in the era of Trump, many labor leaders see an opportunity to accelerate those changes.\n\n\n\n\u201cHas the Trump era accelerated our efforts? Absolutely,\u201d said the Painters Union president, Ken Rigmaiden. \u201cThere are too many reasons to mention but one, in particular, is forcing 11 million immigrants back into the dark side of the construction economy, where wage theft and intimidation thrive.\u201d\n\n\n\nSince being elected in 2013 as the union\u2019s first African American president, Rigmaiden has led efforts to get construction unions to embrace immigrant labor.\n\nIn July 2017, Rigmaiden hired 30-year-old Neidi Dominguez, who immigrated to the US from Mexico when she was nine and lived here undocumented until she was 25, as the Painters Union\u2019s national strategic campaign coordinator. \n\n\n\nAs the first Latina woman to head a major department at the Painters Union, Dominguez has led efforts not only to make her union more vocal and active on immigration, but to push other unions to be more proactive. Labor leaders like Dominguez say that since the majority of new members in the construction workforce are Latinos, building trades unions must do more to embrace immigrant workers if they are going to survive.\n\n\u201cIn the building trades for too long, it\u2019s been almost nothing but a bunch of white guys. It\u2019s changing but not quick enough,\u201d said Dominguez.\n\nUnder Dominguez\u2019s leadership, the union helped to launch the Working Families United coalition, that has helped lead labor\u2019s effort to protect workers facing threats of deportation while pushing unions to be more inclusive of immigrants.\n\nBecause of Trump administration policy shifts regarding undocumented workers, the Painters Union is one of many that has become a sanctuary union and developed programs to defend their membership against the threat of deportation.\n\n\n\nNot only have the unions become more engaged in assisting their immigrant members facing deportation within their union, but externally their politics have also begun to shift.\n\n\n\nDuring the 2013 immigration debates, the AFL-CIO officially embraced the use of E-Verify system to check documentation of workers on construction. Some unions still embrace E-Verify, but many labor leaders have noticed a shift.\n\n\n\nOne factor that has helped promote the leftward shift of the building trades has been the emergence of Latino labor leaders within their unions. One of the most prominent of those is Randy Bryce, a half Mexican, half Polish ironworker from Racine, Wisconsin, known as the \u201cIron Stache\u201d for his distinctive facial hair, who has become a social media hit with his grassroots campaign against the House speaker, Paul Ryan.\n\n\n\nDespite living in a district in south-eastern Wisconsin that is only 5% Latino, Bryce has made immigration reform a central issue of his campaign; getting arrested recently during a protest against Ryan\u2019s refusal to pass the Dream Act to protect undocumented children raised in the US.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople are getting the message,\u201d said Bryce. \u201cI tell people everybody is trying to gain access to the American dream. It\u2019s getting harder and harder to find, but it\u2019s not other people risking their lives trying to come over here to find it. It\u2019s not their fault, it\u2019s the boss trying to keep their foot on all of our necks.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Michael Mcgowan", "body": "One of the architects of Australia\u2019s strict gun control laws says he is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the emergence of what he described as a US-inspired firearms lobby.\n\nTim Fischer, the former deputy prime minister and leader of the National party who alongside John Howard helped to pass landmark reforms after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, says he believes a \u201cwave\u201d of firearm lobbying influenced by the US National Rifle Association is putting renewed pressure on Australian gun laws.\n\nFischer told the Guardian he believed \u201cNRA-inspired\u201d lobbying coupled with the increased influence of rightwing parties such as One Nation in Canberra and the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party in New South Wales had influenced a \u201cpushback\u201d against Australia\u2019s gun laws, and called on politicians to stand up to pressure. \n\n\n\n\u201cWaves of NRA-originated ideology do descend on Australia and have done since 1996,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we are seeing another wave of the NRA\u2019s indirect influence descending on Australia at the federal and state levels [and] that\u2019s deeply concerning to me.\u201d\n\nFischer\u2019s warning comes in the context of an increasingly well-funded and organised gun lobby with ties to weapons importers and manufacturers.\n\nLast week the Guardian revealed that the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, was considering establishing a committee to allow gun importers to review proposed changes to firearm regulations for \u201cappropriateness and intent\u201d.\n\nThe proposal to establish the committee was put to Dutton during a private meeting with representatives from gun importer Nioa and the Shooting Industry Foundation of Australia (Sifa).\n\nA lobbying outfit whose directors include some of Australia\u2019s largest gun dealers, Sifa has only five members and represents a departure from the membership-driven model of most shooting groups in Australia.

He never got the protections in place before Tony Abbott won office and right now these areas have no protections \u2026 Until there is a plan of management, these are marine parks on paper only.\u201d\n\nThe Greens want to consult experts and the environment movement before committing to a position. One expert and one environmental group on Thursday called for the disallowance to be supported.\n\nJessica Meeuwig, director of the Centre for Marine Futures at the University of Western Australia, said she thought the management plans should be stopped by parliament. \u201cNormally I would say, \u2018This has been a long process, let\u2019s get something done,\u2019\u201d Meeuwig said. \u201cBut this one is just not remotely acceptable.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re worse than no protection because they imply that we\u2019ve solved the problem. As a scientist my concern is that if we get them up, everyone will tick the box and think we\u2019ve solved the problem.\u201d\n\nMeeuwig said the science had been ignored, and there was no evidence the partial protections proposed would have any significant environmental benefit. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say that there aren\u2019t some benefits but they\u2019re so small relative to cost.\u201d\n\nAn analysis by leading scientists of the Coalition\u2019s changes to Labor\u2019s plans found the reductions in \u201cno-take\u201d zones would have minuscule economic benefits, while undermining most of the environmental benefits.\n\nThe entire reduction of no-take zones in the Coral Sea, for example, which amounts to a reduction twice the size of Tasmania, would mostly benefit the eastern tuna and billfish fishery, most of whose operation is outside the marine reserve anyway.\n\nThe researchers found the reduction in no-take zones would increase their catch by just 10%, which is less than the normal year-to-year fluctuation in the fishery. \u201cBecause these plans are so flawed, disallowance is one of the few options left,\u201d Meeuwig said.\n\nThis view was backed by Richard Leck, WWF-Australia\u2019s head of oceans, who said the disallowance motion being pursued by Labor should be supported.\n\n\u201cThese are 10-year plans to lock in a decade of management plans that are insufficient to protect the Coral Sea,\u201d Leck said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have scientific integrity and it doesn\u2019t have the backing of the Australian people.

Bill liked data, but he believed it was insufficient \u2026 He felt it was important to talk to voters and get a real sense for what they were feeling.\u201d In the battle between raw numbers and raw emotion, the numbers won and Hillary lost.\n\nRecent revelations that Donald Trump\u2019s campaign paid Cambridge Analytica to target potential voters with bespoke messages would lead some to argue that Hillary\u2019s problem wasn\u2019t that her team privileged data over lived experience. The problem was that Team Trump had better data.\n\nIn an undercover recording for Channel 4 Cambridge Analytica\u2019s head of data, Alexander Tayler, effectively claimed Trump owed his victory to his company: \u201cWhen you think about the fact that Donald Trump lost the popular vote by 3m votes but won the electoral college vote,\u201d he bragged. \u201cThat\u2019s down to the data and the\u00a0research.\u201d\n\nThe still unfolding story of how personal information was leveraged for financial profit and political gain lays bare the vulnerability of democracy to new technology. The situation was bad enough. With social media lies can spread far faster than scrutiny can ever travel because people are now able to curate both their own news and the communities in which they distribute it. This is, partly, why 12 years after the start of the Iraq war, half of Republicans still believed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction (it didn\u2019t) and two years ago 59% of Trump supporters still thought Barack Obama was not born in America (he was). Ignorance and bigotry need no help: in the fetid pit of prejudice and presumption they can breed and disperse freely. So to have private contractors harvesting personal information and using it to target the people they think are most susceptible to certain political messages, all for electoral gain and corporate profit, is disturbing. Facebook, which stands accused of failing to monitor how data collected from the platform was being used, should be held to account; Cambridge Analytica, which was allegedly linked to the leave side in the Brexit referendum , should also be investigated.\n\nThe questions raised in the past week about the harvesting of data, and the targeting of voters based on personal information that they may have parted with unknowingly, are serious. And yet to accept the claim that outside intervention was primarily responsible for Trump\u2019s victory or the Brexit vote feels like an even more serious transgression.\n\nThere is a desire among some liberals, many even, to dismiss the events of recent years as something other than what they were \u2013 a massive political defeat. Some of this dismissiveness comes from a deeply illiberal place, that effectively insists people are too stupid to understand what they want or what is best for them. There is also a wish to avoid responsibility for failing to connect politically in the decades since the financial crisis with a message that resonated, and to seek instead a legal remedy or technical reprieve by impeaching the president or annulling the referendum.\n\nThere is no contradiction between accepting that the Russians, Facebook, ignorance, Cambridge Analytica or stupidity played a role and understanding that a far larger drama, which has been under way for far longer, makes sense of the role they were able to play. If Trump is removed by impeachment, so be it. But that will be an inadequate salve for the long-running sores that made him possible.\n\nCambridge Analytica didn\u2019t invent the racism, misogyny and xenophobia that have corroded American political culture and made Trump possible. These social pathologies were eating away at our democracies long before social media was invented. Their roots are deeper, their reach farther and their influence greater than any algorithm could conjure.\n\nThe Russians did not tell Hillary Clinton to send surrogates to Arizona shortly before the election, when they would have been far more helpful in Michigan or Wisconsin. They didn\u2019t tell her to give a speech at Goldman Sachs for $225,000 in the wake of a huge bank bailout or call half Trump\u2019s supporters a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d. Facebook hadn\u2019t been invented when she was for the Iraq war before she was against it, or when she was against gay marriage before she was for it.\n\nSocial media platforms, nefarious bots and dodgy data companies can amplify views that are already out there and distort perspectives that already exist \u2013 but they cannot invent them. In short they can manipulate the supply of ideas, but they cannot create the demand for those ideas from thin air.\n\nTrump\u2019s victory and Brexit came in a time of growing economic inequality, wage stagnation, mass migration, rising xenophobia and racial tension. Bill Clinton was right \u2013 there was a mood out there. That mood emerged from material conditions that mainstream parties had made possible over the past few decades, through, among other things, illegal war, deregulation, trade liberalisation and vile rhetoric on immigration. And on both sides of the Atlantic liberals failed to either take responsibility for this or adequately respond to its consequences. Now they are paying the price.\n\nNone of this excuses the actions of those who have sought to mislead us nor denies the power of the memes, messages and misinformation that they have produced. With some help, what begins life as received wisdom can graduate to common knowledge and mature into a full-blown script that people recite without knowing where it came from or what, precisely, it means. \u201cWe just put information [like \u2018crooked Hillary\u2019] into the bloodstream of the internet and watch it grow,\u201d claimed Cambridge Analytica\u2019s CEO, Alexander Nix, who has since been suspended. \u201cGive it a little push every now and again over time to watch it take shape \u2026 So this stuff infiltrates the online community with no branding, so it\u2019s unattributable, untrackable.\u201d\n\nWe know these things made a difference. Given the narrow margins of defeat in both the Brexit referendum and the 2016 presidential election, it is an open question whether they made the difference that tipped us over the edge. That matters.\n\nBut either way, the question remains: what were we doing so close to the edge? And how do we get out of the pit we are now in? We do not yet have the answer to the second question. But we can be fairly sure we won\u2019t find it in an algorithm.\n\n\u2022 Gary Younge is editor-at-large for the Guardian", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Greg Jericho", "body": "There is little sadder than watching business groups and companies attempt to lobby in public by promising that they\u2019ll be good. This week the Business Council of Australia delivered a statement to the crossbench senators, signed by 10 CEOs of some of Australia\u2019s largest corporations, effectively begging them to pass the company tax cut legislation.\n\nBut the statement only served to reinforce just how weak the impact of the company tax cuts will be on the lives of most workers.\n\nThe statement pledged that \u201cif the Senate passes this important legislation we, as some of the nation\u2019s largest employers, commit to invest more in Australia which will lead to employing more Australians and therefore stronger wage growth as the tax cut takes effect\u201d.\n\nPresumably this means if the legislation is not passed they will not commit to investing more in Australia?\n\nIt should be noted that while companies are crying out for a tax cut in order to employ more Australians, this week saw the government boasting of record level of employment growth. Similarly non-mining investment in the past year grew by 10% \u2013 the best result in four years and double the 30-year average annual growth of 5%.\n\nThat this can be achieved under such a high company tax rate must surely rank as an economic miracle.\n\nOf course, none of the CEOs of the 10 companies (five of which paid no tax in 2015-16) outlined any actual investments they are holding off on making unless the company tax cut goes through.\n\nIndeed because the tax cut for companies with a turnover of more than $1bn a year is only set to occur in 2022-23, and will only fully be cut to 25% in 2026-27, any suggestion of investment decisions not occurring would be based not on the current company tax rate, but on what they anticipate it will be.\n\nThat length of time also hurts the companies\u2019 and government\u2019s argument about \u201cstronger wage growth\u201d.\n\nThere is absolutely no basis for arguing a tax cut will bring about stronger wage growth immediately. The government might hope you will believe that, but none of their reasoning for the cut suggests it will happen.\n\nA company tax cut theoretically leads to stronger wage growth because firstly such a cut is supposed to increase (mostly foreign) investment in equipment, machinery and infrastructure that in turn leads to an increase in productivity.\n\nOnce that productivity increase occurs, then and only then wages growth will increase because the companies are producing more with the same amount of labour. They will thus seek to employ more and will not only raise wages to reward productivity improvements but also to entice workers to either stay or come work for them.\n\nBut of course that end result is not only predicated on productivity improvements actually leading to increased employment (which is in no way a certain thing) but also that workers will be in a position to bargain for higher wages.\n\nAnd remember as well, even according to the government\u2019s own research the improved wages growth only is to occur \u201cin the long term\u201d. And just how large that theoretical wages rise would be is also up for debate.\n\nTreasury estimated a company tax cut would lead to a long-term ongoing real wage increase of 0.4%, but new research by ANU economist Chris Murphy, which takes into account the recent changes in the US company tax rate, suggests it would be just 0.29% if financed by bracket creep.\n\nAnother new study by University of NSW Business School\u2019sprofessor of finance, Peter Swan, whose work in the 1980s for the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Financial System led to the Hawke government introducing the dividend imputation system, suggests the company tax cut won\u2019t even lead to increased foreign investment.\n\nHe argues that \u201cinvestment in Australia is already at its globally efficient untaxed level\u201d as foreign investors are already able to take advantage of tax laws that allow them to sell shares before dividend payments are made and then buy them back afterwards. He argues this negates the impact of the tax cut and that \u201ceven if the Australian corporate tax rate is reduced from 30% to 25%, there should be no new foreign investment, but more Australians should invest offshore due to the lower tax impost\u201d.\n\nHe concludes that \u201cconsequently, the tax cut plan is redundant with no billions of dollars\u2019 worth of desirable foreign investments left lying on the table\u201d.\n\nSenator Derryn Hinch was right to call the BCA\u2019s statement as \u201cvery kumbaya\u201d. There will be no way to prove any company has either increased investment or wages due to the tax cut, but there will be \u2013 as was the case in the US \u2013 lots of claims that this has occurred.\n\nBut to believe companies will pay higher wages because of this tax cut requires a great deal of naivety.\n\nWhich bring us to Senator Pauline Hanson who agreed to support the tax cut, despite having previously spoken out against it because, as she told the ABC, she was able to get funding for a \u201cpilot program\u201d for 1,000 apprentices in private business.\n\nThe ALP quickly noted the government has cut apprenticeships by 140,000 places since 2013.\n\nThe ALP is however being rather misleading about apprentice levels.\n\nA recent study by the Mitchell Institute found most of the drop in apprentices has actually been due to a drop in one-year \u201ctraineeships\u201d due to measures brought in by the Julia Gillard government to stop rorting by employers and training providers.\n\nBut even if we only focus on the more traditional \u201ctrade\u201d industries, in 2017 there were 168,000 apprentices \u2013 down 41,000 from the 209,000 in 2013.

Projections suggest that in the two decades to 2030, 3 million hectares of untouched forest will have been bulldozed in eastern Australia.\n\nThe crisis is driven primarily by a booming livestock industry but is ushered in by governments that fail to introduce restrictions and refuse to apply existing restrictions.\n\nAnd more than just trees are at stake.\n\n\n\nAustralia has an awesome biodiversity, with nearly 8% of all Earth\u2019s plant and animal species finding a home on the continent. About 85% of the country\u2019s plants, 84% of its mammals and 45% of its birds are found nowhere else.\n\nBut land clearing is putting that at risk. About three-quarters of Australia\u2019s 1,640 plants and animals listed by the government as threatened have habitat loss listed as one of their main threats.\n\nMuch of the land clearing in Queensland \u2013 which accounts for the majority in Australia \u2013 drives pollution into rivers that drain on to the Great Barrier Reef, adding to the pressures it.\n\nAnd of course land clearing is exacerbating climate change. In 1990, before short-lived land-clearing controls came into place, a quarter of Australia\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions were caused by deforestation. Emissions from land clearing dropped after 2010 but are rising sharply again.\n\n\u201cIt has gotten so bad that WWF International put it on the list of global deforestation fronts, the only one in the developed world on that list,\u201d says Martin Taylor, the protected areas and conservation science manager at WWF Australia.\n\nIn Queensland, where there is both the most clearing and the best data on clearing, trees are being bulldozed at a phenomenal rate.\n\n\n\nAbout 395,000 hectares of native vegetation were cleared there in 2015-16, 33% more compared with the previous year. And despite the re-elected Labor government promising changes to rein it in, notifications of planned land clearing in Queensland have jumped a further 30%, suggesting woodlands could be bulldozed even faster in coming years.\n\nTo visualise what clearing of that magnitude looks like, Guardian Australia has created a tool that will lay an area that size over any location you choose. Mapped over Sydney, for example, 395,000 hectares covers an area stretching from the central coast in the north, to Campbeltown in the south, and the Blue Mountains in the west.\n\nThat equates to more than 1,500 football fields worth of native woodland and scrub being cleared each and every day in Queensland.\n\nStopping the clearing in Queensland is possible. Indeed, under its Labor premier Peter Beattie it brought its land clearing problem under control. Tough laws passed in 2004 meant that by 2010 land clearing had dropped to an all-time low of about 92,000 hectares.\n\nBut when the Liberal National party\u2019s Campbell Newman was elected in 2012 he broke an election promise to keep the laws, gutted them, and introduced several ways for farmers to clear land easily. The bulldozers roared back into action immediately, bringing the state to the point it is at now.\n\nQueensland clears more land each year than the rest of Australia put together, and the rate at which it is destroying its vegetation is comparable with the infamous deforestation that occurs in the Brazilian Amazon. Brazil bulldozes about 0.25% of its part of the Amazon each year; Queensland clears about 0.45% of its remaining wooded areas.\n\nThe recently re-elected Queensland Labor government has promised to change the laws. But in the meantime other states have begun to follow Queensland\u2019s lead.\n\nIn 2016 the New South Wales Coalition government announced it was going to axe three pieces of legislation that protected native vegetation and wildlife, and replace them with a single act that would make land clearing easier.\n\nA conservation scientist from the University of Queensland, Hugh Possingham, sat on the NSW government\u2019s advisory board for the changes but resigned in protest, warning they could lead to a doubling of clearing rates in NSW.\n\nPossingham says exactly how much the laws will impact clearing rates is unclear, since there are other drivers of clearing, including climate and economics. \u201cBut if you look at Queensland, their example is so dramatic,\u201d he says of the effects of law changes there.\n\nDaisy Barham, from the Nature Conservation Council of NSW, says the final set of laws and regulations released are even worse than those that caused the land clearing crisis in Queensland. \u201cThere are some really extreme elements in the NSW laws that don\u2019t even feature in the Queensland laws,\u201d she says.\n\nBarham says the worst is the \u201cequity code\u201d which leaves few controls on clearing of properties under 100 hectares, and where protected vegetation makes up less than 10% of the property.\n\nAnalysis by WWF shows that could allow clearing of 8 million hectares, or 38% of the remaining trees in the state, under that rule alone.\n\nThe changes took effect in August 2017 but so far the government has refused to release data on how much clearing has taken place. In fact, official state data hasn\u2019t been released since 2013-14, when about 30,000 hectares of trees were cleared in NSW.\n\nThe area being cleared in there may seem small relative to Queensland, but NSW has a much smaller amount of remaining vegetation, with clearing there starting much earlier after colonisation.\n\n\u201cOnly 9% of NSW is in a healthy or near-natural condition,\u201d Barham says. \u201cWe simply don\u2019t have much left to lose. That is why every bit of clearing in NSW is so important.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, further north, vast tracts of land are being earmarked for clearing. In the relatively lawless Northern Territory, approvals for land clearing have jumped more than tenfold in the past two years, compared with the preceding 12 years, according to figures from the NT government analysed by the Wilderness Society.\n\nSome of the clearing approved for single properties in the NT is almost unimaginable in size. A property called Tipperary station has a total of 50,687 hectares approved for clearing through a number of separate applications over the past six years, an area almost 10 times the size of Manhattan on one property.\n\nDavid Morris, a lawyer who was chief executive of the Environmental Defenders Office NT until earlier this year, says the overarching feature of the Northern Territory\u2019s land clearing is the lack of regulation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a totally inept regulatory regime,\u201d says Morris, who is now chief executive of the Environmental Defenders Office NSW. He says land-clearing projects go through an environmental assessment framework, which the government has admitted is inadequate. \u201cThey\u2019ve committed to reform it but in the meantime all approvals go through this very poor assessment regime.\u201d\n\nIn addition, major land-clearing proposals that occur on pastoral leases are assessed by a body called the Pastoral Lands Board, which adds further problems.\n\n\u201cIt is made up of four pastoralists and one rangelands scientist,\u201d Morris says. \u201cThere is a very clear trend of increased approvals of broad-scale land clearing in the Northern Territory. And there is a regulatory regime that is incapable of dealing with the individual and cumulative impacts of that clearing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving a board full of agricultural business people as the ultimate decision maker is mind-boggling,\u201d says Glenn Walker, a Wilderness Society climate campaign manager. Glenn Walker, adding: \u201cThe NT has the worst regulation for deforestation of any jurisdiction in Australia.\u201d\n\nAnd the spread of the land-clearing crisis doesn\u2019t look set to stop in the NT. Some of Australia\u2019s richest graziers are establishing cattle stations in Western Australia, and making claims for greater access to resources in the pristine Kimberley.\n\nOther states have their own clearing tragedies unfolding: some of Australia\u2019s most majestic and oldest trees are being cut down for timber by a state-owned company in Victoria, which has even less left to lose than NSW. And Tasmania has just signed up to allow more logging in its national parks until at least 2037, a move NSW and Victoria are considering following.\n\nCombined, eastern Australia is considered a global deforestation hotspot, the only one in the developed world. According to analysis by WWF\u2019s Martin Taylor, Australia is likely to lose 3 million hectares of trees in the next 15 years.\n\nAnd all that is putting things Australians care most about under threat.\n\n\u201cIf you care about the Great Barrier Reef, then that\u2019s what you care about,\u201d he says. The effects of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef are multiplied by land clearing in Queensland, since it increases the amount of sediment that flows into rivers, and eventually on to the coral. That can starve them of light, and decrease their resilience to other impacts.\n\nWWF analysis estimated that 45 million animals are killed each year in Queensland, just from the bulldozing of their habitat. \u201cPeople have very strong feelings about cruelty and mistreatment of animals,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cSo what must they think of that then? That we\u2019re bulldozing 45 million animals to death every year?\u201d\n\nBoth in Australia and around the world, habitat loss is by far the biggest threat to animals facing extinction.\n\n\u201cIf you care about koalas, and if you care about Australian wildlife \u2013 if you want your kids to see them \u2013 then that\u2019s what you care about,\u201d he says.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Staff", "body": "Tens of thousands of Slovaks have rallied to demand the resignation of prime minister Robert Fico\u2019s government following the murder of a journalist that has shocked the central European nation and stoked anger over sleaze in public life.\n\nJan Kuciak and his fiancee, Martina Kusnirova, both 27, were found shot dead at their home near Bratislava on 25 February.

The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has suspended cooperation with the Ice patrols.\n\nBut a September 2016 Home Office training document obtained by the Guardian, which features the St Mungo\u2019s logo, states: \u201cThis teamwork which sees both the charity referring eligible people to immigration enforcement [IE] for help with voluntary returns and IE referring people to St Mungo\u2019s has already proved beneficial for both bodies.\u201d\n\nAsked about its work with the Home Office, St Mungo\u2019s admitted that some of its contracts with local authorities have specified that they should work with Ice teams. \u201cI get why that can be seen as strange and unpopular for some people,\u201d said Petra Salva, the charity\u2019s director of rough sleeping services. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult climate we\u2019re operating in.\u201d\n\nAsked about the work described in the 2016 document, Salva described how officials from Home Office enforcement teams \u201cgo up to individuals sleeping in sleeping bags and interview them, sometimes they end up arresting them\u201d.\n\nAsked to clarify whether its teams still worked with Home Office patrols, a spokesperson for the charity said: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe our outreach staff have accompanied Ice teams this year.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt continues to work with the Home Office by passing on details of people from other countries who wish to return home.\n\nThe disclosure of its past work with the Home Office drew criticism from elsewhere in the charitable sector.

He said he would be \u201cTrump\u2019s wingman\u201d in Washington and touted himself as \u201cTrump before Trump\u201d.

Outside a polling place in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, Joe Morgan told the Guardian: \u201cI approve of the way the president is trying to put the country in a better spot and I think voting Republican will help him do that.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, another voter, Paul Kane, told the Guardian he voted for Lamb because \u201cTrump\u2019s an asshole\u201d.\n\nThree counties have yet to count absentee ballots, delaying any final result.

The district itself will not exist for the midterm elections after the Pennsylvania supreme court ruled the current congressional map unconstitutional. The vacancy was created when the pro-life Republican Tim Murphy resigned in disgrace after it was revealed he had pressured his mistress to have an abortion.\n\nIf Lamb pulls out a win, it would be the first time Democrats have picked up a seat in the House of Representatives since Trump took office.

On civil rights and the environmental crisis, the most important issues of his lifetime, he championed the wrong policies.\n\nGraham was on the wrong side of history.\n\nThe world\u2019s most famous evangelist let his apocalyptic anticipation of the coming kingdom of God blind him to the realities of living in this world.\n\nFor Graham, the Bible had a clear message for Christians living in what he believed were humans\u2019 last days on earth. Individuals alone can achieve salvation; governments cannot. Conversions change behaviors; federal policies do not.\n\nThese convictions shaped the evangelist\u2019s views on civil rights.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Graham integrated his revivals and seemed to support the burgeoning civil rights movement. This is the Graham most Americans remember.\n\n\n\nBut as the movement grew, expanded, and became increasingly confrontational, the evangelist\u2019s position changed.\n\nOnce leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr began practicing civil disobedience and asking for the federal government to guarantee African Americans\u2019 rights, Graham\u2019s support evaporated.\n\nWithin days of the publication of King\u2019s famous 1963 Letter from a Birmingham Jail, Graham told reporters that the Baptist minister should \u201cput the brakes on a little bit.\u201d\n\nHe criticized civil rights activists for focusing on changing laws rather than hearts.\n\nIn 1971, Graham published The Jesus Generation, a book on the coming apocalypse. Looking for signs of Jesus\u2019s Second Coming had become an obsession of Graham\u2019s, as it was for millions of other evangelicals in the mid-20th century.\n\nIn the book Graham praised the wisdom of young people who rejected the federal government as a tool for rectifying injustices.\n\n\u201cThese young people,\u201d he explained, \u201cdon\u2019t put much stock in the old slogans of the New Deal, the Fair Deal, the New Frontier, and the Great Society. They believe that utopia will arrive only when Jesus returns. Thus these young people are on sound Biblical ground.\u201d\n\nFor six decades Graham taught Americans that the federal government could not be an instrument of God to bring about justice, not on race matters and not on other significant issues. Although he believed in racial equality, his theology blinded him to what we now know was the best means for achieving that equality.\n\nMore recently, the evangelist denied the threat of global warming as well as federal efforts to stymie it.\n\nIn a 1992 book focused on the signs that the world was nearing its end, the preacher suggested that if humankind was going to survive, businesses needed to reduce pollution and stop contributing to global warming.\n\nIn a revised, 2010 version of the book, Graham eliminated the phrase \u201cglobal warming\u201d from the text altogether. Global warming no longer existed in the mind of Graham as a real threat.\n\nHe went on to assure readers that the earth will not \u201cbe saved through legislation.\u201d The federal government, he indicated, had no business passing laws to protect the earth for future generations.\n\nGraham\u2019s positions on civil rights and the environment are not those of a right-wing crank, or of a paranoid anti-intellectual. Graham takes his Bible and his theology seriously. The political positions he has embraced derive from a careful and serious study of the scriptures.\n\nGraham came of age during Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s massive expansion of government power. But rather than join with social gospel advocates like Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins in promoting the creation of a welfare state to serve the needy, the future evangelist was more influenced by apocalypse-obsessed, fundamentalist rabble rousers who rejected New Deal liberalism.\n\nGraham, like most fundamentalists of his generation, determined that the New Deal state represented godless competition for the churches rather than a potential ally.\n\nThis is a message that appeared again and again in Graham\u2019s many books on Jesus\u2019s Second Coming. Only the return of Jesus will right social wrongs, he concluded.\n\nThe expansion of state power, in contrast, was a necessary precursor to the rise of the Antichrist. The evangelist felt sure that as we approach the end of time, the world\u2019s governments were going to take away Christians\u2019 rights and liberties.\n\nThe New Deal with its intrusive regulations was the first step, Obamacare with its contraception mandates the most recent.\n\nYet Graham insisted that the inevitability of the Second Coming was no justification for indifference. \u201cWe must not feel that we are to sit back and do nothing to fight evil just because some day the four horsemen will come with full and final force upon the earth,\u201d Graham wrote. Instead, he prodded evangelicals to elect people to office who shared his anti-statist worldview.\n\nThey did. White evangelicals played an outsized role in recent political campaigns, supporting every Republican presidential candidate from Ronald Reagan to Donald J Trump.\n\nGraham had the opportunity to lead fundamentalists into a new era. He could have pushed them to take social reform seriously as a God-given mandate to save the world from environmental destruction. He could have tackled racism, America\u2019s original sin, by championing the federal government\u2019s aggressive civil rights policies.\n\nBut he squandered it. He could not overcome the speculative end-times schemes of his cohort of evangelicals, with their anti-government hostilities.\n\nGraham had good intentions, as his work desegregating his crusades demonstrated. But when his influence really would have counted, when he could have effected real change, real social transformation, he was too locked into last-days fearmongering to recognize the potential of the state to do good. We are all paying the price.\n\nA different kind of last days may soon be upon us. Racial tensions are rising, the earth is warming, and evangelicals are doing little to help.

Pine plantations have become an important habitat for the bird but those are being harvested, without replacement, at a rate of 1,000 hectares per year since 2004. The plantation has declined from 23,000 ha at one point to 7,000 ha today, the report said.\n\nBirdLife Australia said it had written to state and federal environment ministers requesting that \u201charvesting without replacement\u201d of those plantations be considered a \u201ccontrolled action\u201d, and therefore subject to federal environmental assessment. Although the federal minister has the power to determine it as a \u201ccontrolled action,\u201d BirdLife said that hasn\u2019t happened, showing the system is vulnerable to politicisation.\n\nMeanwhile, exemptions and loopholes to federal environment law have meant it isn\u2019t able to protect the critically endangered swift parrot, which now numbers fewer than 1,000 pairs in the wild.\n\nRegional forest agreements are 20-year plans that allow the logging industry to harvest trees from native forests, and exempt the actions from restrictions in federal environmental law. As some of them are expiring, they have either been, or are in the process of being, rolled over for another 20 years.\n\nThe report said that despite the swift parrot being determined a \u201cpriority species\u201d in some RFAs, its habitat has been routinely felled in native forests over the past 20 years.\n\nCumulative impacts fail to be properly considered by existing environmental law too, the report said. The black-throated finch, despite being extinct in NSW and endangered under federal environmental law, has had its occurrence contract by 80% in the past 30 years.\n\nThe report said that has occurred through hundreds of small developments, each of which has a relatively small impact but is cumulatively threatening the species with extinction. It notes 772 projects that overlap on black-throated finch habitat have been referred for assessment under federal environmental law, but for the majority of those it was determined they could go ahead without federal assessment.\n\n\u201cMost of those applications were approved without consideration of the cumulative impacts on our finches,\u201d said Lau. \u201cDecisions to approve developments that destroy habitat are being made in isolation from one another and as a result the southern black-throated finch is now headed for extinction.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor other species, especially those that only exist on islands \u2013 such as the King Island scrubtit and the King Island brown thornbill \u2013 there is no government agency tasked with collecting adequate information about the species in order to protect it.\n\nIn many other cases, threatened species are not having recovery plans established for them \u2013 something that was legally required to be created until an amendment to the law in 2007. BirdLife Australia analysis found that of the 67 nationally listed endangered and critically endangered birds, only 15 are covered by up-to-date recovery plans.\n\nThe opposition environment spokesman, Tony Burke, has said the push to introduce national laws would be considered at the ALP conference this year, and he was consulting about updating the act.\n\nBurke told the Guardian this week that existing laws need to be properly applied to protect threatened species.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t protect species without protecting habitat. That means using a series of powers available under law,\u201d Burke said.\n\n\u201cOne of the principle challenges when we have conservative governments in power is the section of the EPBC Act that deals with approvals are the only sections they are committed to. That leads down a pathway of offsets where the habitat is somewhere between 20 and 80 years away, protected areas which go backwards and conservation outcomes screech to a halt.\u201d\n\nThe office of the minister for energy and the environment, Josh Frydenberg, has been contacted for comment but he has previously said the existing act continues to be the best mechanism for the federal government to protect the most important and sensitive matters.\n\nThe report is being released ahead of a symposium called Better Laws for a Better Planet, hosted by a number of groups including the Australian Panel of Experts on Environmental Law and the IUCN National Committee Australia, on 27 March in Canberra.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Guy Verhofstadt", "body": "On Tuesday, Jean-Claude Juncker wrote to Vladimir Putin to congratulate him on his electoral success, presumably taking inspiration from the list of global demagogues and dictators who were also quick to send their congratulations, from President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela to President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus.\n\nPresident Trump followed, but at least his advisers had given express instruction: \u201cDO NOT CONGRATULATE\u201d. Which, of course, the American president ignored. Shamefully, neither Juncker nor Trump mentioned the deployment of Russian-made chemical weapons in Salisbury, nor did they raise concerns about the legitimacy of the so-called \u201celection\u201d we have just witnessed in Russia.\n\nMichael Link, the German MP who led the independent OSCE election-monitoring mission to Russia, has been clear that they found there was no \u201creal choice\u201d for voters. Voters were herded to polling booths, and ballot boxes stuffed, while the main opposition leader Alexei Navalny was banned from standing. So, no, this is no time for congratulations. Yes, we will always need dialogue with Russia, but closer ties must be conditional on respect for the rule of law.\n\nToo often, the west has rolled over while the Russian bear mauls our liberal democracies, corrupts our political systems, hacks our political parties, pollutes our online ecosystems, and seeks to drag European countries back to a violent and divided past. While European leaders have responded with warm words of support for Britain in the wake of the Salisbury incident, we need to deliver a serious collective European response that can be framed as part of a new EU strategy towards Russia.\n\nWith this new strategy we should show to Mr Putin that his violations of international law have clear consequences, but also open up the perspective of cooperation and engagement, provided Russia starts delivering on its commitments under international law and starting with the implementation of the Minsk agreements. Instead of sending congratulation letters, EU leaders, and in particular  Federica Mogherini, should therefore come up with such a proactive strategy. First of all she should push for clear EU-wide sanctions in response to the Sergei Skripal case. If there is one thing that truly alarms the mafia elite surrounding Putin, it is the prospect of being denied access to their European villas.\n\nIt is essential that Brexit does not weaken foreign policy and security cooperation across Europe. The European parliament\u2019s proposal for an umbrella EU\u2013UK Association Agreement sets out a framework for delivering this. We must ensure security and defence agreements are in place before the end of the transition period. We need a comprehensive, Mueller-style, EU-wide investigation into the extent of Russian influence on our democracies, economies and political systems, which can set out credible responses. It is wrong that Russian billionaires can buy EU citizenship in Malta, launder money in London property through shell companies and seemingly donate to European political parties at will.\n\nAt the same time we have to overcome the current stalemate where EU-Russia contacts are frozen, but member states continue developing bilateral channels with Russia, often serving narrow national interests. The EU and Nato need to reopen channels of communication to reduce the risk of misunderstandings and miscalculations \u2013 as was the case during the cold war.\n\nA new strategy could be built on the logic of the Helsinki process of the 1970s. A Helsinki 2.0 would strengthen European security architecture through opening up the perspective for a political and economic engagement with Russia. In exchange for full respect of the Minsk agreements, compliance with international law and also progress when it comes to free and fair elections and respect for human rights inside Russia, the EU would not only lift economic sanctions but progressively deepen political and economic cooperation.\n\nThis strategy would also make clear that our dispute is with the current Russian government, not with the Russian people. We should therefore open our universities and labour markets to the best and brightest young Russians citizens and unilaterally facilitate visas for Russian citizens. Support for independent civil society activists, the free media and NGOs in Russia should be enhanced.\n\nMost importantly, we have to swiftly build a Defence Union, as a European pillar of Nato. For decades, we have relied on the US and failed to invest in modern defences and the integration of our capacities. Many European politicians refuse to make the case to the people for a European defence and security capacity, for fear of falling foul of the Eurosceptics that Putin sponsors; we find ourselves trapped in a vicious cycle.\n\nI hope the younger generation of current European leaders, from Emmanuel Macron to Leo Varadkar, will have the courage to be bolder and make the case for an integrated European defence.\n\nMany don\u2019t want to accept the truth because it means hard choices have to be made, but the reality is that the Kremlin is again at war with our liberal democracies.

Bump stocks were used by Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock to kill 58 people in the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history.

It was one of his first pieces of work experience after graduating from the University of East Anglia with a degree in economics, and for someone who describes himself as a \u201cnatural Eurosceptic\u201d it was a plum role. \u201cIt was like a startup. Everyone was throwing ideas around and saying different things. You\u2019re given a lot of creative freedom.\u201d He was still living at home in Solihull, but was travelling in by train, a few days each week, to work in Vote Leave\u2019s headquarters at Millbank Tower in London, overlooking the Thames.\n\nVote Leave\u2019s senior directors were quick to realise how useful he would be for the campaign. \u201cA huge part of campaigns is to make sure you diversify,\u201d says Sanni. \u201cAnd we discussed how crucial it was that Vote Leave didn\u2019t appear racist.\u201d\n\nSo, it was: \u201cHere\u2019s the brown guy\u201d?\n\nIt was a role he was happy to play, though, helping with their black and ethnic minority outreach efforts. \u201cAt university all my friends were \u2018Remain, Remain, Remain\u2019, but when I started doing research into it, I realised I\u2019m a nerdy Eurosceptic. And even after all this, I would still vote Leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll this\u201d is why Sanni is talking today. Because it\u2019s what happened next that\u2019s the issue \u2013 a sequence of events that began in March 2016, when one of Vote Leave\u2019s senior directors, Stephen Parkinson, who is now Theresa May\u2019s political secretary, asked Sanni if he would be interested in helping with one of Vote Leave\u2019s official youth groups, BeLeave.\n\n\u201cBeLeave was very progressive; it was aimed at young, liberal Leavers. They were talking about African farmers being discriminated against\u2026 it totally aligned with my values.\u201d\n\nBeLeave had been set up and was being run from within Vote Leave\u2019s HQ by another volunteer, 23-year-old fashion student Darren Grimes, whose main role was creating ads and messaging to share on social media. \u201cHis content was just really, really good. They were just cool, simple graphics that people would share. His creative side shone through. Everyone recognised that.\u201d\n\nSanni continued to campaign for Vote Leave, but he was also now helping BeLeave. Then about a month before the referendum, \u201cCleo tells us someone, a sponsor, wants to give money to BeLeave\u201d.\n\nThis was Cleo Watson, another senior director at Vote Leave \u2013 its head of outreach. Now, like Parkinson, Watson works at No 10 Downing Street, as political adviser to Theresa May.\n\nWhen Watson said a donor had expressed interest in giving money to BeLeave so it could expand its work, Sanni and Grimes wrote a proposal. They could treble the impact of their Facebook content, they reckoned, if they could get a few thousand pounds to spend on ads. \u201cWe were like: \u2018If we had \u00a310,000, this is what we could do: we could have X number of paid adverts and reach so many people.\u2019\u201d\n\nWatson told them they needed to speak to Vote Leave\u2019s internal lawyer and head of compliance. \u201cAnd he said the only way to get money was to set [BeLeave] up as a separate organisation. So, we were like: \u2018OK, cool. How do we do that?\u2019 And so he wrote up the constitution for us. And Darren put his own name on it. Because that\u2019s what he was told to do.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer helped Sanni and Grimes to draw up the documents, which they signed on 18 May, and he told them to open a bank account.\n\nBut no donor ever materialised. Later, in the crucial final fortnight before the referendum, the talk in the Vote Leave office was about how the campaign was both running out of money and about to hit its spending limit of \u00a37m. And then, 10 days before the referendum, Vote Leave learned that they had received a donation of \u00a31m. Because of their spending limits, they suggested this could be given as a donation to BeLeave. Not the few thousand pounds they had asked for, though. The proposed sum was initially \u00a3400,000 but ended up close to \u00a3700,000.\n\nWhat was your reaction?\n\n\u201cWe were ecstatic. It was amazing. Can you imagine\u2026 you\u2019re 22 and you\u2019re given nearly a million pounds? I think I added that to my LinkedIn profile that same day.\u201d\n\nToday, though, for Sanni, that campaign, the money, the creative work, and everything associated with it is tainted. What he has spent months coming to terms with is that this donation may not have had anything to do with BeLeave\u2019s creativity and flair. \u201cVote Leave didn\u2019t really give us that money,\u201d he says. \u201cThey just pretended to. We had no control over it. We were 22-year-old students. You\u2019re not going to just give nearly a million pounds to a pair of students and let them do whatever.\u201d\n\nTo Sanni\u2019s mind, what this means is: \u201cThey cheated.\u201d\n\nThe question is whether this was a strategy to get around the strict electoral spending limits enforced by law. If election campaigns coordinate, they have to declare their spending together. Spending limits are the bedrock of our parliamentary democracy: our electoral laws control the amount of money that can be spent in elections \u2013 which for the official designated campaign group is \u00a37m. But a perfectly legal loophole exists: separate campaigns can spend up to \u00a3700,000 in excess of that. Just as long as they don\u2019t co-ordinate \u2013 or, in the Electoral Commission\u2019s words, \u201cwork together\u201d.\n\nSo was BeLeave a separate campaign? Vote Leave insist it was and the Electoral Commission agreed back in April 2017. But Sanni \u2013 and he has a wealth of documents \u2013 now thinks it wasn\u2019t. He believes BeLeave \u201cworked together\u201d with Vote Leave.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lie. The whole thing. It was never separate.\u201d And he has a whole dossier of emails, text messages and other files. What\u2019s more: \u201cThey told us to set up the bank account, but no money ever went into it. I was the treasurer and secretary of BeLeave and I never saw the money. I had no control over it. It was Vote Leave who decided everything.\u201d The money went straight to Vote Leave\u2019s Canadian data analytics firm \u2013 AggregateIQ (AIQ).\n\nIt\u2019s an extraordinary revelation. The Observer has been one of a number of publications and campaign groups that have picked away at the story behind this donation. Because one thing is clear: something smelled bad. It\u2019s been the subject of two Electoral Commission investigations, an inquiry by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, numerous Freedom of Information requests, multiple articles and a judicial review. The latest investigation is still live. And nobody has yet been able to answer the question posed in the very first article by BuzzFeed on 2 August 2016: \u201cWhy did Vote Leave donate \u00a3625,000 to a 23-year-old fashion student during the referendum?\u201d\n\nUntil now. Because Sanni knows exactly why. \u201cWe were two broke college students. Darren\u2019s working-class as well. And it\u2019s his name all over this. He\u2019s the one being investigated. It\u2019s his name on the form. And he just did what Vote Leave told him.\u201d\n\nSanni is quite profoundly anti-Europe. He doesn\u2019t believe in what he calls EU \u201cpassport discrimination\u201d. And having moved here from Pakistan, he loves this country with the passion that, he says, maybe only an immigrant can feel. \u201cBritain saved my family,\u201d he says. \u201cI voted Leave. And if there was a second referendum, I would vote Leave again. But I now know my vote was based on cheating. And that\u2019s what I cannot stand.\u201d\n\nTo say it\u2019s a brave decision to come forward is a huge understatement. Sanni is still only 24. The CEO of Vote Leave, Matthew Elliott, is the co-founder of the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, where Sanni works on pro-Brexit social media messaging. And a lot of his friends are still in that same pro-Brexit world, including Darren Grimes, who now works for another Matthew Elliott outfit, the website BrexitCentral.\n\nSanni lives in BrexitLand. His career has been built on Brexit. And his decision to come forward has been far from straightforward. Back in August, we discussed him going on the record anonymously, but even that felt too risky. He was worried about his mother \u2013 a teacher who came to Britain as a single mother from Pakistan less than a decade ago \u2013 and his two sisters. But it\u2019s also part of what has prompted his decision.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from Pakistan. And for someone that came here seeking a new life, a better life, one where my mum and my sisters could live freely, in a country where my decision as a voter actually matters and is truthful\u2026 this is a huge deal.\u201d\n\nThe first inkling that something wasn\u2019t right came when journalists from BuzzFeed and Private Eye got sight of BeLeave\u2019s audit to the Electoral Commission and found what BuzzFeed noted was \u201ca highly unusual transfer of funds\u201d. Namely that Darren Grimes was recorded as having received a total of \u00a3675,315 in four donations spread over eight days shortly before polling day \u2013 on 13, 16, 20 and 21 June.\n\nSanni shrugged it off. \u201cI just thought: \u2018Oh, this is how politics is. It\u2019s remoaners trying to smear us and our hard work.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Grimes was less sanguine. Sanni still has his Facebook messages, which show his confusion and panic. \u201cI\u2019ve had three journalists this morning,\u201d one says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should go back to GP and be like I\u2019m dying or just fight through it.\u201d (A reference, Sanni says, to the state of his health.) Grimes then forwarded an email he\u2019d received from a Vote Leave director: \u201cSo as discussed we think you should refuse to speak to hacks about it and just email them something like this: \u2018We received donations in a standard legal way and have reported them according to the rules.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the BuzzFeed article, Grimes says: \u201cWe received donations in a standard legal way and have reported them according to the rules.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s Sanni believes, and says is reflected in the multiple pages of evidence that he has gathered, is that Vote Leave directed BeLeave\u2019s actions before it became a separate campaign, after it became a separate campaign, and throughout the referendum.\n\nWhat\u2019s also clear, in the pages of messages from Grimes, is how the donation \u2013 which has put him front and centre of the media coverage \u2013 has affected him. His messages to Sanni make distressing reading. As a teenager, Grimes was bullied. He grew up in a working-class community in County Durham, and Sanni describes him as sensitive and vulnerable to criticism.\n\nWhen the letter arrived from the Electoral Commission, announcing it needed to make an \u201cassessment\u201d, he really started to panic. \u201cHe rang me up and told me to delete my emails. I didn\u2019t understand it. I said: \u2018We\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019 But he was panicking. So I just did it.\u201d\n\nSanni still had no inkling that there was anything seriously amiss. \u201cWe were advised every step of the way by Vote Leave\u2019s lawyers. They literally told us what to do and where to sign. I couldn\u2019t understand how we had done anything wrong.\u201d\n\nAnd then he found the drive: a shared Google drive that Vote Leave had set up and that has every appearance of being a smoking gun. It\u2019s here that Grimes and Sanni shared content with key Vote Leave directors, including campaign director Dominic Cummings, and Vote Leave\u2019s data analytics firm, AIQ.\n\n\u201cI looked at it and I thought \u2018Oh, my God.\u2019 That\u2019s when I realised things were serious. I was, \u2018OK, this is really fucked up.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat Sanni realised was that on 17 March 2017, Victoria Woodcock, the chief operating officer of Vote Leave, went through the drive and deleted herself, Cummings and Vote Leave\u2019s digital director, Henry de Zoete, from more than 100 files. However the system logged a record of her activity. It is not known whether or not she was acting under instruction.\n\nThis was 17 days after the Electoral Commission had written to Vote Leave and Darren Grimes, telling them that it was opening an investigation into the donation. And 13 days after the Observer had announced the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office was launching an inquiry into the use of data in the referendum.\n\nTo Sanni it was obvious that something was seriously amiss \u2013 that this was evidence that had been deleted. Woodcock had painstakingly gone through the files one by one, and removed their names from them. Not one or two, but 140 of them. On a blog post published on Friday, Cummings says this is \u201cfactually wrong and libellous\u201d. Vote Leave say staff acted \u201cethically, responsibly and legally in deleting any data\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat did you do when you saw that on the drive?\u201d I ask Sanni.\n\nI\u2019ve spent countless hours this year talking to Christopher Wylie, and it was through him that I first heard about Shahmir Sanni\u2019s role in the EU referendum. Wylie is the whistleblower whose revelations in the Observer last weekend about Cambridge Analytica and Facebook precipitated such an astonishing global fallout. Cambridge Analytica\u2019s CEO, Alexander Nix, has been suspended, while at one stage Facebook saw around $60bn wiped off its share price. On Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg apologised.\n\nChristopher Wylie is not just at the heart of the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook scandal. He\u2019s at the heart of Brexit too.\n\nIt was Wylie who introduced both Sanni and Grimes to Vote Leave. Politics is a small world, and Wylie\u2019s work with the Lib Dems in the coalition government had brought him into contact with both Lib Dems and Tories. Grimes and Sanni were both friends of Wylie, and it was he who introduced them to Stephen Parkinson of Vote Leave. In a statement released this week, Stephen Parkinson said: \u201cI was not introduced to Shahmir Sanni or Darren Grimes by Chris Wylie as he is claiming, but by a mutual friend from university.\u201d\n\nIt is Wylie\u2019s role elsewhere that is pivotal. Because he didn\u2019t just play a founding role in setting up Cambridge Analytica: he also helped in the setting up of AIQ, the Canadian data services and \u201cdigital advertising\u201d firm to which Vote Leave allocated 40% of its \u00a36.8m spend.\n\nIn February last year, I wrote my first report about Cambridge Analytica, interrogating what work it had done for Nigel Farage\u2019s Leave.EU campaign. It kicked off two investigations into Cambridge Analytica\u2019s role in Brexit: one by the Electoral Commission into its work for Leave.EU; the other by the ICO into how it used data. Since then, both organisations have denied that Cambridge Analytica did any paid or unpaid work for Leave.EU. However, on Friday, a former director of the data firm, Brittany Kaiser, said she was told to deny any work had been done. \u201cIn my opinion, I was lying,\u201d she said. \u201dI felt like we should say \u2018this is exactly what we did\u2019.\u201d This is consistent with what I have been reporting for more than a year.\n\nIn March, after the first article was published, I got a tip-off. Vote Leave \u2013 the official leave campaign group in the referendum \u2013 was entirely separate from Leave.EU, but the data analytics firm Vote Leave used, AIQ, was linked to SCL Elections, the parent company that set up Cambridge Analytica with Robert Mercer\u2019s funds. AIQ was until last year listed on its website as \u201cSCL Canada\u201d.\n\nIt was my attempt to prove this, to figure out the link, that first led me to Wylie. \u201cIf you want to understand where Canada fits into this,\u201d an ex-employee of Cambridge Analytica told me, \u201cyou need to find Christopher Wylie.\u201d So I did.\n\nWylie was the key to understanding how Cambridge Analytica had harvested upwards of 50m Facebook profiles. And he was the key to understanding the link between Cambridge Analytica and AIQ.\n\n\u201cI helped set up AIQ in 2013,\u201d he told me in our first conversation. \u201cThey\u2019re my friends. We needed someone to build Cambridge Analytica\u2019s technology platform and manage their databases, and I asked my friend Jeff.\u201d\n\nJeff Silvester was Wylie\u2019s first employer, a man he had known since he was 16 and who went on to co-found AIQ. Last May, Wylie showed me a document that proved the link: an intellectual property agreement that showed SCL Elections owned AIQ\u2019s IP \u201cin perpetuity\u201d. This document shows the link between Cambridge Analytica and AIQ. Between Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon and Brexit. What\u2019s more, says Wylie, AIQ deployed the algorithms that Cambridge Analytica built. \u201cAIQ managed Ripon, Cambridge Analytica\u2019s platform, and built a lot of the tech to connect the algorithms to social and online advertising networks.\u201d In response to our questions, AggregateIQ said: \u201cAggregateIQ has always been 100 per cent Canadian owned and operated. AggregateIQ never worked or even communicated in anyway with Cambridge Analytica, or any other parties related to Cambridge Analytica, with respect to the Brexit campaign.\u201d\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, almost all of AIQ\u2019s work came via Cambridge Analytica. They worked closely with Cambridge Analytica\u2019s vice-president, Steve Bannon, on multiple political campaigns in the US. \u201cBannon was always interested in Brexit,\u201d says Wylie. \u201cHe saw Britain as a cultural leader. And where Britain led, America would follow.\u201d\n\nIn total, \u00a33.9m of leave campaign funds were spent with AIQ. Four different groups used the firm, even though all these campaigns were supposedly separate and could only \u201cwork together\u201d if they shared their spending limits. Vote Leave spent \u00a32,697,000. There was the \u00a3675,000 via BeLeave. A sum of \u00a3100,000 that Vote Leave donated to Veterans for Britain, which Veterans for Britain then paid to AIQ. AIQ also received \u00a332,750 from the Democratic Unionist party. Whichever way one looks at it, AIQ would seem to be fundamental to the data-driven targeting of \u201cpersuadables\u201d in the final days of the campaign.\n\nThese four campaign groups mysteriously and independently found the same tiny data analytics firm, located in a sleepy town on an island off the west coast of Canada, 5,000 miles away.\n\nIn April 2017, Dominic Cummings told me by email that Vote Leave had found the firm \u201con the internet\u201d. Darren Grimes told the Electoral Commission the same thing. The only problem? Online archives show that AIQ\u2019s website didn\u2019t show up in Google searches until after the referendum. \u201cI looked at the time,\u201d says Sanni. \u201cI was, like, \u2018Who is AIQ?\u2019 And there was nothing. No website. Nothing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Cummings who is widely acknowledged to be the mastermind of Vote Leave. A close friend of Michael Gove, he had worked as his special adviser when Gove was minister of education, alongside another senior Vote Leave director, its head of digital, Henry de Zoete.\n\nNobody is in any doubt about Cummings\u2019s brilliance: he\u2019s advertised it widely, and written thousands of words about his strategy on his blog \u2013 about how he spent 98% of his budget online; how Vote Leave\u2019s ads received nearly a billion impressions; and how, in the end, it came down to just 600,000 people, or just over 1% of registered votes. \u201cA small enough margin,\u201d he notes, that \u201ca few specific events and decisions\u201d made all the difference.\n\nHe\u2019s also been very specific about the pivotal role played by AIQ. The firm\u2019s website featured a quote from Cummings about Brexit: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done it without them.\u201d This was removed from the site this week. AIQ told the Observer that \u201cthe services it provided to Vote Leave were in accordance with instructions given by Vote Leave\u201d, and \u201cthe services provided to BeLeave were in accordance given by BeLeave\u201d.\n\nThe final weeks of the Brexit campaign were the most crucial. On his blog, Cummings says they code-named the period \u201cWaterloo\u201d and ramped up its spending, bombarding the small sliver of people it had identified as \u201cpersuadable\u201d with every kind of ad. And it worked. Cummings\u2019s campaign was a triumph. It had overcome all the odds. There\u2019s no doubt that he won the war of the internet.\n\nBut the question about this donation, the \u00a3675,000 that went to Darren Grimes (to him personally because BeLeave was not a limited company), the four campaigns that all used AIQ, and AIQ\u2019s links to Cambridge Analytica\u2026 all this has dogged the result for 18 months now.\n\nLast autumn, Cummings took himself off Twitter. A freedom of information effort by Peter Geoghegan and Adam Ramsay of Open Democracy became the basis for a judicial review by the Good Law Project\u2019s Jolyon Maugham QC, and in November, in what was front-page news, the Electoral Commission reopened its investigation into Darren Grimes and the donation. It had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d, it said, \u201cto suspect an offence may have been committed.\u201d\n\nCummings masterminded Vote Leave\u2019s strategy. And CEO Matthew Elliott signed it all off. But neither has been named by the Electoral Commission or the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office in any of the multiple subsequent investigations. As Sanni points out, \u201cIt\u2019s Darren\u2019s name all over everything. He\u2019s the one in the frame.\u201d And he\u2019s the one, according to Sanni, who has borne the brunt of the stress and anxiety that\u2019s followed.\n\nThis is the heart of the story, and it\u2019s what has ultimately prompted Shahmir Sanni to go on the record.\n\n\u201cDarren is totally loyal,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they knew that.\u201d\n\nAnd it was witnessing the toll the investigation was taking on Grimes that finally made Sanni realise the seriousness of the charges.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the impact on Darren\u2019s health that made me go: \u2018Something\u2019s fucked up. Something\u2019s wrong.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn evidence that Sanni has submitted to the Electoral Commission, he includes Facebook messages that Grimes sent him at the time senior Vote Leave staff were trying to arrange the donation; text messages that make poignant reading in the light of what happened next.\u201d\n\nGrimes: \u201cI was a bit worried about things going wrong tbh [\u2026] Especially with the prying eyes because of the expenses scandal.\u201d\n\nGrimes: \u201cManaging accounts/handling that sum of money and making sure everything is properly accounted for I guess. I have a lot to manage pretty much alone because people are flakey [sic]. And the last thing I need is to end up fucking up. Haha.\u201d\n\nSanni: \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve got anything to worry about honestlyyt [sic]. And you\u2019re worried because you care \u2013 which is good thing\u2026 And the fact that people are wiling to donate to BeLeave instead of Vote Leave is something you should be very, very proud of.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, in an email sent on 16 May to Vote Leave\u2019s lawyer, Cleo Watson wrote: \u201c\u2026 Darren and the rest of the group (all between 18 & 22) don\u2019t feel comfortable handling the money side of things, having no experience beyond their student loans.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a stunning acknowledgment, one which raises more questions. This was Vote Leave\u2019s senior director and Vote Leave\u2019s head of compliance acknowledging that this was a group of young people without the experience or wherewithal to handle such a large sum of money. Watson told the Observer: \u201cI absolutely deny the claims being levelled against me.\u201d She said she was supportive as a friend but did not have \u201cany kind of control\u201d over them.\n\nThere\u2019s a heartbreaking contrast in the documents that Sanni has \u2013 between the cynicism that informed the funding scheme and the idealism that underpinned BeLeave\u2019s messages and beliefs (\u201cBeLeave is a movement of young people working to build a bright future for Britain outside the European Union,\u201d read the funding proposal document they submitted).\n\nAnd Grimes\u2019s fear that somehow he would mess up and jeopardise the cause is unmistakable: that it was too much responsibility; that he didn\u2019t feel up to it. Sanni repeatedly tells him, \u201cyou should be proud\u201d, and Grimes replies: \u201cI guess it is just worrying soemthing [sic] is gonna fuck up and it\u2019ll be me having to pay thousands back and end up homeless.\u201d We sent Darren Grimes a summary of the evidence we had found. He said any allegations he had done anything wrong were \u201cdamaging\u201d and \u201cuntrue\u201d.\n\nWhat has amazed me through all this is Sanni. When I met him in August, I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d come forward. I thought there was an outside chance he might leak me emails or documents, but I couldn\u2019t see him going on record. He\u2019s a Leaver: these are his friends and colleagues, they are people he looked up to.\n\n\u201cEveryone associated with the campaign knew who Darren was,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody congratulated us and knew what role we\u2019d played. Michael Gove knew exactly how important we\u2019d been. He\u2019s a close friend of Dom Cummings. Of course he knew. Boris Johnson knew. Everybody knew.\u201d\n\nAnd part of me worried about what would happen if he did go on the record. I worried that Christopher Wylie\u2019s decision to come forward last week might over-influence Sanni. That he\u2019d expose himself to risks he hadn\u2019t properly thought through. That at just 24, he couldn\u2019t really understand the possible consequences. But what I\u2019ve learned about Sanni in the past few months is how tough-minded he is. Coming to terms with the idea that he had been gulled and compromised by the people he respected, for the cause that he loved, has been painful and difficult. It was a process of months. But since he decided to come forward, he\u2019s been determined to do what he has no doubt is the right thing. His messages reveal how protective and supportive he\u2019s been of Darren Grimes. They\u2019re at the heart of his decision. But he has a sense of higher purpose too.\n\n\u201cI think I respect British laws more than most British people do,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel I respect this country and love this country more than some people who have been born and bred here. Because I know and I\u2019ve seen\u2026 the safety that it\u2019s brought me and my family, my sisters and my mother as a woman, as women that have potential and are now living their best lives.\u201d\n\nSanni doesn\u2019t go into detail about what they went through in Pakistan, but at one point he tells me that he has \u201chad a lot of trauma in my life\u201d. Nobody is making him come forward. And when he talks about his mother and sisters and the freedom they now enjoy, the hairs rise on the back of my neck. And then he tells me about queueing. It starts as a riff, but then it becomes a speech. A mission statement.\n\n\u201cThis is the one country where no matter what is happening, people will stand in a line. People here, there is a core ethos of what it means to be British: to do it right. To wait your turn. To never cheat or lie your way to get to the front. It\u2019s what it means to be British.\u201d\n\nSanni would still vote Leave. He just wants to do it properly. \u201cWe don\u2019t cheat,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re British.\u201d\n\nWhat will you do on Monday, I ask him. He still works for the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, co-founded by Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave\u2019s CEO. He has no other form of income. He shrugs. \u201cGo to work, I suppose. Wait and see what happens.\u201d\n\nLike us all.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Carole Cadwalladr", "body": "The first time I met Christopher Wylie, he didn\u2019t yet have pink hair. That comes later. As does his mission to rewind time. To put the genie back in the bottle.\n\nBy the time I met him in person, I\u2019d already been talking to him on a daily basis for hours at a time. On the phone, he was clever, funny, bitchy, profound, intellectually ravenous, compelling. A master storyteller. A politicker. A data science nerd.\n\nTwo months later, when he arrived in London from Canada, he was all those things in the flesh. And yet the flesh was impossibly young. He was 27 then (he\u2019s 28 now), a fact that has always seemed glaringly at odds with what he has done. He may have played a pivotal role in the momentous political upheavals of 2016. At the very least, he played a consequential role. At 24, he came up with an idea that led to the foundation of a company called Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm that went on to claim a major role in the Leave campaign for Britain\u2019s EU membership referendum, and later became a key figure in digital operations during Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign.\n\nOr, as Wylie describes it, he was the gay Canadian vegan who somehow ended up creating \u201cSteve Bannon\u2019s psychological warfare mindfuck tool\u201d.\n\nIn 2014, Steve Bannon \u2013 then executive chairman of the \u201calt-right\u201d news network Breitbart \u2013 was Wylie\u2019s boss. And Robert Mercer, the secretive US hedge-fund billionaire and Republican donor, was Cambridge Analytica\u2019s investor. And the idea they bought into was to bring big data and social media to an established military methodology \u2013 \u201cinformation operations\u201d \u2013 then turn it on the US electorate.\n\nIt was Wylie who came up with that idea and oversaw its realisation. And it was Wylie who, last spring, became my source. In May 2017, I wrote an article headlined \u201cThe great British Brexit robbery\u201d, which set out a skein of threads that linked Brexit to Trump to Russia. Wylie was one of a handful of individuals who provided the evidence behind it. I found him, via another Cambridge Analytica ex-employee, lying low in Canada: guilty, brooding, indignant, confused. \u201cI haven\u2019t talked about this to anyone,\u201d he said at the time. And then he couldn\u2019t stop talking.\n\nBy that time, Steve Bannon had become Trump\u2019s chief strategist. Cambridge Analytica\u2019s parent company, SCL, had won contracts with the US State Department and was pitching to the Pentagon, and Wylie was genuinely freaked out. \u201cIt\u2019s insane,\u201d he told me one night. \u201cThe company has created psychological profiles of 230 million Americans. And now they want to work with the Pentagon? It\u2019s like Nixon on steroids.\u201d\n\nHe ended up showing me a tranche of documents that laid out the secret workings behind Cambridge Analytica. And in the months following publication of my article in May, it was revealed that the company had \u201creached out\u201d to WikiLeaks to help distribute Hillary Clinton\u2019s stolen emails in 2016. And then we watched as it became a subject of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into possible Russian collusion in the US election.\n\nThe Observer also received the first of three letters from Cambridge Analytica threatening to sue Guardian News and Media for defamation. We are still only just starting to understand the maelstrom of forces that came together to create the conditions for what Mueller confirmed last month was \u201cinformation warfare\u201d. But Wylie offers a unique, worm\u2019s-eye view of the events of 2016. Of how Facebook was hijacked, repurposed to become a theatre of war: how it became a launchpad for what seems to be an extraordinary attack on the US\u2019s democratic process.\n\nWylie oversaw what may have been the first critical breach. Aged 24, while studying for a PhD in fashion trend forecasting, he came up with a plan to harvest the Facebook profiles of millions of people in the US, and to use their private and personal information to create sophisticated psychological and political profiles. And then target them with political ads designed to work on their particular psychological makeup.\n\nAnd he did it on behalf of his new boss, Steve Bannon.\n\n\u201cIs it fair to say you \u2018hacked\u2019 Facebook?\u201d I ask him one night.\n\nHe hesitates. \u201cI\u2019ll point out that I assumed it was entirely legal and above board.\u201d\n\nLast month, Facebook\u2019s UK director of policy, Simon Milner, told British MPs on a select committee inquiry into fake news, chaired by Conservative MP Damian Collins, that Cambridge Analytica did not have Facebook data. The official Hansard extract reads:\n\nChristian Matheson (MP for Chester): \u201cHave you ever passed any user information over to Cambridge Analytica or any of its associated companies?\u201d\n\nMatheson: \u201cBut they do hold a large chunk of Facebook\u2019s user data, don\u2019t they?\u201d\n\nMilner: \u201cNo. They may have lots of data, but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later, on 27 February, as part of the same parliamentary inquiry, Rebecca Pow, MP for Taunton Deane, asked Cambridge Analytica\u2019s CEO, Alexander Nix: \u201cDoes any of the data come from Facebook?\u201d Nix replied: \u201cWe do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.\u201d\n\nAnd through it all, Wylie and I, plus a handful of editors and a small, international group of academics and researchers, have known that \u2013 at least in 2014 \u2013 that certainly wasn\u2019t the case, because Wylie has the paper trail. In our first phone call, he told me he had the receipts, invoices, emails, legal letters \u2013 records that showed how, between June and August 2014, the profiles of more than 50 million Facebook users had been harvested. Most damning of all, he had a letter from Facebook\u2019s own lawyers admitting that Cambridge Analytica had acquired the data illegitimately.\n\nGoing public involves an enormous amount of risk. Wylie is breaking a non-disclosure agreement and risks being sued. He is breaking the confidence of Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer.\n\nIt\u2019s taken a rollercoaster of a year to help get Wylie to a place where it\u2019s possible for him to finally come forward. A year in which Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of investigations on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 Robert Mueller\u2019s in the US, and separate inquiries by the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office in the UK, both triggered in February 2017, after the Observer\u2019s first article in this investigation.\n\nIt has been a year, too, in which Wylie has been trying his best to rewind \u2013 to undo events that he set in motion. Earlier this month, he submitted a dossier of evidence to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office and the National Crime Agency\u2019s cybercrime unit. He is now in a position to go on the record: the data nerd who came in from the cold.\n\nThere are many points where this story could begin. One is in 2012, when Wylie was 21 and working for the Liberal Democrats in the UK, then in government as junior coalition partners. His career trajectory has been, like most aspects of his life so far, extraordinary, preposterous, implausible.\n\nWylie grew up in British Columbia and as a teenager he was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. He left school at 16 without a single qualification. Yet at 17, he was working in the office of the leader of the Canadian opposition; at 18, he went to learn all things data from Obama\u2019s national director of targeting, which he then introduced to Canada for the Liberal party. At 19, he taught himself to code, and in 2010, age 20, he came to London to study law at the London School of Economics.\n\n\u201cPolitics is like the mob, though,\u201d he says. \u201cYou never really leave. I got a call from the Lib Dems. They wanted to upgrade their databases and voter targeting. So, I combined working for them with studying for my degree.\u201d\n\nPolitics is also where he feels most comfortable. He hated school, but as an intern in the Canadian parliament he discovered a world where he could talk to adults and they would listen. He was the kid who did the internet stuff and within a year he was working for the leader of the opposition.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the brightest people you will ever meet,\u201d a senior politician who\u2019s known Wylie since he was 20 told me. \u201cSometimes that\u2019s a blessing and sometimes a curse.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, at Cambridge University\u2019s Psychometrics Centre, two psychologists, Michal Kosinski and David Stillwell, were experimenting with a way of studying personality \u2013 by quantifying it.\n\nStarting in 2007, Stillwell, while a student, had devised various apps for Facebook, one of which, a personality quiz called myPersonality, had gone viral. Users were scored on \u201cbig five\u201d personality traits \u2013 Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism \u2013 and in exchange, 40% of them consented to give him access to their Facebook profiles. Suddenly, there was a way of measuring personality traits across the population and correlating scores against Facebook \u201clikes\u201d across millions of people.\n\nThe research was original, groundbreaking and had obvious possibilities. \u201cThey had a lot of approaches from the security services,\u201d a member of the centre told me. \u201cThere was one called You Are What You Like and it was demonstrated to the intelligence services. And it showed these odd patterns; that, for example, people who liked \u2018I hate Israel\u2019 on Facebook also tended to like Nike shoes and KitKats.\n\n\u201cThere are agencies that fund research on behalf of the intelligence services. And they were all over this research. That one was nicknamed Operation KitKat.\u201d\n\nThe defence and military establishment were the first to see the potential of the research. Boeing, a major US defence contractor, funded Kosinski\u2019s PhD and Darpa, the US government\u2019s secretive Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, is cited in at least two academic papers supporting Kosinski\u2019s work.\n\nBut when, in 2013, the first major paper was published, others saw this potential too, including Wylie. He had finished his degree and had started his PhD in fashion forecasting, and was thinking about the Lib Dems. It is fair to say that he didn\u2019t have a clue what he was walking into.\n\n\u201cI wanted to know why the Lib Dems sucked at winning elections when they used to run the country up to the end of the 19th century,\u201d Wylie explains. \u201cAnd I began looking at consumer and demographic data to see what united Lib Dem voters, because apart from bits of Wales and the Shetlands it\u2019s weird, disparate regions. And what I found is there were no strong correlations. There was no signal in the data.\n\n\u201cAnd then I came across a paper about how personality traits could be a precursor to political behaviour, and it suddenly made sense. Liberalism is correlated with high openness and low conscientiousness, and when you think of Lib Dems they\u2019re absent-minded professors and hippies. They\u2019re the early adopters\u2026 they\u2019re highly open to new ideas. And it just clicked all of a sudden.\u201d\n\nHere was a way for the party to identify potential new voters. The only problem was that the Lib Dems weren\u2019t interested.\n\n\u201cI did this presentation at which I told them they would lose half their 57 seats, and they were like: \u2018Why are you so pessimistic?\u2019 They actually lost all but eight of their seats, FYI.\u201d\n\nAnother Lib Dem connection introduced Wylie to a company called SCL Group, one of whose subsidiaries, SCL Elections, would go on to create Cambridge Analytica (an incorporated venture between SCL Elections and Robert Mercer, funded by the latter). For all intents and purposes, SCL/Cambridge Analytica are one and the same.\n\nAlexander Nix, then CEO of SCL Elections, made Wylie an offer he couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cHe said: \u2018We\u2019ll give you total freedom. Experiment. Come and test out all your crazy ideas.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the history of bad ideas, this turned out to be one of the worst. The job was research director across the SCL group, a private contractor that has both defence and elections operations. Its defence arm was a contractor to the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence and the US\u2019s Department of Defense, among others. Its expertise was in \u201cpsychological operations\u201d \u2013 or psyops \u2013 changing people\u2019s minds not through persuasion but through \u201cinformational dominance\u201d, a set of techniques that includes rumour, disinformation and fake news.\n\nSCL Elections had used a similar suite of tools in more than 200 elections around the world, mostly in undeveloped democracies that Wylie would come to realise were unequipped to defend themselves.\n\nWylie holds a British Tier 1 Exceptional Talent visa \u2013 a UK work visa given to just 200 people a year. He was working inside government (with the Lib Dems) as a political strategist with advanced data science skills. But no one, least of all him, could have predicted what came next. When he turned up at SCL\u2019s offices in Mayfair, he had no clue that he was walking into the middle of a nexus of defence and intelligence projects, private contractors and cutting-edge cyberweaponry.\n\n\u201cThe thing I think about all the time is, what if I\u2019d taken a job at Deloitte instead? They offered me one. I just think if I\u2019d taken literally any other job, Cambridge Analytica wouldn\u2019t exist. You have no idea how much I brood on this.\u201d\n\nA few months later, in autumn 2013, Wylie met Steve Bannon. At the time, he was editor-in-chief of Breitbart, which he had brought to Britain to support his friend Nigel Farage in his mission to take Britain out of the European Union.\n\nWhat was he like?\n\n\u201cSmart,\u201d says Wylie. \u201cInteresting. Really interested in ideas. He\u2019s the only straight man I\u2019ve ever talked to about intersectional feminist theory. He saw its relevance straightaway to the oppressions that conservative, young white men feel.\u201d\n\nWylie meeting Bannon was the moment petrol was poured on a flickering flame. Wylie lives for ideas. He speaks 19 to the dozen for hours at a time. He had a theory to prove. And at the time, this was a purely intellectual problem. Politics was like fashion, he told Bannon.\n\n\u201c[Bannon] got it immediately. He believes in the whole Andrew Breitbart doctrine that politics is downstream from culture, so to change politics you need to change culture. And fashion trends are a useful proxy for that. Trump is like a pair of Uggs, or Crocs, basically. So how do you get from people thinking \u2018Ugh. Totally ugly\u2019 to the moment when everyone is wearing them? That was the inflection point he was looking for.\u201d\n\nBut Wylie wasn\u2019t just talking about fashion. He had recently been exposed to a new discipline: \u201cinformation operations\u201d, which ranks alongside land, sea, air and space in the US military\u2019s doctrine of the \u201cfive-dimensional battle space\u201d. His brief ranged across the SCL Group \u2013 the British government has paid SCL to conduct counter-extremism operations in the Middle East, and the US Department of Defense has contracted it to work in Afghanistan.\n\nI tell him that another former employee described the firm as \u201cMI6 for hire\u201d, and I\u2019d never quite understood it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like dirty MI6 because you\u2019re not constrained. There\u2019s no having to go to a judge to apply for permission. It\u2019s normal for a \u2018market research company\u2019 to amass data on domestic populations. And if you\u2019re working in some country and there\u2019s an auxiliary benefit to a current client with aligned interests, well that\u2019s just a bonus.\u201d\n\nWhen I ask how Bannon even found SCL, Wylie tells me what sounds like a tall tale, though it\u2019s one he can back up with an email about how Mark Block, a veteran Republican strategist, happened to sit next to a cyberwarfare expert for the US air force on a plane. \u201cAnd the cyberwarfare guy is like, \u2018Oh, you should meet SCL. They do cyberwarfare for elections.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was Bannon who took this idea to the Mercers: Robert Mercer \u2013 the co-CEO of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, who used his billions to pursue a rightwing agenda, donating to Republican causes and supporting Republican candidates \u2013 and his daughter Rebekah.\n\nNix and Wylie flew to New York to meet the Mercers in Rebekah\u2019s Manhattan apartment.\n\n\u201cShe loved me. She was like, \u2018Oh we need more of your type on our side!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe gays. She loved the gays. So did Steve [Bannon]. He saw us as early adopters. He figured, if you can get the gays on board, everyone else will follow. It\u2019s why he was so into the whole Milo [Yiannopoulos] thing.\u201d\n\nRobert Mercer was a pioneer in AI and machine translation. He helped invent algorithmic trading \u2013 which replaced hedge fund managers with computer programs \u2013 and he listened to Wylie\u2019s pitch. It was for a new kind of political message-targeting based on an influential and groundbreaking 2014 paper researched at Cambridge\u2019s Psychometrics Centre, called: \u201cComputer-based personality judgments are more accurate than those made by humans\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn politics, the money man is usually the dumbest person in the room. Whereas it\u2019s the opposite way around with Mercer,\u201d says Wylie. \u201cHe said very little, but he really listened. He wanted to understand the science. And he wanted proof that it worked.\u201d\n\nAnd to do that, Wylie needed data.\n\nHow Cambridge Analytica acquired the data has been the subject of internal reviews at Cambridge University, of many news articles and much speculation and rumour.\n\nWhen Nix was interviewed by MPs last month, Damian Collins asked him:\n\n\u201cDoes any of your data come from Global Science Research company?\u201d\n\nNix: \u201cWe had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.\u201d\n\nCollins: \u201cThey have not supplied you with data or information?\u201d\n\nCollins: \u201cYour datasets are not based on information you have received from them?\u201d\n\nThe problem with Nix\u2019s response to Collins is that Wylie has a copy of an executed contract, dated 4 June 2014, which confirms that SCL, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with a company called Global Science Research (GSR), owned by Cambridge-based academic Aleksandr Kogan, specifically premised on the harvesting and processing of Facebook data, so that it could be matched to personality traits and voter rolls.\n\nHe has receipts showing that Cambridge Analytica spent $7m to amass this data, about $1m of it with GSR. He has the bank records and wire transfers. Emails reveal Wylie first negotiated with Michal Kosinski, one of the co-authors of the original myPersonality research paper, to use the myPersonality database. But when negotiations broke down, another psychologist, Aleksandr Kogan, offered a solution that many of his colleagues considered unethical. He offered to replicate Kosinski and Stilwell\u2019s research and cut them out of the deal. For Wylie it seemed a perfect solution. \u201cKosinski was asking for $500,000 for the IP but Kogan said he could replicate it and just harvest his own set of data.\u201d (Kosinski says the fee was to fund further research.)\n\nKogan then set up GSR to do the work, and proposed to Wylie they use the data to set up an interdisciplinary institute working across the social sciences. \u201cWhat happened to that idea,\u201d I ask Wylie. \u201cIt never happened. I don\u2019t know why. That\u2019s one of the things that upsets me the most.\u201d\n\nIt was Bannon\u2019s interest in culture as war that ignited Wylie\u2019s intellectual concept. But it was Robert Mercer\u2019s millions that created a firestorm. Kogan was able to throw money at the hard problem of acquiring personal data: he advertised for people who were willing to be paid to take a personality quiz on Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk and Qualtrics. At the end of which Kogan\u2019s app, called thisismydigitallife, gave him permission to access their Facebook profiles. And not just theirs, but their friends\u2019 too. On average, each \u201cseeder\u201d \u2013 the people who had taken the personality test, around 320,000 in total \u2013 unwittingly gave access to at least 160 other people\u2019s profiles, none of whom would have known or had reason to suspect.\n\nWhat the email correspondence between Cambridge Analytica employees and Kogan shows is that Kogan had collected millions of profiles in a matter of weeks. But neither Wylie nor anyone else at Cambridge Analytica had checked that it was legal. It certainly wasn\u2019t authorised. Kogan did have permission to pull Facebook data, but for academic purposes only. What\u2019s more, under British data protection laws, it\u2019s illegal for personal data to be sold to a third party without consent.\n\n\u201cFacebook could see it was happening,\u201d says Wylie. \u201cTheir security protocols were triggered because Kogan\u2019s apps were pulling this enormous amount of data, but apparently Kogan told them it was for academic use. So they were like, \u2018Fine\u2019.\u201d\n\nKogan maintains that everything he did was legal and he had a \u201cclose working relationship\u201d with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.\n\nCambridge Analytica had its data. This was the foundation of everything it did next \u2013 how it extracted psychological insights from the \u201cseeders\u201d and then built an algorithm to profile millions more.\n\nFor more than a year, the reporting around what Cambridge Analytica did or didn\u2019t do for Trump has revolved around the question of \u201cpsychographics\u201d, but Wylie points out: \u201cEverything was built on the back of that data. The models, the algorithm. Everything. Why wouldn\u2019t you use it in your biggest campaign ever?\u201d\n\nIn December 2015, the Guardian\u2019s Harry Davies published the first report about Cambridge Analytica acquiring Facebook data and using it to support Ted Cruz in his campaign to be the US Republican candidate. But it wasn\u2019t until many months later that Facebook took action. And then, all they did was write a letter. In August 2016, shortly before the US election, and two years after the breach took place, Facebook\u2019s lawyers wrote to Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, and told him the data had been illicitly obtained and that \u201cGSR was not authorised to share or sell it\u201d. They said it must be deleted immediately.\n\n\u201cI already had. But literally all I had to do was tick a box and sign it and send it back, and that was it,\u201d says Wylie. \u201cFacebook made zero effort to get the data back.\u201d\n\nThere were multiple copies of it. It had been emailed in unencrypted files.\n\nCambridge Analytica rejected all allegations the Observer put to them.\n\nDr Kogan \u2013 who later changed his name to Dr Spectre, but has subsequently changed it back to Dr Kogan \u2013 is still a faculty member at Cambridge University, a senior research associate. But what his fellow academics didn\u2019t know until Kogan revealed it in emails to the Observer (although Cambridge University says that Kogan told the head of the psychology department), is that he is also an associate professor at St Petersburg University. Further research revealed that he\u2019s received grants from the Russian government to research \u201cStress, health and psychological wellbeing in social networks\u201d. The opportunity came about on a trip to the city to visit friends and family, he said.\n\nThere are other dramatic documents in Wylie\u2019s stash, including a pitch made by Cambridge Analytica to Lukoil, Russia\u2019s second biggest oil producer. In an email dated 17 July 2014, about the US presidential primaries, Nix wrote to Wylie: \u201cWe have been asked to write a memo to Lukoil (the Russian oil and gas company) to explain to them how our services are going to apply to the petroleum business. Nix said that \u201cthey understand behavioural microtargeting in the context of elections\u201d but that they were \u201cfailing to make the connection between voters and their consumers\u201d. The work, he said, would be \u201cshared with the CEO of the business\u201d, a former Soviet oil minister and associate of Putin, Vagit Alekperov.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t make any sense to me,\u201d says Wylie. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand either the email or the pitch presentation we did. Why would a Russian oil company want to target information on American voters?\u201d\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation traces the first stages of the Russian operation to disrupt the 2016 US election back to 2014, when the Russian state made what appears to be its first concerted efforts to harness the power of America\u2019s social media platforms, including Facebook. And it was in late summer of the same year that Cambridge Analytica presented the Russian oil company with an outline of its datasets, capabilities and methodology. The presentation had little to do with \u201cconsumers\u201d. Instead, documents show it focused on election disruption techniques. The first slide illustrates how a \u201crumour campaign\u201d spread fear in the 2007 Nigerian election \u2013 in which the company worked \u2013 by spreading the idea that the \u201celection would be rigged\u201d. The final slide, branded with Lukoil\u2019s logo and that of SCL Group and SCL Elections, headlines its \u201cdeliverables\u201d: \u201cpsychographic messaging\u201d.\n\nLukoil is a private company, but its CEO, Alekperov, answers to Putin, and it\u2019s been used as a vehicle of Russian influence in Europe and elsewhere \u2013 including in the Czech Republic, where in 2016 it was revealed that an adviser to the strongly pro-Russian Czech president was being paid by the company.\n\nWhen I asked Bill Browder \u2013 an Anglo-American businessman who is leading a global campaign for a Magnitsky Act to enforce sanctions against Russian individuals \u2013 what he made of it, he said: \u201cEveryone in Russia is subordinate to Putin. One should be highly suspicious of any Russian company pitching anything outside its normal business activities.\u201d\n\nLast month, Nix told MPs on the parliamentary committee investigating fake news: \u201cWe have never worked with a Russian organisation in Russia or any other company. We do not have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that Cambridge Analytica ever did any work for Lukoil. What these documents show, though, is that in 2014 one of Russia\u2019s biggest companies was fully briefed on: Facebook, microtargeting, data, election disruption.\n\nCambridge Analytica is \u201cChris\u2019s Frankenstein\u201d, says a friend of his. \u201cHe created it. It\u2019s his data Frankenmonster. And now he\u2019s trying to put it right.\u201d\n\nOnly once has Wylie made the case of pointing out that he was 24 at the time. But he was. He thrilled to the intellectual possibilities of it. He didn\u2019t think of the consequences. And I wonder how much he\u2019s processed his own role or responsibility in it. Instead, he\u2019s determined to go on the record and undo this thing he has created.\n\nBecause the past few months have been like watching a tornado gathering force. And when Wylie turns the full force of his attention to something \u2013 his strategic brain, his attention to detail, his ability to plan 12 moves ahead \u2013 it is sometimes slightly terrifying to behold. Dealing with someone trained in information warfare has its own particular challenges, and his suite of extraordinary talents include the kind of high-level political skills that makes House of Cards look like The Great British Bake Off. And not everyone\u2019s a fan. Any number of ex-colleagues \u2013 even the ones who love him \u2013 call him \u201cMachiavellian\u201d. Another described the screaming matches he and Nix would have.\n\n\u201cWhat do your parents make of your decision to come forward?\u201d I ask him.\n\n\u201cThey get it. My dad sent me a cartoon today, which had two characters hanging off a cliff, and the first one\u2019s saying \u2018Hang in there.\u2019 And the other is like: \u2018Fuck you.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhich are you?\n\nWhat isn\u2019t in doubt is what a long, fraught journey it has been to get to this stage. And how fearless he is.\n\nAfter many months, I learn the terrible, dark backstory that throws some light on his determination, and which he discusses candidly. At six, while at school, Wylie was abused by a mentally unstable person. The school tried to cover it up, blaming his parents, and a long court battle followed. Wylie\u2019s childhood and school career never recovered. His parents \u2013 his father is a doctor and his mother is a psychiatrist \u2013 were wonderful, he says. \u201cBut they knew the trajectory of people who are put in that situation, so I think it was particularly difficult for them, because they had a deeper understanding of what that does to a person long term.\u201d\n\nHe says he grew up listening to psychologists discuss him in the third person, and, aged 14, he successfully sued the Canadian Ministry of Education and forced it to change its inclusion policies around bullying. What I observe now is how much he loves the law, lawyers, precision, order. I come to think of his pink hair as a false-flag operation. What he cannot tolerate is bullying.\n\nIs what Cambridge Analytica does akin to bullying?\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s worse than bullying,\u201d Wylie says. \u201cBecause people don\u2019t necessarily know it\u2019s being done to them. At least bullying respects the agency of people because they know. So it\u2019s worse, because if you do not respect the agency of people, anything that you\u2019re doing after that point is not conducive to a democracy. And fundamentally, information warfare is not conducive to democracy.\u201d\n\nRussia, Facebook, Trump, Mercer, Bannon, Brexit. Every one of these threads runs through Cambridge Analytica. Even in the past few weeks, it seems as if the understanding of Facebook\u2019s role has broadened and deepened. The Mueller indictments were part of that, but Paul-Olivier Dehaye \u2013 a data expert and academic based in Switzerland, who published some of the first research into Cambridge Analytica\u2019s processes \u2013 says it\u2019s become increasingly apparent that Facebook is \u201cabusive by design\u201d. If there is evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, it will be in the platform\u2019s data flows, he says. And Wylie\u2019s revelations only move it on again.\n\n\u201cFacebook has denied and denied and denied this,\u201d Dehaye says when told of the Observer\u2019s new evidence. \u201cIt has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it\u2019s failed in its duties to respect the law.It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn\u2019t. It\u2019s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.\u201d\n\nFacebook denies that the data transfer was a breach. In addition, a spokesperson said: \u201cProtecting people\u2019s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, it\u2019s a serious abuse of our rules. Both Aleksandr Kogan as well as the SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.\u201d\n\nMillions of people\u2019s personal information was stolen and used to target them in ways they wouldn\u2019t have seen, and couldn\u2019t have known about, by a mercenary outfit, Cambridge Analytica, who, Wylie says, \u201cwould work for anyone\u201d. Who would pitch to Russian oil companies. Would they subvert elections abroad on behalf of foreign governments?\n\nIt occurs to me to ask Wylie this one night.\n\n\u201cEither. I mean they\u2019re mercenaries. They\u2019ll work for pretty much anyone who pays.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an incredible revelation. It also encapsulates all of the problems of outsourcing \u2013 at a global scale, with added cyberweapons. And in the middle of it all are the public \u2013 our intimate family connections, our \u201clikes\u201d, our crumbs of personal data, all sucked into a swirling black hole that\u2019s expanding and growing and is now owned by a politically motivated billionaire.\n\nThe Facebook data is out in the wild. And for all Wylie\u2019s efforts, there\u2019s no turning the clock back.\n\nTamsin Shaw, a philosophy professor at New York University, and the author of a recent New York Review of Books article on cyberwar and the Silicon Valley economy, told me that she\u2019d pointed to the possibility of private contractors obtaining cyberweapons that had at least been in part funded by US defence.\n\nShe calls Wylie\u2019s disclosures \u201cwild\u201d and points out that \u201cthe whole Facebook project\u201d has only been allowed to become as vast and powerful as it has because of the US national security establishment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a form of very deep but soft power that\u2019s been seen as an asset for the US. Russia has been so explicit about this, paying for the ads in roubles and so on. It\u2019s making this point, isn\u2019t it? That Silicon Valley is a US national security asset that they\u2019ve turned on itself.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Carole Cadwalladr", "body": "A whistleblower who worked for the official Vote Leave campaign has broken cover to raise concerns that the masterminds behind the 2016 vote \u2013 including key figures now working for Theresa May in Downing Street \u2013 may have flouted referendum spending rules and then attempted to destroy evidence.\n\nThe allegations, from former volunteer Shahmir Sanni, are detailed in an interview in the Observer and supported by a mass of documents and files that he has passed to the Electoral Commission and the police.\n\nSanni\u2019s central claim concerns a donation of \u00a3625,000 that Vote Leave ostensibly made to an independent referendum campaign organisation called BeLeave. He claims the money, channelled to a digital services firm linked to the controversial Cambridge Analytica firm, violated election rules because it was not a genuine donation.\n\nThe money was registered by BeLeave with election authorities as a donation from Vote Leave to an independent youth operation. Sanni says BeLeave shared offices with Vote Leave \u2013 fronted by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove \u2013 which in practice offered advice and assistance to the group and helped them to decide where their cash would be spent.\n\nElectoral law prohibits co-ordination between different campaign organisations, which must all comply with spending limits. If they plan tactics or co-ordinate together, they must have a shared cap on spending. Vote Leave strongly denies any such co-ordination.\n\nSanni says that after the commission opened an investigation last March, Victoria Woodcock, the operations director for Vote Leave, deleted herself, campaign director Dominic Cummings and Vote Leave\u2019s digital director, Henry de Zoete, from dozens of files on the drive Vote Leave shared with BeLeave to hide the fact of co-ordination. On a blog post on Friday, Cummings said this was \u201cfactually wrong and libellous\u201d. Vote Leave say staff acted \u201cethically, responsibly and legally in deleting any data\u201d.\n\nMost of the \u00a3625,000 donation went to a Canadian data company called AggregateIQ, which has links to Cambridge Analytica, the firm that used harvested Facebook data to build a political targeting system in the US. Christopher Wylie, the former CA employee turned whistleblower, said that at the time of the referendum, the Canadian firm was operating \u201calmost as an internal department of Cambridge Analytica\u201d.\n\nAIQ would eventually soak up about a third of all Vote Leave\u2019s official spending, receiving \u00a32.7m from the group in addition to the money that came via BeLeave. The firm also received \u00a3100,000 from Veterans for Britain and \u00a332,750 from the DUP. After the referendum, Cummings stated on AIQ\u2019s website: \u201cWithout a doubt, the Vote Leave campaign owes a great deal of its success to the work of Aggregate IQ. We couldn\u2019t have done it without them.\u201d\n\nOther senior figures in Vote Leave included Stephen Parkinson, now Theresa May\u2019s chief adviser. Parkinson said in a statement: \u201cI am clear that I did not direct the activities of any separate campaign groups. I had no responsibility for digital campaigning or donations during the referendum and am confident that Vote Leave acted entirely within the law and strict spending rules at all times\u201d.\n\nSanni, who was treasurer and secretary of BeLeave at 22, is still a committed Eurosceptic and works for Matthew Elliott today at his TaxPayers \u2018Alliance campaign group. He says he decided to go public because he did not want Brexit to be tainted by possibly illegal activities.\n\nHe was also alarmed by the fact that his friend, Darren Grimes, the former head of the BeLeave youth group, is a focus of an Electoral Commission investigation into breaches of spending limits.\n\nSanni said Vote Leave \u201cdidn\u2019t really give us that money. They just pretended to. We had no control over it.\u201d\n\nHe believes Vote Leave\u2019s senior officials may have taken advantage of the group\u2019s youth and the political inexperience of Grimes to ramp up their own spending. He emphasises BeLeave was a small Brexit-supporting outreach group run by twenty-somethings with no real experience or background in campaigning or finance.\n\nHe says that it was helped by Vote Leave staff to set up its own constitution and bank account so that it could accept donations of its own. Vote Leave\u2019s lawyers did the legal documentation, he said.\n\n\u201cWe were advised every step of the way by Vote Leave\u2019s lawyers. They told us what to do and where to sign.\u201d\n\nThe payment to AIQ was ostensibly made by BeLeave as the referendum campaign drew to a close. But Sanni claims BeLeave didn\u2019t have any choice about where the cash would be spent, didn\u2019t sign a contract with AIQ, and did not direct what the data firm did with the funds. The money never even passed through the group\u2019s own bank account.\n\n\u201cThere was no contract in front of me, as treasurer and secretary,\u201d Sanni said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any contract.\u201d This process was repeated with a further \u00a350,000, from an outside donor.\n\nVote Leave said: \u201cIt was Darren\u2019s decision to hire AIQ, agreed with and confirmed by Shamir Sanni.\u201d\n\nVenner Shipley, Vote Leave\u2019s lawyers, said: \u201cWe have never been instructed by, nor have we ever provided advice to BeLeave.\u201d\n\nSanni has shared emails with the Observer and the authorities which appear to show the young campaigners seeking advice from top Vote Leave figures, an invoice to VoteLeave covering work on the BeLeave campaign and messages from Vote Leave lawyers and accountants about the practicalities of establishing it as an independent group.\n\nSanni explained that Vote Leave also set up and managed a shared BeLeave computer drive with the youth campaign\u2019s messaging, information and other documents.\n\nThe emails reveal other senior figures were in regular contact with BeLeave. Cleo Watson, who was head of outreach for Vote Leave and is now a political adviser alongside Parkinson in Downing street, was in touch with the organisation and was a member of a closed Facebook group for BeLeave contributors. In a statement to the Observer, Watson said: \u201cI absolutely deny the claims being levelled against me.\u201d\n\nThis weekend Parkinson was at the centre of a political storm after revealing in a statement delivered without Sanni\u2019s consent that they dated each other for a year and a half, including the period when Parkinson was at Vote Leave and Sanni worked as a volunteer.\n\nParkinson said he only gave Sanni advice and guidance in the context of that relationship. In a statement released on Friday night, lawyers for Sanni said: \u201cWe believe this is the first time a Downing Street official statement has been used to out someone. My client is now having to come out to his mother and family ... and members of his family are being forced to take urgent protective measures to ensure their safety.\u201d\n\nIn one email to Vote Leave\u2019s lawyer, Watson acknowledged that BeLeave did not have the experience needed to handle the funds that would be spent in their name, stating: \u201cDarren and the rest of the group (all between 18 & 22) don\u2019t feel comfortable handling the money side of things, having no experience beyond their student loans.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to the Observer, Watson said: \u201cTo imply that being supportive of their work was to have any kind of control over their activities is absolutely untrue.\u201d\n\nWoodcock, the operations director for Vote Leave, has been described by Cummings as \u201cthe most indispensible person in the campaign\u201d. The documents provided by Sanni suggest that after the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office last year announced an inquiry into how the different campaigns used personal data, she deleted key Vote Leave names, including her own, from dozens of files on the shared BeLeave drive.\n\nWoodcock told the Observer yesterday: \u2018The gist of those allegations is that I knowingly and deliberately deleted evidence which would be relevant to an investigation in an attempt to frustrate it. I believe that is untrue and completely unsupported by the evidence.\u201d\n\nCummings said: \u201cThe allegations about illegal donations to BeLeave are false and are part of a campaign to cancel the referendum result.\u201d\n\nFurther evidence of contact between senior figures at Vote Leave and BeLeave during the referendum came in a witness statement from Elliott, the campaign chief, which was submitted to the High Court on March 13, 2018 as part of a judicial review.\n\n\u201cI can confirm distinct campaigns were run,\u201d Elliot says, who added that he was including some examples of BeLeave publicity work to help clarify details. \u201cI thought it may assist the Court in having examples of the campaign material used by the different campaigns and I attach those.\u201d\n\nA photograph attached shows a group of young people \u2013 including Grimes \u2013 beneath the BeLeave logo. But emails detail how on March 18, 2016, it was Cleo Watson who organised that photoshoot. In another email from March 22, it was Stephen Parkinson who signed off on the logo.\n\nn February 2016, a leaked email from prominent Brexit supporter, Steve Baker, now a junior minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union, floated the idea of creating \u201cseparate legal entities each of which could spend \u00a3700,000\u201d.\n\nSanni believes this is exactly what happened with BeLeave. \u201cThroughout this whole process Darren and I were victims to very intelligent people trying to find ways to overspend.\u201d Sanni said.

One of his friends, the newspaper editor Damian Kudryavtsev, posted the news on his Facebook page.\n\nIn the 1990s, Glushkov worked for the state airline Aeroflot and Berezovsky\u2019s LogoVAZ car company. In 1999, as Berezovsky fell out with Putin and fled to the UK, Glushkov was charged with money laundering and fraud. He spent five years in jail and was freed in 2004.\n\nIn recent years, Glushkov had lived in London, where he received political asylum. In 2011, he gave evidence at the court case brought by Berezovsky against his fellow oligarch Roman Abramovich, who remained on good terms with the Kremlin.\n\nBerezovsky accused Abramovich of cheating him out of $5bn (\u00a33.2bn) and claimed they had been partners in the 1990s in an oil firm, Sibneft.

The number of incidents were found to have risen sharply, with 388 attacks recorded in 2017 compared with 290 the previous year.\n\nThe research focused on attacks against activists involved in protests against corporate activities. Victims included unionists, protests, whistleblowers and indigenous communities.\n\nLand rights defenders and activists linked to the mining, agribusiness and renewable energy sectors were found to be in greatest danger. The researchers also highlighted an increased risk to lawyers, and to members of human rights and environmental civil society organisations working for corporate accountability.\n\n\n\nIn 42% of harassment cases, judicial intimidation was used in an attempt to suppress protests against business activities. This included arbitrary detention, criminalisation and aggressive lawsuits.\n\n\n\nThe Business and Human Rights Center found that companies involved in mining, agriculture, energy and construction \u2013 particularly those headquartered in the UK, US, China, Canada and France \u2013 were the most likely to use legal means in an attempt to prevent human rights protests.\n\n\u201cOur research highlights that companies do play a significant role in attacks on human rights defenders \u2013 the first time that this data has been systematically collected,\u201d said Ana Zbona from the Business and Human Rights Resource Center.\n\nThe researchers found that human rights defenders raising concerns about business operations are often criminalised on fabricated charges.

But we have to not lose our vision as to where we want to go as a country. We can talk about the disastrous role Russia has played in trying to undermine American democracy. That is enormously important. But we also have to talk about the fact that we have the highest rate of child poverty in any major economy of the world.\u201d\n\nThe event was streamed online by liberal video outlets \u2013 including NowThis, The Young Turks and Act.tv. The Guardian was a media partner for the event, which follows a similar town hall Sanders organized in January on universal healthcare.\n\n\n\nSanders and Moore both complained about the media\u2019s poor coverage of inequality and working people\u2019s struggles.

What an inspiration that would be. But they don\u2019t show this, Bernie, because, what would happen if they did?\u201d\n\nPanelists were not shy to point out who they felt were the culprits fuelling inequality in the United States. Its three wealthiest men \u2013 Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Warren Buffet \u2013 who collectively earn more than the poorest half of Americans, were singled out as contributing to the widening wealth gap. So too were lobbyists like the American Legislative Exchange Council and major political donors such as the Koch brothers. And, of course, representatives in Congress who are beholden to corporate donors. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhether the representatives are Democrats or Republicans, they go for the money. How do you fight that?\u201d asked Moore. Speaking of Democratic donors, Moore tickled the audience with a story about a red carpet run-in with a Goldman Sachs executive at the Oscars. \u201cThe CEO of Goldman Sachs said \u2018Why are you attacking us? We are Democrats\u2019.\u201d That, Moore suggested, was part of the problem.\n\n\u201cWe need a party that\u2019s going to be there for the people, the working people \u2026 We need to challenge people on our own side of the fence to stand up and do their job for the working people of this country,\u201d Moore said.\n\nSpeaking about the need to inspire voters, he added: \u201cThe biggest party is the non-voters\u2019 party.\u201d He rejected the notion that non-voters were apathetic, saying that skipping the polls was an \u201can act of civil disobedience\u201d. He added: \u201cThey aren\u2019t going to vote, unless you give them a reason to vote.\u201d\n\nThe panelists were keen to highlight solutions to rising inequality, and almost all agreed on the importance of strong unions.\n\n\u201cUnions built America\u2019s middle class. It will take unions to rebuild America\u2019s middle class,\u201d said Warren, to thunderous applause.\n\n\n\nThe need for progressive taxation was also stressed. Speaking about lobbying efforts behind the recent tax cuts, she added: \u201cWe have to call it out for what it is: corruption. This is an organized effort to take over our government, and make the government work better and better for a thinner and thinner slice of America.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian, Sanders also warned about the growing concentration of corporate power. \u201cWhen you have companies like Amazon that have extraordinary power, when you have companies like Facebook that to a significant degree control discourse, am I concerned about monopoly power? Absolutely. We need to have the kind of discussion that Congress has not had yet.\u201d\n\nWhile Sanders doesn\u2019t agree with President Trump\u2019s tariffs, he said that they are a \u201cweapon you can use\u201d to address competitors from low-wage countries. \u201cAmerican workers are put in an extreme disadvantage in that kind of competition,\u201d Sanders said, adding: \u201cWe have to go broader [than Trump\u2019s tariffs]. I have called for the ending of permanent normal trade relations with China and Nafta. I think trade is a positive thing, but it has to be done in a way that is fair.\u201d\n\nTrump was barely mentioned during the event, but there was one rapturous moment when his name came up. Moore, quoting a Democratic candidate running in Michigan, said: \u201cIn this election you are not electing a member to the House of Representatives, you are electing a jury for the impeachment of Donald J Trump. Never forget that over these next few months.\u201d\n\nBut Moore was quick to bring the audience back to the challenge at hand. \u201cWith that in mind, I want to make this clear ... If we just get rid of Trump, and return to what it was like the day before Trump, how were things then? With healthcare? With poverty? We have to move forward.

She denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\n\nMany of the people photographed appeared to be state employees: Sklyarevskaya was identified by a colleague as a hospital deputy director of health and safety.\n\nSklyarevskaya arrived to vote with a group of eight other women and one man through the gates of polling station 216. About 20 minutes later, the same group were observed voting again a few hundred metres away at polling station 215.\n\nApproached about the incident, Sklyarevskaya said she had voted only once, at a third polling station, number 217. \u201cWho directed you to do this investigation?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou do not have the right to get involved in the electoral system.\u201d\n\nOfficial results released on Monday showed the three polling stations in Ust-Djeguta had an average turnout of 81.5% and delivered a majority for Putin of 89.86%. National turnout was 67%, according to the central election commission.\n\nAt polling station number 216, a count revealed there were not enough ballot papers to tally with the figure for Putin votes \u2013 1,299 \u2013 that officials had provisionally pencilled in. When a recount produced the same outcome, the election officials said they were going home.\n\nWhen Reuters reporters asked how the officials could go home at that point, the director of the school hosting the polling station said: \u201cYou want to cast doubt on Putin\u2019s victory?\u201d\n\nA Kremlin spokesman responding to the allegations said: \u201cIf these reports from the respected Reuters agency are backed up by corresponding statements to law enforcement agencies from the observers who were at each polling station, then it\u2019s a worry. If they are not backed up, then it does not worry us at all.\u201d \n\n\n\nReuters reporters also used mechanical counters to count everybody who cast a ballot at 12 polling stations. In some places, the discrepancies between the official count and the Reuters tally were small, but in nine of the 12 polling stations the discrepancies were 10% or greater. \n\n\n\nIn the 2016 Russian parliamentary elections, Reuters carried out a similar exercise. On that occasion, among turnout discrepancies, a Reuters reporter who had cast a ballot for a party other than Putin\u2019s United Russia found that no vote for that party had been recorded at that polling station.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Paul Lewis", "body": "It was the summer of 2007. Brittany Kaiser was not yet 21, but she was one of a handful of full-time workers in the small digital team for Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign, uploading photos of the Illinois senator to something called a Facebook page.\n\nAt the next desk was another activist who knew a bit about the social media startup. Chris Hughes, 24, had worked with his Harvard roommate Mark Zuckerberg to create Facebook as a tool for students a few years earlier.\n\nA decade later, the picture has darkened, as Hughes recently lamented when he complained about the \u201cnegative role\u201d Facebook is playing in politics.\n\nAnd Kaiser, who until two weeks ago was a senior employee at Cambridge Analytica, has worked for a company involved in two of the most negative and controversial campaigns in history.\n\nNow she wants to make those secrets public, becoming the second former Cambridge Analytica employee to come forward in less than a week.\n\nHer motive for doing so is likely to come under scrutiny: this has been a catastrophic week for the firm \u2013 and Kaiser was a senior executive. She claims, however, that it is because she wants to stop telling lies.\n\nIt seems remarkable that an Obama volunteer who studied human rights and voted for Bernie Sanders ended up working for a controversial data analytics company at the centre of a global story about the use of data and dirty tricks.\n\nThe company\u2019s work on Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign left her feeling \u201cincredibly internally conflicted\u201d, but she insists she was only doing her job; her political views have nothing to do with her decision to reveal secrets about Cambridge Analytica.\n\nAsked why she has decided to speak out, Kaiser flares: \u201cWhy should we make excuses for these people? Why? I\u2019m so tired of making excuses for old white men. Fucking hell.\u201d\n\nShe says she believes that Silicon Valley has much to answer for. \u201cThere\u2019s a much wider story that I think needs to be told about how people can protect themselves, and their own data.\u201d\n\nHer disclosures come almost a week after the Observer revealed new information on how data was acquired from more than 50 million Facebook friends without their consent.\n\nKaiser has less to say on the harvesting of this data in 2014 than she does on other issues, which is corroborated by emails, correspondence and other documents reviewed by the Guardian.\n\nHer own journey \u2013 from Obama\u2019s campaign to trying to secure business with political parties and corporate interests in Ethiopia, Lithuania, Romania, Nigeria and Zambia; and from Occupy to Trump\u2019s presidential victory party \u2013 says much about the bizarre state of politics in the digital era.\n\nFacebook was not all Kaiser and Hughes had in common when they met at Obama\u2019s Chicago HQ; they had attended the same prestigious private school in Massachusetts. Now they were among fewer than a dozen Obama activists and volunteers on the \u201cnew media\u201d team.\n\nHughes, though, stood apart. He was apparently still able to pull strings at Facebook, which had relocated to California. When the campaign noticed problematic things about the social media site, such as the deluge of racist and abusive material being posted on the senator\u2019s \u201cwall\u201d, Hughes, it seems, could find a solution.\n\nOn that occasion, Kaiser says, the platform was changed so that campaign workers could pre-approve messages before they appeared.\n\nAnother leap forward for Obama 2008\u2019s Facebook experiment was their response to the avalanche of \u201cfriend\u201d requests tying up campaign resources, with volunteers having to check photos. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want a media controversy around Barack Obama being friends with somebody that was naked with an assault rifle,\u201d she says.\n\nThe solution was a change that meant fans could \u201cfollow\u201d Obama\u2019s campaign rather than request a \u201cfriend connection\u201d.\n\nFor the next few years, Kaiser says, her career diverged from US politics: she was a marketing officer for London\u2019s air ambulance, volunteered for human rights groups, lived in Asia and started an inward-investment company in Libya \u2013 primarily, she claims, to gain access to the country for human rights work.\n\nThese opaque foreign adventures appear to have caught the eye of the SCL Group, a British psy-ops company, and its ambitious chief executive, Alexander Nix. Kaiser said she first met Nix at a sushi restaurant with some Mongolian clients. He drilled her as a spy might a source, apparently telling her: \u201cLet me get you drunk and steal your secrets\u201d.\n\nThat was 2012, the year Obama was re-elected, this time on a much more sophisticated campaign whose backbone was \u201cbig data\u201d and Facebook friend networks, using techniques that foreshadowed much of what was to come.\n\nKaiser recalls Nix getting excited when she told him she\u2019d worked for Obama.\n\nKaiser worked for SCL until Cambridge Analytica was formally incorporated.\n\nNix, she says, saw the gap in the market. The Republicans were losing the data race; that was where the opportunities were.\n\nThe kind of personality questionnaires conducted by the Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan on Facebook were particularly important, she adds, as they allowed the company\u2019s data scientists to build models connecting data to behavioral traits and build \u201ca very in-depth picture on those individuals\u201d.\n\nKogan paid around 270,000 people to take his personality test. But, Kaiser says, Cambridge Analytica did many similar quizzes \u2013 not always on Facebook \u2013 and had personality data for more than 2 million Americans.\n\n\u201cThe bigger a data set that you have, the more polls, the more surveys that you have that people undertake, the more accurate your models are going to be,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s just a fact of data science.\u201d\n\nAround mid-2015, Kaiser says, the company knew Facebook was changing its API rules to restrict the data that could be harvested through questionnaires like those of Kogan.\n\nThis appears to have prompted a last-minute grab for data. In one internal email seen by the Guardian, employees are asked to identify which issues on a list of 500 Facebook \u201clike\u201d items would be most \u201cuseful for political modeling or commercial sales\u201d.\n\nIt is unclear from the email where the data was coming from, but the list is curiously revealing. Cambridge Analytica didn\u2019t want to know who \u201cliked\u201d Eminem, Family Guy, YouTube, The Walking Dead or Mountain Dew. It was, however, interested in Facebook users who \u201cliked\u201d Mitt Romney, Walt Disney World, the US Marine Corps and Coca-Cola.\n\nNigeria was one of Kaiser\u2019s first assignments. Three days ago, in one of a series of extraordinary scoops, the Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr revealed details about this project, aimed at securing the re-election of the then president, Goodluck Jonathan. He was unaware of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s involvement.\n\nCadwalladr revealed details of a murky operation by suspected Israeli hackers to discredit Johnson\u2019s rival, Muhammadu Buhari, by finding \u201ckompromat\u201d on the Nigerian politician. Asked about this, Kaiser confirms she knew the Israeli contractors.\n\n\u201cThey were working for the same client that we were working for.\u201d Who was that? \u201cOil billionaires,\u201d she replies.\n\nKaiser\u2019s story of how the Israelis got their information, however, was worse than computer hacking.\n\n\u201cThey went to Nigeria, became friends with the people in Buhari\u2019s campaign, and started sitting in meetings in the campaign headquarters,\u201d she says. \u201cThey got information by being in there, however you do that. Making friends with people, sitting in high-level meetings, working on their computers.\u201d\n\nThis, she claims, was being done independently of Cambridge Analytica.\n\nEarlier this week there was another scoop, based on undercover footage from C4 News which captured Nix boasting about using \u201choney traps\u201d, fake news campaigns and operations with ex-spies to swing election campaigns around the world. \n\n\n\nKaiser claims she had never heard him make such claims before. \u201cAlexander is known to oversell everything to close the deal.\u201d\n\nBy 2015, Nix and Kaiser were pitching to increase their market share in the most lucrative market of all: the US presidential campaign.\n\nCambridge Analytica had already worked for several 2014 mid-term candidates, Super Pacs and foundations. Consultants usually limit themselves to one presidential campaign, but Cambridge Analytica ended up working for two Republican primary candidates: Ted Cruz and Ben Carson.\n\nPrior to that, Kaiser says, the company also made unsuccessful bids for business with Carly Fiorina, Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and Chris Christie.\n\nThat same year, a former Florida governor with a famous name who many suspected would secure the nomination also visited Cambridge Analytica\u2019s London office. Kaiser says she never met Jeb Bush, but that according to Nix, the Republican political scion wanted the firm to join his future campaign for the White House.\n\nShe claims Nix always saw political campaigning as a springboard to a bigger mission.\n\n\u201cTo become a famous advertising company in the US market; that\u2019s what he planned from the beginning,\u201d she says. \u201cAlexander Nix has no interest in the Republicans or Democrats winning or losing.\u201d\n\nThat does not seem to tally with the ideological zeal driving Cambridge Analytica\u2019s patrons, the Republican billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, who later bankrolled Trump\u2019s campaign. They worked closely with Steve Bannon, whose town house on Capitol Hill \u2013 an office for Breitbart, and a nerve-centre for his political operations \u2013 has become something of a legend in Washington.\n\n\u201cYes, \u2018The Embassy\u2019,\u201d Kaiser recalls, adding: \u201cI used to actually share a key with Alexander to that house.\u201d\n\nIt was not until mid-2016 that Cambridge Analytica finally got the biggest ticket in Beltway politics: a contract with the presidential campaign.\n\nIt immediately sent a team of data scientists and political strategists to San Antonio, Texas, where the digital campaign was being run. Others went to the headquarters in Trump Towers, New York.\n\nQuestions have been asked about the legality of a London-based company, with a largely British staff, working on the campaign. Kaiser cannot answer them definitively.\n\nWhat she does know is where Nix was on the night Trump was elected, because she was there too: at the Republican\u2019s victory party in New York, standing next to the Mercers.\n\nIn her pocket, Kaiser says, she also had a ticket to Hillary Clinton\u2019s election night party. But when the TV screens \u201cstarted going red state, red state, red state\u201d before declaring Trump the victor, she knew she didn\u2019t need it.\n\nKaiser says she turned to the Mercers, who were not watching the screen, and relayed the news. \u201cYou could just see them looking at each other, like: \u2018Holy shit \u2026 we just became the most powerful people in politics\u2019.\u201d According to her account, Nix told her: \u201cWe did it.\u201d\n\nKaiser says she felt conflicted about Trump\u2019s victory, and still does.\n\nHer testimony, relayed to the Guardian in recent days in a variety of Silicon Valley locations, raises many questions \u2013 about what she says now, and what she did for the company.\n\nIt will not be easy for Kaiser to put her past behind her.\n\n\u201cCorporations like Google, Facebook, Amazon, all of these large companies, are making tens or hundreds of billions of dollars off of monetizing people\u2019s data,\u201d Kaiser says. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling companies and governments for years that data is probably your most valuable asset. Individuals should be able to monetize their own data \u2013 that\u2019s their own human value \u2013 not to be exploited.\u201d\n\nAsked if she has any regrets, Kaiser says she does.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I regret not spending all those years only working for causes I believed in, and instead just learning about how to achieve an end \u2013 how to get a result. I really know how to get a result now \u2013 and I can do it for anybody.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Guardian Staff", "body": "Donald Trump will announce death penalties for drug dealers on Monday.\n\nA top administration official said on Sunday the president\u2019s plan to combat opioid drug addiction nationwide, to be announced in New Hampshire on Monday, calls for the death penalty for drug traffickers where appropriate under current law.\n\nNew Hampshire has been hit hard by the opioid crisis, a fact Trump acknowledged last August when he said: \u201cWe have the drug lords in Mexico that are knocking the hell out of our country.

He argued that a person in the US can get the death penalty or life in prison for shooting one person, but that a drug dealer who potentially kills thousands can spend little or no time in jail.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe made similar comments at a White House summit on opioids: \u201cSome countries have a very, very tough penalty \u2013 the ultimate penalty. And, by the way, they have much less of a drug problem than we do. So we\u2019re going to have to be very strong on penalties.\u201d\n\nTrump also wants Congress to pass legislation reducing the amount of drugs needed to trigger mandatory minimum sentences for traffickers who knowingly distribute certain opioids, said Andrew Bremberg, Trump\u2019s domestic policy director, who briefed reporters on the plan Trump is scheduled to unveil.\n\nThe president will be joined by first lady Melania Trump, who has shown an interest in the issue, particularly as it pertains to her focus on child welfare.\n\nDeath for drug traffickers and mandatory minimum penalties for distributing certain opioids are two elements under the part of Trump\u2019s plan that deals with law enforcement and interdiction to break the international and domestic flow of drugs into and across the US. Other parts of the plan include broadening education and awareness and expanding access to proven treatment and recovery efforts.\n\nThe justice department said the federal death penalty is available for limited drug-related offenses, including violations of the \u201cdrug kingpin\u201d provisions of federal law.\n\n\n\nDoug Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University, said it was not clear death sentences for drug dealers, even for those whose product causes multiple deaths, would be constitutional. Berman said the issue would be litigated extensively and would have to be definitively decided by the US supreme court.\n\nOpioids, including prescription opioids, heroin and synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, killed more than 42,000 people in the US in 2016, more than any year on record, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In a speech last September she said the latest violence in Rakhine was sparked by attacks on military outposts.\n\n\u201cIt is not the intention of the Myanmar government to apportion blame or to abnegate responsibility.

In other words, one of Marathon\u2019s gas station workers would have to toil more than nine centuries to make as much as Heminger grabbed in just one year.\n\nEmployees of at least five other US firms would have to work even longer \u2013 more than a millennium \u2013 to catch up with their top bosses. These companies include the auto parts maker Aptiv (CEO-worker pay ratio: 2,526 to 1), the temp agency Manpower (2,483 to 1), amusement park owner Six Flags (1,920 to 1), Del Monte Produce (1,465 to 1), and apparel maker VF (1,353 to 1).\n\nThese revelations come thanks to a new federal regulation that requires publicly traded US corporations to disclose, for the first time ever, how much their chief executives are making compared to their median workers. The disclosures are just now starting to flow in.\n\nUp until this year, comparisons of CEO and worker pay have had to rely on the average take-homes of US workers overall \u2013 not the pay of workers at individual corporations. Those generalized figures helped us track the soaring trajectory of executive compensation at big US corporations, from 30 times average worker pay in the 1960s to over 300 times more recently.\n\nBut headlines around those average figures did next to nothing to slow our CEO pay-hike express. Will the release of the ratios at individual corporations make any more of a difference?\n\nCorporate America must surely think so. Ever since 2010, the year Congress plugged a ratio disclosure mandate into the Dodd-Frank financial reform act, corporate lobbyists have been scheming to delay and repeal that mandate\u2019s implementation. But responsible investors and other activists rallied and kept the mandate in place.\n\nThe new ratios offer a benchmark for corporate greed that exposes exactly which firms are sharing the wealth their employees create and which aren\u2019t, knowledge we can use to impose consequences on the corporations doing the most to make the United States more unequal.\n\nIn Oregon, the city of Portland has adopted what the economist Branko Milanovi\u0107 has labeled \u201cthe first tax that targets inequality as such\u201d. Portland\u2019s new levy imposes a 10% business tax surcharge on companies with top execs making over 100 times their median worker pay \u2014 and a 20% surcharge on firms with pay gaps that stretch past 250 times.\n\nCity officials in San Francisco are bringing a similar measure before voters this November. At the state level, lawmakers in Minnesota, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Illinois, and Massachusetts are getting into the pay-ratio tax act as well.\n\nIn California, a state Senate bill that took the same approach nearly passed. The key sponsor of that measure, Mark DeSaulnier, now sits in Congress, where he\u2019s co-sponsoring a like-minded federal bill.\n\nOther lawmakers are advancing proposals to link government procurement to pay ratios. Existing public policies deny government contracts to companies with employment practices that contribute to race and gender inequality. Why should tax dollars be subsidizing firms that increase economic inequality?\n\nIn Rhode Island, a pending Senate bill would give preferential treatment in state contracting to corporations that pay their CEOs no more than 25 times their median worker pay. Several congressional offices are now preparing legislation that aims in the same direction.\n\nEven some Republicans have shown interest in leveraging the power of the public purse against firms that pay top execs astronomically more than workers. In 2015, then Republican congressman (now the White House budget director) Mick Mulvaney tried to prevent the US Export-Import Bank from subsidizing any company with CEO pay over 100 times median worker pay. Lawmakers could easily apply the same standard to other forms of corporate welfare.\n\nRatio disclosure also opens doors for trade unions to bring demands tied to pay gaps into collective bargaining. Consumers can shun corporations that lavish pay on their top execs at the expense of their employees.

Later he told Fox Putin looked \u201clike a great leader\u201d. Putin\u2019s constant goals have been to destroy Nato and the EU. Trump was a big advocate of Brexit, which was a body blow to the EU, and in the 2016 campaign he called Nato \u201cobsolete\u201d. Trump began visiting Moscow in 1987 and his on again, off again effort to build a Trump Tower there continued for three decades \u2013 right through the presidential election.\n\nIn 2006, Trump became executive producer of a Russian version of The Apprentice. Years later he dismissed the massive evidence that Putin routinely orders the murder of journalists and other dissidents, telling MSNBC: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen that. I don\u2019t know that he has. Have you been able to prove that?\u201d\n\nThen of course there\u2019s the Palm Beach estate he bought for $45m in 2004. After the housing bubble burst, he sold that house for $95m \u2013 to a Russian oligarch, Dmitry Rybolovlev.\n\nNearly all the other stations of the twisted Trump-Russian cross are covered here, including the famous Trump Tower meeting between Russian emissaries and Donald Trump Jr, Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner. Although the Russians failed at that moment to produce promised dirt on Hillary Clinton, the authors point out that \u201cTrump\u2019s senior advisers now had new reason to believe that Putin\u2019s regime wanted Trump to win and was willing to act clandestinely to boost his chances. The campaign did not report this private Russian outreach to the FBI.\u201d\n\nRussian government officials, Corn and Isikoff write, could well have \u201cinterpreted that as a signal that Trump would not mind or protest if Moscow took other actions to benefit the Republican candidate. The Russians had offered to help, and Trump\u2019s campaign had demonstrated a willingness to take what Moscow had to offer.\u201d\n\nAlmost any of these details would have been enough to torpedo any other presidential campaign, but Trump somehow managed to weather every single crisis. A big reason for that was the astonishingly poor news judgment of the mainstream media, including, in particular, the New York Times.\n\nA Harvard study of mainstream election coverage revealed that there were \u201croughly four times as many Clinton-related sentences that described scandals as opposed to policies \u2013 whereas Trump-related sentences were one-and-a-half times as likely to be about policy as scandal\u201d. There were also more than 60,000 sentences published about Clinton and her emails \u2013 and less than 10,000 about Trump\u2019s connections to Russia.\n\nBarack Obama\u2019s dithering in the face of Russian intrusions also contributed to the disastrous outcome. An Obama official told Corn and Isikoff it wasn\u2019t until two months after the election that \u201call the pieces came together for us\u201d. When they did, Vice-President Joe Biden had a \u201cvisceral reaction: \u2018If this is true, it\u2019s treason.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe only Democrat who acted appropriately during the campaign was the Senate minority leader, Harry Reid, who directly attacked the FBI director, James Comey, for his double standard.\n\n\u201cAs soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to Secretary Clinton, you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible,\u201d he wrote, adding that \u201cit has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisers, and the Russian government. The public has a right to know this information.\u201d\n\nMuch has been written elsewhere about what may well have been the single worst story published in the final days before the election. Immediately after Slate had published a brilliant and nuanced piece by Franklin Foer about unexplained communications between a Trump business server and Alfa Bank in Moscow, the Times\u2019s executive editor, Dean Baquet, approved an article with this headline: \u201cInvestigating Donald Trump, FBI Sees No Clear Link to Russia.\u201d\n\nAmong its many other failings, that headline contradicted the story\u2019s most important finding: US intelligence agencies \u201chad been compelled by \u2018apparent connections between some of Mr Trump\u2019s aides and Moscow\u2019 to \u2018open a broad investigation into possible links between the Russian government and Republican presidential candidate\u2019\u201d.\n\nAs Corn and Isikoff explain, the editors decided to make the FBI\u2019s failure to prove a connection the article\u2019s theme, instead of the much more important fact of the investigation itself.\n\nWhat is new in Russian Roulette about the Times piece is how the ex-British spy Christopher Steele reacted to it. Steele was the author of the dossier which contained details of extensive contacts between Trump aides and the Russians in 2016, as well as the notorious story about Trump\u2019s alleged activities at Moscow\u2019s Ritz-Carlton hotel.\n\nBefore the Times piece appeared, Steele had been considering a trip to Washington to discuss his findings with members of Congress \u2013 and perhaps hold a press conference on the steps of the Capitol. Once he saw that the Times was pooh-poohing the whole subject, Steele cancelled his trip.\n\nIf Steele had gone public, could that have been enough to change the election? That is one of the many tantalizing what-ifs in this compelling account.\n\nHarding\u2019s book is more thorough about several important aspects of this history, including the extremely strange role of Deutsche Bank, which extended hundreds of millions of dollars of loans to Trump at the same time its Moscow branch was laundering millions of dollars for Russian oligarchs.\n\nBut Russian Roulette still makes many important contributions to this extraordinary story \u2013 a saga which I believe is destined to bring an abrupt end to the Trump presidency.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Emma Graham-harrison", "body": "Senior executives from the firm at the heart of Facebook\u2019s data breach boasted of playing a key role in bringing Donald Trump to power and said they used \u201cunattributable and untrackable\u201d advertising to support their clients in elections, according to an undercover expose.\n\nIn secretly recorded conversations, Cambridge Analytica\u2019s CEO, Alexander Nix, claimed he had met Trump \u201cmany times\u201d, while another senior member of staff said the firm was behind the \u201cdefeat crooked Hillary\u201d advertising campaign.\n\n\u201cWe just put information into the bloodstream of the internet and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again over time to watch it take shape,\u201d said the executive. \u201cAnd so this stuff infiltrates the online community, but with no branding, so it\u2019s unattributable, untrackable.\u201d\n\nCaught on camera by an undercover team from Channel 4 News, Nix was also dismissive of Democrats on the House intelligence committee, who had questioned him over Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign.\n\nSenior managers then appeared to suggest that in their work for US clients, there was planned division of work between official campaigns and unaffiliated \u201cpolitical action groups\u201d.\n\nThat could be considered coordination \u2013 which is not allowed under US election law. The firm has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nCambridge Analytica said it had a firewall policy in place, signed by all staff and strictly enforced.\n\nThe disclosures are the latest to hit Cambridge Analytica, which has been under mounting pressure since Sunday, when the Observer reported the company had unauthorised access to tens of millions of Facebook profiles \u2013 and used them to build a political targeting system.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s second instalment of an undercover investigation by Channel 4 News in association with the Observer, Nix said he had a close working relationship with Trump and claimed Cambridge Analytica was pivotal to his successful campaign.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting. We ran all the digital campaign, the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy,\u201d he told reporters who were posing as potential clients from Sri Lanka.\n\nThe company\u2019s head of data, Alex Tayler, added: \u201cWhen you think about the fact that Donald Trump lost the popular vote by 3m votes but won the electoral college vote that\u2019s down to the data and the research.\n\n\u201cYou did your rallies in the right locations, you moved more people out in those key swing states on election day. That\u2019s how he won the election.\u201d\n\nAnother executive, Mark Turnbull, managing director of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s political division, was recorded saying: \u201cHe won by 40,000 votes in three states. The margins were tiny.\u201d\n\nTurnbull took credit for one of the most well known and controversial campaigns of the last presidential campaign, organised by the political action group Make America Number 1.\n\n\u201cThe brand was \u2018Defeat Crooked Hillary\u2019. You\u2019ll remember this of course?\u201d he told the undercover reporter. \u201cThe zeros, the OO of crooked were a pair of handcuffs ... We made hundreds of different kinds of creative, and we put it online.\u201d\n\nTurnbull said the company sometimes used \u201cproxy organisations\u201d, including charities and activist groups, to help disseminate the messages \u2013 and keep the company\u2019s involvement in the background.\n\nWhen the undercover reporter expressed worries that American authorities might seize on details of a dirty campaign, Nix said the US had no jurisdiction over Cambridge Analytica, even though the company is American and is registered in Delaware.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely convinced that they have no jurisdiction,\u201d he told the purported client. \u201cSo if US authorities came asking for information, they would simply refuse to collaborate. \u201cWe\u2019ll say: none of your business.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Channel 4 News before seeing the undercover film, Hillary Clinton said: \u201cThere was a new kind of campaign that was being run on the other side, that nobody had ever faced before. Because it wasn\u2019t just all about me. It was about how to suppress voters who were inclined to vote for me \u2026 when you have a massive propaganda effort to prevent people from thinking straight, because they\u2019re being flooded with false information.\u201d\n\nIn the report, Nix also implied that it was possible to mislead authorities by omission, discussing his appearance in front of the House intelligence committee, for its inquiry into possible Russian election meddling.\n\n\n\nThe Republicans only asked three questions, which took five minutes, he told the reporter. And while the Democrats spent two hours questioning him, he claimed they were so far out of their depths that he didn\u2019t mind responding.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have no secrets. They\u2019re politicians, they\u2019re not technical. They don\u2019t understand how it works,\u201d he said, when asked about whether he was forced to testify.\n\n\n\nHe went on to describe how political candidates are manipulated.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t understand because the candidate never, is never involved. He\u2019s told what to do by the campaign team.\u201d The reporter asks if that means the candidate is just a puppet, and Nix replies simply: \u201cAlways.\u201d\n\nIn another exchange, Tayler describes an apparently planned division of spending on the campaign trail, with the candidate organising \u201cpositive\u201d messages, with negative attack ads left to the super Pacs, which may engage in unlimited political spending independently of the campaigns.\n\n\u201cAs part of it, sometimes you have to separate it from the political campaign itself ... campaigns are normally subject to limits about how much money they can raise. Whereas outside groups can raise an unlimited amount.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the campaign will use their finite resources for things like persuasion and mobilisation and then they leave the \u2018air war\u2019 they call it, like the negative attack ads to other affiliated groups.\u201d\n\nThis raises questions over whether Cambridge Analytica blurred the boundaries between official campaign groups, which have spending limits, and unaffiliated political action groups or super Pacs. \n\n\n\nThe latter can spend as much as they want but must not coordinate with the candidate they support.\n\nThe Campaign Legal Center has accused Cambridge Analytica over allegations of illegal coordination of this nature.\n\nIt has filed evidence with the FEC alleging that the super Pac Make America Number 1 made illegal contributions to Trump\u2019s campaign, \u201cengaging in unlawful coordinated spending by using the common vendor Cambridge Analytica\u201d.\n\nCambridge Analytica said it had never claimed to have won the election for Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThis is patently absurd. We are proud of the work we did on that campaign, and have spoken in many public forums about what we consider to be our contribution to the campaign.\u201d\n\nIt said there was no evidence of coordination between the Make America Number 1 super Pac and the Trump campaign. The company said it was not under investigation.\n\nIt has accused the Channel 4 News undercover investigation of grossly misrepresenting how the company conducts its business.\n\n\n\nHowever, speaking to the BBC on Monday, Nix said he had \u201chuge amounts of regret that we undertook this meeting and spoke with a certain amount of hyperbole\u201d.\n\nOn Tuesday the website Politico reported that Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign was moving to distance itself from Cambridge Analytica.

They aren\u2019t out there saying, \u2018Don\u2019t vote for anything unless we have everything\u2019.\u201d\n\nBut Rubio also warned against the increasingly partisan nature of the guns debate, which he said could halt the momentum behind a new spirit of bipartisan compromise on issues that include gun violence restraining orders and raising the minimum age restrictions for purchasing firearms.\n\n\u201cThe attitude of total victory -- the idea that somehow some of us are going to come up here and get everything we want and just run over the other side -- our system is just not set up for that,\u201d Rubio said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re creating unrealistic expectations and, in the process, nothing happens.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Republican senator rejected in particular the notion that an assault weapons ban should serve as a litmus test, suggesting such an approach was neither pragmatic nor productive.\n\nRubio was interviewed as part of the guest-editing of the Guardian US site by student journalists from the Eagle Eye, the newspaper of Stoneman Douglas. The students requested the interview with the Florida senator because they particularly wanted to put questions directly to lawmakers from both parties as part of the collaboration.\n\nRubio sat down with the Guardian on Capitol Hill on Thursday, shortly after unveiling a so-called \u201cred flag\u201d bill, which would encourage states to adopt policies allowing law enforcement officials or family members to file gun restraining orders to remove firearms from potentially violent individuals. \n\n\n\nRubio\u2019s home state of Florida, as well as a handful of others, have enacted such laws. Orlando police have already credited the law with preventing a potential mass shooting.\n\n\n\nCongress also appeared close to sending a spending bill to Donald Trump\u2019s desk, which included measures that would: reverse a ban on gun violence research; and amend the existing background checks system. Rubio is a co-sponsor of the latter proposalwhich does not close loopholes for private sales or purchases at gun shows but tightens measures to ensure that states and federal agencies are actually entering the proper records into the federal background check system.\n\nRubio said he remains supportive of further gun controls, such as raising the age restriction for purchasing some firearms from 18 to 21, but he predicted it would take longer to corral enough votes. The senator also suggested he was open to new limits on high capacity magazines but had yet to coalesce around a specific proposal.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried to rank these things, not just in order of how quickly we can pass them, but how effective they would be,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI believe the most effective thing we can do to prevent gun violence is to identify potential attackers and stop them before they act.\u201d\n\nRubio had a meteoric rise as a young senator, but his bid for the Republican presidential nomination last year came to a halt when Donald Trump beat him in his home state primary.\n\nRubio subsequently chose to seek re-election to the Senate, reversing an earlier pledge to leave Congress. In doing so, he cited in part another mass shooting in Florida \u2013 the June 2016 attack at the LGBT Orlando nightclub Pulse.\n\nThat shooting, as with the spate of others since the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school massacre, failed to produce any new laws in Washington. \n\n\n\nAfter Pulse, in which an alleged Islamic State sympathizer gunned down 49 people and wounded 58 others, Rubio proposed legislation that would make it more difficult for suspected terrorists to purchase firearms. The proposal went nowhere in the Senate.\n\n\n\nAs a 2016 presidential candidate, Rubio positioned himself as a staunch proponent of the second amendment right to bear arms. Critics have been quick to point to the roughly $3.3m Rubio has received from the National Rifle Association\u2019s political arm as evidence of the gun lobby\u2019s influence over his posture toward gun control.\n\nRubio has insisted his donors do not dictate his agenda, but rather buy into it, and refused to commit to no longer taking money from the NRA when he was put on the spot on live television by a Parkland student during last month\u2019s CNN town hall.\n\nHe chafed at the notion that his approach to the gun debate was shaped by the NRA line, telling the Guardian he found the relentless focus on one group counterproductive to bipartisan talks.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a terrible way to judge public policy \u2013 an idea is either a good idea or a bad idea,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThis fixation on one group versus another group in our debate \u2026 I get why people are out there doing it for political purposes, but in my view we should judge ideas by whether they work or don\u2019t work \u2013 not by who supports them or who opposes them.\u201d\n\nSome of the Parkland students disagree with Rubio\u2019s line of defense. David Hogg, one of the more high-profile activists in the aftermath of the shooting, called out Rubio by name during a Thursday press conference on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u2018If you want to continue to be supported by the NRA, like Marco Rubio, that\u2019s OK,\u201d Hogg said, \u201cBecause we\u2019ll vote you out. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\n\nRubio, who has met with several of the Parkland families, said it was the right of the voters to force out lawmakers whose record they found to be lacking. But he disputed the notion that his ideas were workshopped through the NRA.\n\nRubio pointed to a proposal he is pushing that was advocated by Sandy Hook Promise, a group formed after the tragedy in Newtown. A version of the legislation, known as the STOP School Violence Act, was passed by the House of Representatives last week and would offer federal grants to states to strengthen school security and bolster school training to identify potential threats.\n\n\n\nRyan Petty, whose 14-year-old daughter Alaina JoAnn Petty died in the Parkland shooting, said Rubio had personally engaged with several families of the Parkland victims and visited their home while developing his response.\n\n\u201cWe are aligned on the idea that we need to focus on common values and ideas and craft legislation that addresses those commonalities first,\u201d Petty told the Guardian. \n\n\n\n\u201cAfter every mass shooting, we inevitably devolve in to a debate over the meaning of the second amendment, its meaning and applicability to modern America,\u201d he added. \u201cLegislatively, it\u2019s a road to nowhere.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Sam Jones In Madrid", "body": "Catalonia\u2019s latest presidential candidate is to appear in court hours after the region\u2019s most hardline pro-independence party scuppered his first attempt to be elected by abstaining from an investiture debate.\n\n\n\nJordi Turull and five other separatist leaders have been summoned to the supreme court in Madrid on Friday to learn what action they will face over their roles in last year\u2019s unilateral referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.\n\nOne of the six, Marta Rovira, general secretary of the Catalan Republican Left party, failed to attend court and sent a letter to colleagues explaining that she had fled Spain and gone into exile.\n\nFacing rebellion charges that carry maximum 30-year sentences, they could be remanded in custody when they appear on Friday.

We are looking for a candidate with a history in some aspect of the adult entertainment industry,\u201d read the ad placed in 2008.\n\nVitter, the Republican senator from Louisiana who championed family values, had been ensnared in a prostitution scandal and some cheeky pranksters wanted to troll him on it.\n\nBut soon, what started as a gonzo prank idea was turning into something if not serious then at least real. \u201cWE HAVE FOUND OUR PORN STAR,\u201d read a follow-up post.\n\nThe porn star in question was Daniels, and in no time she was grabbing national headlines with her slogan that promised \u201cScrewing People Honestly\u201d \u2013 unlike her male opponent.\n\nAs wild as that was, that turned out to only be the prelude to Stormy Daniels\u2019 main event. She currently faces a much more powerful male adversary, the president of the United States, as she prepares to go public on Sunday in a TV interview to give details about her alleged 2006 affair with Donald Trump.\n\nThe interview with Anderson Cooper, which is expected to break viewership records for CBS\u2019s venerable 60 Minutes news magazine show, is easy to dismiss as frivolity. But her allegations, and the legal maneuvers Trump\u2019s allies have employed to try to keep them quiet, could have implications spanning not just sex and sexual politics \u2013 but campaign finance laws and violence against women.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know who become the pivotal players in history,\u201d said Jonathan Tilove, who chronicled Daniels\u2019 first steps in politics as a correspondent for the New Orleans Times-Picayune.\n\nBorn Stephanie Gregory Clifford in Baton Rouge in 1979, Daniels grew up with her mother, who worked as a trucking company manager. Her dad was seldom around. As a girl she loved dancing and horses, but if her parents hoped she might pursue a childhood dream of becoming a vet, it was not to be. She left home and began stripping at 17; by 21 she was performing in adult films under the stage name Stormy Daniels.\n\nShe considers it her real name, but her mother, Sheila Gregory, can\u2019t abide it.\n\n\u201cMy daughter\u2019s name is Stephanie, not Stormy,\u201d she said when the Guardian reached her at home Tuesday. \u201cPlease forgive me if you think I\u2019m being rude,\u201d she added, before hanging up.\n\nGregory may not have made peace with her daughter\u2019s career, but by any measure, Daniels is extremely successful at what she does, both in front of the camera and behind it. She started directing in her mid-20s, and won best new starlet at the 2004 AVN awards, referred to as the \u201cthe Oscars of porn\u201d. The following year, she made a number of cameos in mainstream film, including Judd Apatow\u2019s blockbuster hit The 40-Year-Old Virgin. (On social media, Apatow has said he admires her work.)\n\nIn 2009, when her Louisiana campaign began, Daniels was living in Florida and not registered with either party. And as those who worked with her, most of whom did not want to speak on the record, quickly realized, she was not going to be a prop, but sensed opportunity. \u201cShe was smart enough to know that we weren\u2019t trying to drag her through some college prank, that maybe this was an avenue to explore,\u201d said a person with knowledge of the campaign.\n\nHer platform, thin though it was, was socially liberal and fiscally conservative. But mainly it was about trolling Vitter, and she was a master provocateur. Asked if she was pro-life, for instance, she said she was \u201cpro-condom\u201d. Asked if she really just wanted to embarrass Vitter, she replied flatly: \u201cI don\u2019t see how I could possibly embarrass him more than he\u2019s already embarrassed himself.\u201d\n\nMost notable though, was her ability to stay in the public eye, despite her never formally entering the race. \u201cIt was clear she was smart, prepared and comfortable with the media frenzy,\u201d said Democratic operative Bradley Beychok, who met with Daniels during a \u201clistening tour\u201d in Baton Rouge.\n\nThe Craigslist post turned what should have been a low-key election into a national spectacle, and Louisiana is just quirky enough of a place that national election forecaster Nate Silver didn\u2019t rule her out. \u201cShe\u2019s certainly not without her, um, charms,\u201d Silver wrote at the time.\n\nDaniels\u2019 campaign would prove quite literally explosive. At the height of her political momentum, the Audi belonging to her political manager burst into flames, and though no one was ever apprehended, blurry surveillance footage showed someone loitering around the car and getting into it shortly before it detonated.\n\nSoon after that, and amid a domestic violence arrest, Daniels opted out of the race. Vitter would go on to win, riding the wave of anti-Obama backlash in 2010. But when he ran for governor a few years later, his Democratic opponent won in an upset by reviving the prostitution scandal that Daniels had worked to highlight.\n\nToday, as she prepares to take on the president, Daniels is \u2013 improbably, perhaps, at 39 \u2013 on top of her industry, with a confidence and acerbic Twitter profile to match.\n\nHer second foray into politics began in February, when the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, had paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about her story just before the 2016 election.\n\nIn response to the bombshell, the tabloid In Touch Weekly published an interview with Daniels it had been sitting on since 2011, kept under wraps due to legal threats from Trump\u2019s circle. In the interview, Daniels describes in explicit detail a consensual, nearly year-long sexual dalliance with Trump, allegedly begun weeks after his wife Melania gave birth to their son, Barron.\n\nSunday\u2019s interview, however, will be the first time Daniels has spoken about the matter since Trump forged his own political career, and the first time she will address the efforts to muzzle her, which she has been fighting in court.\n\nDetails from Daniels\u2019 account further shape the narratives that first emerged about Trump and his relationship with women during the 2016 election. More than a dozen women came forward to accuse Trump of sexual harassment and assault in the lead-up to the election. And while Daniels\u2019 alleged affair with Trump was consensual, the context is nonetheless informative about how he views women.\n\nAnd Daniels is not alone. Another adult film star, Jessica Drake, who accused Trump of trying to buy sex from her, claims she also has \u201cconfidential information\u201d about Trump\u2019s relationship with Daniels, according to a 2016 non-disclosure agreement or NDA.\n\nOn Tuesday, the former Playboy model Karen McDougal became the second woman this month to challenge Trump\u2019s efforts to silence her, announcing she was suing the president to be released from a 2016 legal agreement that restricted her ability to speak about her alleged affair with the future president.\n\nSeparately, a judge this month ruled that a defamation suit brought by former Apprentice star Summer Zervos, who accused Trump of harassing her, may go forward, clearing the path for other sexual misconduct allegations against the president to be aired.\n\n\u201cIt is settled that the president of the United States has no immunity and is \u2018subject to the laws\u2019 for purely private acts,\u201d the judge declared, citing the precedent set by a lawsuit brought against Bill Clinton by his alleged mistress Paula Jones two decades ago.\n\nMeanwhile, the president, who has denied all the claims brought against him, remains committed to keeping Daniels quiet.\n\nDaniels\u2019 legal team, in a clever bit of maneuvering, has offered to pay back every dollar she was paid in the NDA for the chance to speak freely. Her team claims the agreement is null and void because Trump never signed it, and they are moving ahead with the CBS interview despite a threat from Trump\u2019s camp of up to $20m in damages.\n\nDaniels now has a target on her back, and her lawyer has said she\u2019s been physically threatened and is under 24-hour security. But her background in adult entertainment may give her a rare liberty other women Trump has tried to shame into silence do not possess. Namely, she is not easily embarrassed and she doesn\u2019t care if people don\u2019t like her.\n\n\u201cSlut and whore are words used by people who feel threatened,\u201d she responded to a troll on Twitter who accused her of promiscuity. \u201cI find power in them.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "David Smith In Washington", "body": "Donald Trump bragged that he made up facts in a meeting with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, according to an audio recording obtained by the Washington Post.\n\nThe US president \u2013 notorious for making false claims on countless issues \u2013 admitted he told Trudeau that America has a trade deficit with its neighbour when he \u201chad no idea\u201d if that was true.\n\nThe office of the US trade representative states that the American goods and services trade surplus with Canada was $12.5bn in 2016.\n\nAccording to the recording, Trump told guests at a fundraising dinner in Missouri: \u201cTrudeau came to see me. He\u2019s a good guy, Justin. He said, \u2018No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none.

Last year, in honour of Canada Day, the president used Twitter to praise his \u201cnew found friend\u201d north of the border.\n\nTrump defied critics in his own Republican party last week to announce stiff import taxes on steel and aluminium, risking a trade war with China and the European Union (EU). His top economic adviser Gary Cohn quit over the tariffs, while secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who also disagreed with them, was fired earlier this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Post report says, the president again lambasted the EU, China, Japan and South Korea, which he claimed were taking advantage of America. He also described the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) as a disaster and appeared to threaten to pull US troops out of South Korea if the country does not come up with a satisfactory trade deal.\n\n\u201cWe have a very big trade deficit with them, and we protect them,\u201d Trump was quoted as telling donors. \u201cWe lose money on trade, and we lose money on the military. We have right now 32,000 soldiers between North and South Korea. Let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOur allies care about themselves. They don\u2019t care about us.\u201d\n\nAfter visiting a Boeing factory in St Louis earlier in the day, Trump was headlining a fundraiser for Republican US Senate candidate Josh Hawley, who is running for the seat held by Democrat Claire McCaskill.\n\nBut as is his wont, the president boasted about his 2016 presidential election victory, derided cable news anchors and mocked his predecessors, George W Bush and Barack Obama, for failing to achieve what he has done by setting up a meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. \u201cIt\u2019s called appeasement: please don\u2019t do anything,\u201d he reportedly said.\n\nTrump made 2,140 false or misleading claims in his first year as president, according to a Washington Post count.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Jon Swaine In New York", "body": "He said he was a multimillionaire \u2013 an international property developer with a plan to fix America\u2019s cities through radical privatization.

Citing connections across the military, business and academia, he said: \u201cI bring, and draw on, experiences from different areas of knowledge, like a polymath.\u201d\n\nJafry was contracted to work for Trump\u2019s housing and urban development department (Hud). His government email signature said his title was senior adviser. Jafry said he used his role to advocate for \u201cmicrocities\u201d, where managers privately set their own laws and taxes away from central government control.\n\nBut those plans are now stalled. Jafry, 38, said he had resigned from his position with Hud after the Guardian asked him to explain multiple allegations of fraud as well as exaggerations in his biography.\n\nJafry, who has also been known by Jafari and Jafri, apologised for inflating his military record but denied making other false claims. He said he resigned because the Guardian\u2019s questions tarnished his reputation inside Hud.\n\n\u201cYou and I both know we live in the world of opinion and facts merging together,\u201d he said.\n\nHud declined to discuss Jafry. The finding may present new problems for Ben Carson, Trump\u2019s Hud secretary. Internal emails on Wednesday indicated Carson and his wife \u201cpicked out\u201d a controversial $31,000 furniture set for his office, after Carson said he had had no involvement.\n\nStyling himself as an \u201centrepreneur and philanthropist\u201d, Jafry said he controlled a multimillion-dollar trust fund built since 1885 by relatives in India. According to court records, however, he struggled to pay rent and bills while engaging in a series of failed takeovers of gas stations and other ventures in Texas over the past decade.\n\nIn November 2013, a judge ordered Jafry and a fuel company he chaired to repay more than $800,000 to the family of Alfred Oglesby, a former NFL player and investor in the fuel firm, who died in 2009. Oglesby\u2019s widow accused Jafry of fraud. Jafry has not paid the money. Debt collectors said they had been trying to locate him for years.\n\nDavid Freedman, an attorney for Oglesby\u2019s family, said he was surprised Jafry had resurfaced in an influential role in the government. \u201cIf he is advising Donald Trump we\u2019re screwed \u2013 we should just surrender to North Korea right now,\u201d said Freedman.\n\nJafry denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations. He said he never received Oglesby\u2019s investment, so he didn\u2019t owe Oglesby\u2019s family money.\n\nHaving arrived in the US in about 2005, Jafry was the subject of several other legal actions in Texas. Owners of gas stations that Jafry tried to buy sued him and his business associates, repeatedly accusing Jafry of fraud and breaching contracts.\n\nJafry denied wrongdoing. Two lawsuits were settled; a third was dismissed after Jafry did not respond and the plaintiffs failed to locate him. He said the deals collapsed because one owner made false claims about his property, while another failed to disclose that nearby construction work would harm trade.\n\nIn February 2008, Jafry drew up a list of his holdings that said his personal wealth totalled $18.3m. The document, which was later filed to court, attributed most of his wealth to 164 acres of residential land in Mumbai, where he was raised.\n\nYet after the filing of an eviction lawsuit in September 2010, Jafry was ordered by a Texas court to leave his four-bedroom home in Richmond and give the landlord $10,000, after failing to pay rent for seven months. He was also sued by the local power company after failing to pay his $4,300 bill.\n\nJafry said the 2008 document was accurate at the time, but that his wealth had since evaporated because his claim to the Mumbai land was revoked by relatives unhappy with his troubled US ventures. He said he had already left the rented house when the eviction lawsuit was filed after being unsatisfied with the property.\n\nInitially, Jafry told the Guardian he had been hired to work on Hud\u2019s envision centers, which work to reduce the number of people dependent on public housing. He later said he had not worked there after all, but declined to explain. Hud declined repeated requests to clarify what Jafry worked on.\n\nAsked in the earlier interview whether he had discussed microcities with Carson, Jafry said: \u201cWe are working on a political solution on this.\u201d Jafry said he had met Donald Trump before the 2016 election in \u201ca general setting\u201d, but declined to elaborate.\n\nIn addition to Jafry\u2019s financial issues, a series of misrepresentations or exaggerations were found in a review of his personal website, other online sources and biographical information he provided.\n\nDuring an interview, Jafry described himself as a veteran of the US army and said he was deployed to Kosovo. When confronted with his service record, though, he said he in fact served as a reservist in the army national guard, and remained in California while giving logistics support to colleagues in Kosovo.\n\nA version of Jafry\u2019s biography on his website said he held a degree in law and alternative dispute resolution from National University in La Jolla, California. Prof Jack Hamlin, chairman of National\u2019s department of professional studies, said: \u201cWe do not offer a \u2018law degree\u2019.\u201d He declined to discuss Jafry\u2019s case. Jafry later said he received a BA in pre-law studies.\n\nJafry has said that before arriving in the US, he made millions in the hospitality industry in Africa. An SEC filing from October 2007 said Jafry was a \u201cfounding partner\u201d of the Marakanelo Hotel Group in Botswana. His former website biography said he had owned a group of safari resorts and hotels in Africa which had \u201cmerged with Marakanelo Hotels\u201d, securing him a $7.5m windfall.\n\nBut Sibo Gumpo, the group commercial manager of Crest Hotels, which operates the Marakanelo sites, said in a series of emails that this was not the case. \u201cWe do not have a record of the transaction,\u201d said Gumpo.\n\nJafry has over recent years led a series of small energy-related companies operating under variants of the name Zeons.\n\nAmong the projects listed on the Zeons website under Jafry\u2019s \u201cmicrocities\u201d branding is a residential property development in Chester county, Pennsylvania, named the Sussex Estates. But this is not a microcity. According to public records, it is owned by Ram Naidu, a retired doctor.\n\n\u201cNaved does not have any financial interest in the Sussex development,\u201d Sukhi Singh, who assisted Naidu, said in an email. Singh said Naidu was a friend of Jafry\u2019s mother. Jafry said he had a verbal agreement to promote the development.\n\nRaffi Williams, a Hud spokesman, said in an email that Jafry was hired through Accel Corporation, a contractor. When this was put to Stacye Loman, the owner of Accel Corporation, she said in an email: \u201cThat is an incorrect statement.\u201d Loman then gave the names of two different companies that she said had hired Jafry. She did not answer when asked if these had been subcontracted by her company.\n\nWilliams stressed that Hud\u2019s contract with Accel \u201cwas procured in 2015\u201d. While Accel did begin providing services to Hud under the Obama administration in 2015, public records said Hud signed contracts for $2.1m worth of services from Accel in 2017 under Trump and Carson.\n\nOne record said Accel signed an $800,000 deal with Hud on 26 September 2017 to \u201cprovide expert guidance\u201d in helping senior Hud officials \u201cto embrace change and provide dynamic leadership\u201d.

One senior MP in an influential position said she expected an ugly atmosphere: \u201cHe has managed to combine antisemitism with an attack on Remainers in one weekend. This is about our identity as a progressive, tolerant, pro-European party.

It is simply not credible to suggest that a man with his knowledge of foreign affairs did not recognise those images for what they were.\n\n\u201cMany of us would call for a formal disciplinary process, but the sad truth is that our party has been so badly undermined that no one would believe it would be meaningful. Jeremy Corbyn needs to appear before MPs on Monday to address this crisis.\u201d\n\nLabour sources said that Corbyn was not due to appear on Monday and would not do so. The initial anger came on Friday when Corbyn was asked by the Labour MP Luciana Berger, who is Jewish, to account for his apparent support for an obviously antisemitic mural in 2012.\n\nPainted by street artist Mear One, it depicted a caricatured group of Jewish financiers and capitalists playing a Monopoly-style game on a board balanced on the backs of unclothed, emaciated people. Corbyn left a supportive comment on a Facebook post by Mear One, whose real name is Kalen Ockerman, after the artist revealed his work was to be whitewashed.\n\nCorbyn\u2019s explanations on Friday, and eventual expression of \u201csincere regret\u201d that he had not looked more closely at what he now accepts is clearly an antisemitic image before questioning why it had to be removed, failed to reassure MPs or Jewish organisations. The row has blown up after a prolonged period of bitter arguments in Labour of cases of alleged antisemitism.\n\nBerger said: \u201cI want to hear from the leader on Monday, because his two responses so far have been wholly inadequate.\u201d\n\nSome MPs in the centre and on the right of the party were also concerned recently at Corbyn\u2019s qualified criticism of Moscow over the Salisbury nerve gas attacks, while there is mounting worry about the way the left is tightening its grip week by week on the machinery that runs the party.\n\nOn Friday evening, Corbyn\u2019s decision to sack shadow Northern Ireland secretary Owen Smith for his support for a second EU referendum and membership of the single market prompted more outrage in the large pro-EU wing of the party. Smith said yesterday that leaving the EU was \u201cthe biggest economic crisis that our country will have faced for many, many generations\u201d and that he believed Labour should stand against leaving the EU.\n\nLord Hain, a former Labour cabinet minister, said that Smith\u2019s sacking was reminiscent of a \u201cStalinist purge\u201d. hat made a nonsense of the leader\u2019s claims to be tolerant of a wide range of views. The shadow home secretary Diane Abbott insisted that Smith could not expect to stay in the shadow cabinet while advocating an approach to Brexit that was completely out of line with official party policy.\n\nAs the anti-semistism row raged on last night the editor of the Jewish Chronicle Stephen Pollard labelled Corbyn \u201ca liar\u201d for claiming he did not realise the 2012 mural was antisemitic, while Karen Pollock, the chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said: \u201cThe mural was blatantly antisemitic using images commonly found in antisemitic propaganda \u2013 it is impossible not to notice.

It\u2019s exciting and in terms of the themes of this particular conference, it is very appropriate.\n\nAgriculture is still the mainstay of the state and there are huge opportunities there. Industry and of course technology which is really a game changer, that\u2019s where there\u2019s considerable latent opportunity.\n\nWhen you look into other states, because I\u2019ve spoken to many and they talk about how some other states can take a leaf out of Ogun State\u2019s book. I mean, when you look at the IGR alone, it\u2019s gone from about N730million to over N7 billion monthly.\n\nSo what would you like the State\u2019s to take away from Ogun State?\n\nOne of the things that we\u2019ve done is the state fiscal responsibility plan which was a 21 point reform program for states and one of the things state\u2019s were required to do in exchange for help during the darkest part of the recession was to improve IGR.\n\nOne of the key metrics was to improve IGR and to come up with a plan for IGR that required things like reviewing obsolete tariffs, taking transactions cashless and improving their receipting, so we\u2019re seeing this replicated across a number of states and it has been quite exciting to see the increases in IGR across the length and breadth of the nation and that is really important in terms of fiscal responsibility for the state\u2019s because when we talk about not relying on oil we\u2019re not saying that the government should cut back we\u2019re saying that government should find another source of revenue and internally generated revenue for any state is a very very important part of that.\n\nLet\u2019s talk on the federal level. The Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration scheme, the deadline is almost here March 31st. Bring us up to speed on the progress so far?\n\nIncredible progress so far. The signs have been very very encouraging. We knew that everyone would wait until the last minute, which was something that we expected I was just speaking to the chairman of Inland revenue here in Ogun and he said look I am at N500million already and there are just a handful of people that have complied so the signs are very encouraging.\n\nFor us it proves that the data that we have and the analysis that we did are correct. We analysed the data and saw that people are clearly under declaring on a massive scale and so far I think at federal level just 226 people account for N20 billion so if you begin to extrapolate and think about the thousands of forms that are in circulation we expect that we will bring many many more people into the tax net correctly.\n\nIt is not just about paying the arrears of taxes that they should have paid but for us, what is more important is being taxed at the right level going forward.\n\nI know that there are still some people who won\u2019t come forward because they want to see if there\u2019s any bite from the side of the fiscal authorities so come March 31st. What is going to happen are you going to name and shame?\n\nWhat is going to happen is for personal taxes many of the states are working on using sort of mobile courts to fast track cases. They dont want cases to get caught up in the long legal process because tax evasion is a very easy and straight forward prosecution. They\u2019ve started looking at setting up special courts that deal with tax evasion.\n\nTax evasion is a crime and of course once people are prosecuted we feel that we should say this is the person that is being prosecuted for tax evasion and this is why so that it acts a deterrent to others. However, I am not sure that this is where our focus is.\n\nOur focus is really on getting everybody to do the right thin. These moneys were made in Nigeria and from Nigeria and it is only fair and right that some of that money is ploughed back into the system to allow some of that to go forward.\n\nSo what is going to happen after VAIDS?\n\nWe continue the focus on tax collection and we\u2019re going to focus on VAT. We\u2019re also going to focus on getting the number of tax payers up.\n\nAccording to the latest figures I\u2019ve got from the Federal Inland and Revenue Service, we are now at 17 million and that\u2019s a huge achievement because I believe we were at 13 million Nigerians when we came in.\n\nBut, there are 65 million people who are economically active so there\u2019s a long way to go. There is a lot of work still to be done in the tax system.\n\nVAIDS is just one of many reforms. The other reforms that we are working on are constant updates to our tax laws. Some of our tax laws are obsolete. We haven\u2019t updated them or come up to speed with different commercial realities.\n\nFor example, we have not got a strategy for taxing e-commerce. A lot of transactions are now happening online. How do we get them into our tax net? SO there is constant work to be done in our tax policy.\n\nBut is that in the works already?\n\nAbsolutely we have a national tax policy that FEC approved and we have a national committee that pulls together academia, the private sector, the public sector, and the collecting agents and they have policy meetings where they work and look at the tax laws and recommend changes.\n\nThe first set should hopelly go to FEC in the next couple of weeks and then from there they\u2019ll go to the national assembly so it is a constant process of upgrading and updating and making sure that our tax laws are not only effective but also ease the convenience in terms of payment.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about government debt. Bring us up to speed.\n\nThe first thing to say about our core debt strategy is that it remains conservative. In terms of debt to GDP ratio we are at 21. The upper limit for a developing economy is recommended at 40.\n\nSome of our neighbours not too far from here are as high as 60, some are at 80. Our debt to GDP ratio is very low and we intend to stay in the low range.\n\nHowever, there is a desperate need for investment and that investment has got to be financed and that investment is long term investment. The only way you can finance these things is through long term debt.\n\nOur needs to develop roads and power are prevalent and they are long term assets so we have to match them with long term liabilities.\n\nOur strategy as far as debt is concerned is to have longer term debt, which is why we refinanced treasury bills which mature in 120 \u2013 180 days and moved that to 20 -30 years.\n\nWe\u2019re matching the lifespan of the asset with the liability and as you pointed out previously by moving on to external debt we are creating head room for the private sector.\n\nWe are also creating head room for the monetary authorities. Hopefully when the conditions allow, they\u2019ll begin to bring down interest rates. It is all part of a comprehensive strategy.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian - Nigeria", "location": [{"country": "NG", "state": null, "city": "Abuja"}]}, {"author": "Denis Campbell Health Policy Editor", "body": "The government is set to offer around 1 million NHS staff a 6.5% pay rise over the next three years but is insisting that health workers give up a day\u2019s holiday in return for the \u00a33.3bn deal.\n\nMinisters hope they are close to finalising a package to give NHS personnel in England their first meaningful pay rise since 2010, after months of behind-the-scenes talks with union leaders.\n\nThe Treasury and Department of Health and Social Care plan to propose that all non-medical NHS staff across the UK receive a 3% increase in their salary in 2018-19 \u2013 the current rate of inflation \u2013 and then rises of 1%-2% in the following two years. Nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants, ambulance staff and all other workers except doctors and dentists would benefit from the scrapping of the hated pay cap. Doctors and dentists have a separate pay review system.\n\nThe deal the government is preparing to formally put to staff later this month would also see some NHS personnel get pay rises of 10% and, in certain circumstances, well above that by 2021. Those on the bottom of the NHS\u2019s nine pay scales would get a bigger uplift under Agenda for Change \u2013 the agreement that governs the earnings of health service staff \u2013 than colleagues who earn more because they are higher up that pay band.\n\nThe 14 health unions that have been negotiating the details of the government\u2019s offer, in conditions of strict secrecy, are cautiously optimistic they will feel able to recommend it and that their members, who include Unison, Royal College of Nursing, Unite, the GMB and Chartered Society of Physiotherapists, will endorse it.\n\nSources close to the talks say they have been constructive, businesslike and highly detailed, with both sides keen to see NHS staff pay improved as much as possible. A plan for the chancellor Philip Hammond to unveil the offer in his Spring Statement next Tuesday has been abandoned, however, as there are still some sticking points to be resolved.\n\nMinisters\u2019 determination that staff forfeit a day\u2019s holiday in return for the pay rise could derail the chances of the Treasury and unions agreeing a deal, especially if that provokes a backlash among staff, many of whom already do regular unpaid overtime and have seen their real incomes cut by up to 14% by the years of austerity-era tiny rises.\n\nBut government negotiators have made clear that staff working one extra day a year is a \u201cred line\u201d that for them is non-negotiable. If union members refuse to accept that, ministers will withdraw their offer in its entirety and may impose the 1% pay rise that was planned before anger at eight years of zero and 1% public sector pay rises proved so politically damaging for the Conservatives in last year\u2019s general election campaign.\n\nThe issue of NHS pay twice left Theresa May looking out of touch when she was quizzed on it live on television. On BBC1\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, she said there were \u201cmany complex reasons\u201d why people went to foodbanks when asked why some nurses were doing that. And she first insisted that \u201cthere\u2019s no magic money tree\u201d when confronted by an NHS nurse, only to find a \u00a31bn \u201cbribe\u201d to win the support of Democratic Unionist party MPs in key votes when her government lost its parliamentary majority.\n\nThe unions may be helped in selling the package to their members by ministers agreeing not to change their system of pay increments. Also known as \u201cprogression pay\u201d, this gives about half of staff 3% or 4% annual rises on top of their annual increase. Jeremy Hunt, the health and social care secretary, had signalled last autumn that it may be reworked to help deliver the \u201cproductivity improvements\u201d that Hammond was demanding as part of the deal to lift the paycap. That will now come from staff losing one of their 27 days annual holiday entitlement.\n\nSimon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, on Wednesday backed staff\u2019s plea for a pay rise after seven years of wage restraint and said action was needed in order to help tackle the service\u2019s growing problems in retaining staff. In a speech Stevens again made clear his view that the government should wholly fund whatever increase is finally decided, given the NHS\u2019s deep financial problems.\n\nNigel Edwards, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust thinktank, said: \u201cIf the government makes a proposal like that obtained by the Guardian, staff, especially those paid least, will welcome the respite from a real-term squeeze on their wages which has cost them billions. With very serious shortages of staff, government is right to conclude that an austerity approach to the NHS workforce has reached its limits.\u201d\n\nBut, Edwards added, losing a day\u2019s leave would in effect be a pay cut of 0.4%, even with the salary increase.\n\nProf Anita Charlesworth, director of research at the Health Foundation, said: \u201cThe NHS needs urgent action to turn around nurse recruitment and retention. One in 10 nursing posts are unfilled and an increasing number of staff are leaving the NHS.\n\n\u201cImproving pay, especially for those on lower incomes, is very important. However, pay is not a panacea. Nurses report that two of the most important factors causing them to leave the NHS are worries about quality of care and lack of work-life balance.

Bolton is the hawk\u2019s hawk, the neocon\u2019s neocon (though he rejects that label, preferring \u201cGoldwater conservative\u201d after the presidential candidate deemed too extreme by the American people in 1964). His published work includes \u201cTo Stop Iran\u2019s Bomb, Bomb Iran\u201d, \u201cThe Legal Case for Striking North Korea First\u201d and \u201cHow to Defund the UN\u201d. As George W Bush\u2019s under secretary of state for arms control he was a rabidly enthusiastic supporter of the invasion of Iraq, and seems never to have fallen out of love with the doctrine of intervention, despite the catastrophe he helped engineer.\n\nAs Trump re-ran the Apprentice but for the job of America\u2019s top diplomat, dangling the prize of secretary of state in front of Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani, Bolton\u2019s name was increasingly mentioned. But there was a sticking point: facial hair. \u201cDonald was not going to like that moustache,\u201d an associate of the president-elect told the Washington Post. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone that\u2019s really close to Donald that has a beard that he likes.\u201d\n\nBolton had fallen foul of the \u201cright out of central casting\u201d test. He didn\u2019t look the part, unlike the don\u2019t-mess-with-me-faced defence secretary James Mattis, or the bullet-headed national security adviser HR McMaster. That and the fact that the Republican Rand Paul vowed to block his appointment, which would have required Senate confirmation (\u201cHe should get nowhere close to the State Department.\u201d) As a result, he remained outside the inner circle, having to content himself with opining on Fox News. Until Thursday.\n\nBolton is now national security adviser-designate, after McMaster was fired (the position doesn\u2019t require congressional approval). And, once again, Trump\u2019s top team looks like a bunch of rats in a sack, with no internal coherence or logic. The president ran as an anti-interventionist, repeatedly complaining about all the money America spent fighting wars, particularly Iraq. His soft line on Russia couldn\u2019t be further from Bolton\u2019s antagonistic approach.\n\nSo what does moustache-man\u2019s promotion signal? Is there now going to be a decisive shift in favour of military intervention in Iran, North Korea and elsewhere, as Bolton would no doubt prefer?\n\n\n\nThe world is right to be nervous. But there is good reason to think that Bolton\u2019s tenure may not mark an ideological sea-change. There are many causes of the Trump administration\u2019s dysfunction. Prime among them is the idiosyncratic criteria the president applies to senior appointments. Candidates are not selected for their ability to all pull in one direction, with a grand strategy in mind. Nor for their intelligence or experience. Mattis didn\u2019t become defence secretary because of his erudition, but at least in part because Trump heard he was nicknamed \u201cMad Dog\u201d. McMaster wasn\u2019t chosen because of his book about the importance of military men challenging political leaders, but because Trump goes weak at the knees when he sees a three-star general. Bolton wasn\u2019t picked for his penchant for pre-emption, but because he regularly pops up on Trump\u2019s TV, which is almost always tuned to the same channel.\n\nAs he attempts to make his presence felt in the West Wing, Bolton is likely to meet resistance from Mattis and the president\u2019s chief of staff John Kelly, who are said to be \u201csceptical\u201d of him. And he appears to have struck some kind of bargain to moderate his bellicose instincts. One source told CNN\u2019s White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins that \u201cBolton promised Trump \u2018he wouldn\u2019t start any wars\u2019 if he selected him as the new national security adviser\u201d.\n\nBut even if he sticks to that somewhat pat promise, we can still expect him to exert influence over the president\u2019s thinking, particularly on Iran, where they two are more or less of the same mind. Both Rex Tillerson, recently sacked as secretary of state, and McMaster, were proponents of maintaining the Obama-era deal designed to put the brakes on Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme. Trump has made no secret of his disdain for it, and now he will be backed up to the hilt by his own national security adviser. So we can expect this enormous diplomatic achievement to be shredded, despite European efforts to the contrary. But \u201cbomb Iran\u201d?

The appointment of John Bolton as National Security Advisor \u2013 following the nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State \u2013 could be the beginning of Trump\u2019s march to war. Or wars.\n\nThe timing is not coincidental. In May, Trump will likely rip up the diplomatic agreement that has prevented Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, sparking a period of heightened tensions with Iran and removing one of the final barriers to escalating military conflict with Iran across the Middle East.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s upcoming summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un fails \u2013 as is highly likely \u2013 the next step could be preventive military action.\n\nTwo wars, on two fronts, with incalculable costs.\n\nIf you\u2019re not scared yet, you should be.

Not even years of catastrophe in Iraq after the invasion sobered Bolton\u2019s views: he said in 2015: \u201cI still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct.\u201d\n\nThat Trump \u2013 who claimed (falsely) to have opposed the Iraq War \u2013 named Bolton his national security advisor just days after the 15th anniversary of the beginning of the invasion of Iraq is some very sick irony.\n\nIran is in Bolton\u2019s sights. In 2015, Bolton wrote an op-ed advocating military strikes on Iran, claiming that: \u201cThe inconvenient truth is that only military action like Israel\u2019s 1981 attack on Saddam Hussein\u2019s Osirak reactor in Iraq or its 2007 destruction of a Syrian reactor, designed and built by North Korea, can accomplish what is required.\u201d\n\nAnd just when one thought that Trump\u2019s embrace of diplomacy with North Korea\u00a0might have indicated a new, more peaceful direction in US policy, Bolton\u2019s entrance to the White House should disabuse everyone of that notion. \n\n\n\nBolton supports preventive military strikes against North Korea: \u201cit is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current \u2018necessity\u2019 posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons by striking first.\u201d In a recent appearance on Fox News, Bolton appeared to hint that if Kim doesn\u2019t come to the table ready to hand over his nukes, military action could follow.\n\nSome may claim that this is yet another chaotic staff change in a White House where all staff is eventually discarded, and the only opinion that matters is that of Trump. And that may very well be true. But with such a reckless, impulsive president, all that stands between Trump and disastrous wars is a short meeting with his advisors to place the orders.\n\nThe appointment of John Bolton just moved America one very large step closer to that disastrous moment. Bolton may be a radical, but he\u2019s not incompetent. He\u2019s a weekly feature on Fox News, practically providing Trump his Presidential Daily Briefing. He is a highly skilled bureaucratic fighter. It doesn\u2019t take much to imagine Bolton in the Oval Office telling Trump to bomb Iran and North Korea; that Obama didn\u2019t have the guts to do it; that it will cement his place in history.\n\nThe job of the national security advisor is to work with the relevant US government agencies to compile policy options for the president. There\u2019s no reason to believe that Bolton will push anything but his own radical views, as illustrated by his cherry-picking of Iraq intelligence while at the State Department. With Mike Pompeo \u2013 a hawk on Iran and North Korea, and a true Trump enabler \u2013 likely headed to State, the internal obstacles to catastrophic military decisions are being removed.\n\nSecretary of Defense James Mattis \u2013 with his relatively moderate views on matters of war and peace \u2013 now could be the last man standing between America and the abyss.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nThis is not only a time for concern, but also for action. Every American needs to speak out against this appointment. While Bolton\u2019s new position does not require Senate confirmation (Bolton was so radical he could not get confirmed by a Republican Senate in 2005), Trump must hear a chorus of voices in Congress express grave concern and make clear that they will act to prevent Trump from starting unnecessary wars. \n\n\n\nThe Senate must vote down the nomination of Pompeo.

The memo reportedly claims the FBI had an anti-Trump bias when it sought a warrant from the US foreign intelligence surveillance court to collect intelligence on Carter Page, an adviser to the Trump campaign. The Fisa court is a secret court that examines law enforcement requests to surveil Americans who are suspected of acting as foreign agents.\n\nThe Republican memo reportedly alleges that the FBI relied on the Steele dossier, which was partly paid for using Democratic funds, in seeking the Carter Page warrant, according to the New York Times.\n\nDemocrats have said that the Republican allegations are misleading and based on selective use of classified materials. Justice Department officials have said the release of the document, because of the classified elements, would be \u201cextraordinarily reckless\u201d.\n\nTrump now has five days to decide whether the Nunes document should become public.\n\nThe Shearer memo was provided to the FBI in October 2016.\n\nIt was handed to them by Steele \u2013 who had been given it by an American contact \u2013 after the FBI requested the former MI6 agent provide any documents or evidence that could be useful in its investigation, according to multiple sources.\n\nThe Guardian was told Steele warned the FBI he could not vouch for the veracity of the Shearer memo, but that he was providing a copy because it corresponded with what he had separately heard from his own independent sources.\n\nAmong other things, both documents allege Donald Trump was compromised during a 2013 trip to Moscow that involved lewd acts in a five-star hotel.\n\nThe Shearer memo cites an unnamed source within Russia\u2019s FSB, the state security service. The Guardian cannot verify any of the claims.\n\nShearer is a controversial figure in Washington. Conservative outlets have accused him of being part of a \u201chatchet man\u201d and member of a \u201csecret spy ring\u201d and within Clinton\u2019s orbit. There is no evidence that the Clinton campaign was aware of the Shearer memo.\n\nBut other people who know Shearer say he is not just a Democratic party hack and there is no evidence that his memo was ever sought by Clinton campaign officials.\n\nSources say that while he lacks the precision and polish of a seasoned former spy like Steele, Shearer has also been described as having a large network of sources around the world and the independent financial means to pursue leads.\n\nThe White House has vigorously denied allegations that the US president was ever compromised and has rejected claims that campaign officials ever conspired with the Kremlin ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nSteele\u2019s dossier, his motives for writing it and his decision to share it remain controversial among Republicans.\n\nHe says he approached the FBI about concerns he had about links between Russia and the Trump campaign after he was commissioned to investigate the matter by a private investigative firm called Fusion GPS on behalf of the firm\u2019s clients.\n\nGlenn Simpson, the founder of Fusion GPS, told congressional investigators that Steele approached the FBI out of a sense of duty and concern for US national security.\n\nRepublican supporters of Trump have derided it as \u201cfake news\u201d. Chuck Grassley, a Republican senator from Iowa and ally of Trump, has called for an investigation into Steele amid unspecified allegations about the former spy\u2019s conduct.\n\nDemocrats have said the campaign against Steele is part of an effort to seek to discredit him in order to shift attention away from allegations about Trump and Russia.\n\nA spokesman for the US special counsel leading the criminal investigation into the Trump campaign declined to comment. Shearer did not return emails and calls for comment.\n\nA federal criminal investigation into the Trump campaign has so far resulted in four indictments.

Many of the same characters, some of the same tactics.\n\nAt the heart of it all \u2013 data analytics company, SCL \u2013 the parent company of Cambridge Analytica. It had been hired by a rich Nigerian who supported the incumbent, President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\n\u201cIt was the kind of campaign that was our bread and butter,\u201d says one ex-employee. \u201cWe\u2019re employed by a billionaire who\u2019s panicking at the idea of a change of government and who wants to spend big to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nThis was a standard variation on what SCL had done around the world for 30 years \u2013 this time, with a twist. Weaponising information to harm an opponent was standard methodology.\n\nIt was a methodology honed and developed in the company\u2019s defence and military work \u2013 the fifth dimension of warfare, defined by the US military as \u201cinformation operations\u201d.\n\nWhat was new, or at least new to those employees who have now spoken out, was bringing these techniques to the company\u2019s election work.\n\nSeven individuals with close knowledge of the Nigeria campaign have described how Cambridge Analytica worked with people they believed were Israeli computer hackers.\n\nThe sources \u2013 who spoke to the Observer over many months \u2013 said the company was looking for \u201ckompromat\u201d on Muhammadu Buhari \u2013 at the time, leader of the opposition.\n\nThey said the hackers offered Cambridge Analytica access to private information about Buhari.\n\nTheir testimony paints an extraordinary picture of how far a western company would contemplate going in an effort to undermine the democratic process in a country that already struggles to provide free and fair elections.\n\nTheir claims are disputed by the company, which insists it did not take possession of or use any personal information for any purpose and did not use any \u201chacked or stolen data\u201d.\n\nThe company confirmed, however, that it had been hired to provide \u201cadvertising and marketing services in support of the Goodluck Jonathan campaign\u201d.\n\nThat work seems to have come about through Brittany Kaiser, a senior director at Cambridge Analytica, who would go on to play a public role at the launch of Nigel Farage\u2019s Leave.eu campaign, and a senior strategist on the Trump campaign.\n\nRegarded by colleagues as a prolific networker, in December 2014 she was introduced to a Nigerian oil billionaire who wanted to fund a covert campaign to support Jonathan.\n\nAn ex-employee said: \u201c[Kaiser] got a phone call. It was just before Christmas and she flew out to meet them in Washington DC. It was all a bit ridiculous. It was only six to eight weeks before the election and they were looking to spend nearly $2m.\u201d\n\nThe election was a big deal. At stake, the future of the most populous country in Africa, and potential access to its lucrative oil reserves. The sitting president was favourite to win, though Buhari was doing unexpectedly well.\n\nNot least because his team had hired AKPD, once the firm of former Barack Obama strategist David Axelrod, which was pushing a slick, social media heavy Obama-esque message of hope.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of scared millionaires worried that Buhari would get in. It was all very last-minute. A team flew out to Abuja and put together a communications campaign. It was a straightforward, normal comms campaign in most respects,\u201d the employee said.\n\nMost but not all respects. The Observer has obtained an astonishing and disturbing video that Cambridge Analytica used in the campaign.\n\n\u201cComing to Nigeria on February 15th, 2015,\u201d the voiceover says in the manner of a trailer for a Hollywood movie.\n\n\u201cDark. Scary. And very uncertain. Sharia for all.\u201d And then it poses the question: \u201cWhat would Nigeria look like if sharia were imposed by Buhari?\u201d\n\nIts answer to that question is certainly dark. And scary. It\u2019s also graphically, brutally, violent. One minute and 19 seconds of archive news footage from Nigeria\u2019s troubled past set to a horror movie soundtrack.\n\nThere are scenes of people being macheted to death. Their legs hacked off. Their skulls caved in. A former contractor said: \u201cIt was voter suppression of the most crude and basic kind. It was targeted at Buhari voters in Buhari regions to basically scare the shit out of them and stop them from voting.\u201d\n\nIf Buhari wins, the film warns: women would wear the veil. Sharia law would be introduced. And the inference is, you may be macheted to death.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just videos spreading fear. The Cambridge Analytica campaign team in Nigeria were jumpy too.\n\n\u201cIt felt risky, being there. There were various points when we were told we were in danger.\u201d And in the Abuja hotel to which the team was confined in early 2015, rumours abounded.\n\nThe tales are Graham Greene-esque. The hotel was where slick western consultants, including a team from the now disgraced Bell Pottinger, partied with their Nigerian counterparts. Mingling among them, western intelligence operatives - state backed, or privately commissioned, nobody was quite sure.\n\nAnd then there were the meetings: three sources have told the Guardian about one that took place between Cambridge Analytica employees and two people they were told were Israeli intelligence operatives.\n\n\u201cThere was a two-hour meeting that took place in the hotel lobby between two senior campaign members and Israeli intelligence. After which they swept our hotel rooms for listening devices and said they would switch out our phones. The story we were told was that there were intelligence agents from a number of different countries, including Israel and France, who were supporting Goodluck Jonathan and helping the campaigns.\u201d\n\nThere is no suggestion that Jonathan was aware of or implicated in this support. Another employee said: \u201cBasically the Israelis didn\u2019t want [Buhari] to win.\u201d\n\nOther employees questioned whether they were \u201creal\u201d Israeli intelligence operatives, or Israeli private contractors.\n\nA few weeks later, as the campaign was drawing to a close, there was another meeting at Cambridge Analytica\u2019s London office.\n\nAn expert had flown in from Israel with a laptop, sources say.\n\nAnd Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica\u2019s now suspended CEO, and Kaiser, asked employees to take a thumb drive and download the contents on to their own computers.\n\nThe content was private emails and the information, they were told, related to Buhari\u2019s financial and medical records.\n\nOne employee who was present at the London meeting said he had initially assumed the visiting expert was Mossad or Israeli intelligence passing on what he called \u201clegtimate information\u201d.\n\nBut he began to realise this wasn\u2019t the case, he said, when he saw the reaction of his colleagues. One of them had \u201cfreaked out\u201d, he said. \u201cHe was like, \u2018What the fuck? I don\u2019t want anything to do with this.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe witnesses are clear \u2013 at least in their own minds. The information they were shown had come from hackers.\n\nBack in Nigeria, the team still on the ground found out what was going on from their colleagues in London. There was more \u201cfreaking out\u201d. This time with live, pressing concerns.\n\n\u201cThey were fucking scared,\u201d said a colleague who spoke to them while they were in the country. The campaign fixer, the person with local knowledge who navigated them through the ins and outs of Nigerian politics, made it clear to them: they needed to get out of the country right away.\n\nCambridge Analytica had put them all in danger, they said. If opposition supporters found out, there was no saying what might happen.\n\nOne member of the team missed his flight and instead of asking the office to re-book it, he got the first fight out \u2013 to Dubai \u2013 and put it on his credit card. \u201cEveryone just wanted to get out as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the company said its team remained in country throughout the original campaigning period had \u201cleft in accordance with the company\u2019s campaign plan\u201d.\n\n\u201cTeam members were regularly briefed about security concerns prior to and during deployment and measures were taken to ensure the team\u2019s safety throughout.\u201d\n\nThere are multiple wider political questions about what went on in the Nigerian election of 2015 and the role western powers played. Whether western political campaigners taking lucrative foreign contracts are contributing to the democratic framework of developing countries \u2013 or helping to destroy them. If they\u2019re experimenting with methods and techniques that they later re-import back to our more developed democracies.\n\nChristopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower who spoke to the Observer, called it \u201cpost-colonial blowback\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe west found a way of firehosing disinformation into weak and vulnerable democracies. And now this has been turned back on us. This really is about our chickens coming home to roost.\u201d\n\nAnother said: \u201cEverything the company did after the Mercers got involved was about refining a set of techniques that they would go on to use in the US elections. These campaigns in other countries were experiments. They worked out how to harvest data and weaponise it. And they got steadily better at it.\u201d\n\nAnd what comes across most strongly, the sources say, is how little thought, if any, the senior directors in London had given to their employees and colleagues who became caught up in the activities, many of whom were in their early to mid-20s.\n\nOne member of staff who met the Israelis in the office on another occasion described them as \u201cspecial forces\u201d types. He said: \u201cThey were cliche alpha males with a certain intellect. Looked military, very composed. They looked like they could beat the crap out of you.\u201d\n\nThree years on, there is still stress in some of their voices when they recount these stories. Stress and fear and anger \u2013 about the danger they put in, and the lack of care shown toward them, the morally compromising position they were put in, the lack of knowledge they had about what sort of the company they would be working for when they took their jobs.\n\nIt\u2019s why, despite the personal risks, so many of them agreed to speak.\n\n\u201cWhen I took that job, I did not sign up to any of this,\u201d said one. Three years on, he is still angry and shocked and fearful. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what this company is capable of,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a statement, SCL Elections, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, confirmed it had been hired in December 2014 in support of the Jonathan campaign.\n\n\u201cWe can confirm that SCL Elections was hired in December 2014 to provide advertising and marketing services in support of the Goodluck Jonathan campaign.\u201d\n\nAsked specifically about the meetings in which staff described being asked to transfer personal information that they believed had been hacked, the firm said: \u201cDuring an election campaign, it is normal for SCL Elections to meet with vendors seeking to provide services as a subcontractor.\n\n\u201cSCL Elections did not take possession of or use any personal information from such individuals for any purposes.

It began with a focus on voter suppression in Nigeria, and Cambridge Analytica also discussed \u201cmicro-targeting\u201d individuals on social media during elections.\n\nThe revelations come at a time of intense US scrutiny of Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, with 13 Russians criminally charged last month with interfering to help Donald Trump.\n\nIn Britain, concerns about Russian propaganda have been mounting, with the prime minister, Theresa May, recently attacking Russia for spreading fake news, accusing Moscow of attempts to \u201cweaponise information\u201d and influence polls.\n\nLukoil, Russia\u2019s second-largest oil company, discussed with Cambridge Analytica the data company\u2019s powerful social media marketing system, which was already being deployed for Republican Ted Cruz in the US presidential primaries and was later used to back Brexit and Trump.\n\nAlexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, emailed colleagues after initial contacts to say that Lukoil wanted a clearer explanation of \u201chow our services are going to apply to the petroleum business\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey understand behavioural micro-targeting in the context of elections (as per your excellent document/white paper) but they are failing to make the connection between voters and their consumers,\u201d he wrote in an email seen by the Observer.\n\nA slide presentation prepared for the Lukoil pitch focuses first on election disruption strategies used by Cambridge Analytica\u2019s parent company, SCL, in Nigeria.

This is the good news on the Brexit front. It will take two years. The voyage will be stormy and the destination messy. But plus-or-minus Norway offers the only sensible way for Britain through the Brexit morass. Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn and Keir Starmer agree. Nick Clegg agrees. Most of the cabinet and the Tories\u2019 remainers publicly or privately agree. So do those close to the Brussels negotiations. They still seem unable to shake hands on it, but they will soon.\n\nThe week has been full of hopeful signs. On Monday the EU\u2019s Michel Barnier \u2013 a secret \u201cNorwegian\u201d \u2013 could not conceal his glee at his cobbled-together transition deal, nor could his British counterpart, David Davis.\n\nThe deal was a document of the most brutal realism. For now, the UK remains a non-participating member of the single market, with freedom of movement and right of settlement. Farmers and fishers are \u201cas you were\u201d. Britain can discuss \u201coffshore\u201d trade deals, but not agree them. Hard Brexiteers can go jump off a cliff.\n\nThe smart money in Brussels was always on the Norway option. The so-called European Economic Area was a simple \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d basis for a bespoke deal with the UK. The challenge lay not in negotiating it but in overcoming Theresa May\u2019s belief that her fate depended on some 50 backbench leavers and the editors of the Sun and the Daily Mail. She was terrified of them.\n\nEven so, the assumption was that, as the March 2019 deadline approached and the impossibility of a \u201cfrictionless\u201d hard Brexit became ever clearer, Theresa May would be forced into a series of tactical retreats. The tough Lancaster House and Florence speeches, and Chequers last month, were dollops of fudge to keep hard Brexiteers on board. But this week\u2019s transition deal would mark a parting of the ways. So it has appeared. The sight of Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and assorted friends shuffling miserably into line, whimpering over dead fish, was heart-warming. So in a sense has been May\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s distraction over Russian poison, hysterically comparing Vladimir Putin to Stalin and Hitler.\n\nA detailed analysis of the Norway option in last month\u2019s Economist was unequivocally favourable. Norway in 1994 went through the same referendum debate as Britain, with the same drift towards compromise. The country remained in the European Free Trade Association (Efta). It stayed open to a single European market in goods, capital and labour, but it held aloof from the common fisheries and agriculture policies. Norway also stayed outside the EU customs union, to secure its own trade deals elsewhere. It is hard to see what substantive argument a Brexiter could have against this.\n\nNorway fiercely denies it is a \u201cvassal state\u201d. It is rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the \u201cmost democratic\u201d in the world. It must abide by EU rules on trade in goods within the EU. But so must EU members, who can be overruled by majority voting. On matters of joint concern, such as energy, Norway is consulted and heard. Its lobbying office next to the Berlaymont building is more effective than any council vote. As for the European court, the Efta court liaises with it and is rarely in conflict.\n\nTrade in services and finance is more crucial to the UK than in goods, and here both Europe and the world would remain its oyster, as this EU single market is in its infancy. As for migration, Efta arrangements embrace a register of EU nationals, controls on their citizenship and property ownership and expulsion if they are out of work for six months. A mere 20% of Norwegians regret their Efta status. Of course Norway is smaller than the UK. But the issue is whether its model is practicable. It is.\n\nThe one argument against the Norway option for Britain is that it would lie outside the customs union. How valuable this freedom is to Norway\u2019s economy is moot. Efta has laboriously reached deals with 38 countries, including Canada. But it requires a hard border with Sweden to enforce country-of-origin controls. Since such a border is anathema in Northern Ireland, Norway plus customs union with the EU makes sense. I have seen no calculation that shows an advantage to UK trade in being outside one.\n\nYes, Britain would pay into the EU for all this, as does Norway. But Norway\u2019s money is carefully earmarked for grants, scholarships and projects. Likewise there are disciplines with \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d within an EU single market. But they did not worry Thatcher when she co-invented the market in 1985. Leaving the EU would usefully repatriate some controls, as over farming, construction standards, procurement and the environment. Britain, like Norway, could opt out of fish quotas. But these are trading practicalities not issues of principle. They are about how to make the best of \u201cthe decision to leave\u201d, not about following a neo-imperial will-o\u2019-the-wisp.\n\nWhat Britons thought they were \u201cleaving\u201d in 2016 remains opaque. No replacement question was asked. Britain will withdraw from the EU, but what takes its place must be a decision for parliament. Everything we read from polls and surveys suggests there is no majority for trade barriers at Calais or a ban on European care workers or plumbers. Public opinion wants soft Brexit. It wants Norway.\n\nThe last time Norway featured prominently in the Commons was in 1940. British failure against the Nazis cost Chamberlain his job, but these events formed the basis for victory and reconstruction. Sooner or later, the Commons will debate Norway again: whether the UK should remain within a single market and customs union, however camouflaged. When that happens, May will drive her hard Brexiters into sullen acceptance or resignation. But she can tell them her hands have been tied to a Norwegian mast. If so, history could regard her twisting and tacking, her softly, softly Brexit strategy as the most brilliant of political manoeuvres.

In truth, we now confront the frightening image of Trump Unchained, like a fugitive from a low-rent 1960s movie about Hercules.\n\nAll signs from the White House suggest that Trump is going to war on multiple fronts. The Bolton bombshell came just hours after the president\u2019s lead attorney, the often conciliatory John Dowd, resigned in frustration over Trump\u2019s brass-knuckle attacks on special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nIf Trump fires Mueller, it would, of course, prompt the biggest constitutional crisis since Watergate. But, at least, on the Mueller front, no nuclear weapons would be launched, except as over-wrought metaphors.\n\nAlas, Bolton as national security adviser would come equipped with a war-fighting capacity that goes far beyond mere words. Nothing is more chilling than the argument for attacking North Korea that Bolton sketched out in a Wall Journal op-ed just a few weeks ago, \u201cThe threat is imminent, and the case against pre-emption rests on the misinterpretation of a standard that derives from prenuclear, pre-ballistic-missile times.\u201d\n\nBolton\u2019s why-we-can\u2019t-wait approach might have been justified when Nikita Khrushchev was moving Soviet missiles into Cuba. But Bolton, who was a zealot about Saddam Hussein\u2019s supposedly fearsome arsenal, is now hyperventilating over a brutal, but tin-pot, despot who appears to be reaching a modus vivendi with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. \n\n\n\nMaybe if the 69-year-old Bolton had served in the military (he supported the Vietnam war from afar ... at Yale Law School), he might have learned that so-called surgical strikes can quickly degenerate into bloody messes. Instead, it is easy to imagine Bolton pressing for military action against North Korea, Iran and Venezuela all in one go.\n\nGeorge W Bush had his Axis of Evil. Bolton comes into the White House with his own Axis of Impatience.\n\nIn prior administrations, national security advisers like Condoleezza Rice regarded themselves as honest brokers between dueling factions in the cabinet. The only thing honest about Bolton is his ill-concealed contempt for traditional diplomacy. In late 2015, Bolton proposed in the Boston Globe that all future US contributions to the UN should be voluntary, depending entirely on the national mood.\n\nWith Marco Rubio, the Senate\u2019s version of a human weathervane, praising Bolton as \u201can excellent choice\u201d, not even the terminally naive expect Republicans in Congress to limit Trump\u2019s militaristic impulses. A brave bipartisan Senate effort this week to challenge the brutal and legally dicey war in Yemen mustered only 44 votes.\n\nI recently asked a senior congressional Republican why Congress is so willing to defer to Trump\u2019s clownish foreign policy antics. The honest response: \u201cMost of them feel like they don\u2019t know enough.\u201d\n\nThe only presidential parallel to Trump is Millard Fillmore, who tried to regain the White House in 1856 as the nominee of the anti-immigrant Know-Nothing party.

Marielle Franco, a city councilwoman and human rights defender, was shot four times in the head by unknown assailants in a passing vehicle shortly after leaving a gathering of young black\u00a0activists. Her driver, Anderson Pedro Gomes, was also killed (Report, 16 March).\n\nLong before being elected to Rio\u2019s city council in 2016, Marielle was widely known as a tireless and fearless advocate for the rights of Afro-Brazilians, LGBT people, women and low-income communities. A gay black woman born and raised in one of Rio\u2019s poorest neighbourhoods, she campaigned relentlessly against spiralling police violence in the city\u2019s favelas.\n\nMarielle\u2019s activism earned\u00a0her many powerful enemies. She vehemently challenged the impunity surrounding extrajudicial killings of black youth by security forces and, two days before her death, had denounced the police\u2019s role in the killing of a young black man named Matheus Melo. She\u00a0was a leading critic of the military\u00a0intervention in Rio de Janeiro and was the head of a city commission tasked with monitoring the intervention.\n\nWe are deeply concerned and shocked by this commando-style killing of a woman who was a voice for the voiceless and a symbol of resistance to state-perpetrated violence, militarisation and anti-democratic forces. Given that Marielle\u2019s murder bears all the hallmarks of a targeted assassination, we call for the creation of an independent commission comprised of prominent and respected national and international human rights and legal experts and tasked with carrying out an independent investigation of the murder of Marielle Franco with the full cooperation of state judicial and police authorities.\n\nShortly before her death, Marielle asked: \u201cHow many others will have to die before this war will end?\u201d We call for justice for Marielle Franco and the daughter and the partner she leaves behind, and for an end to the killings and criminalisation of activists, government opponents and low-income people in Brazil.\n\nAva DuVernay Film-maker\n\nRev Jesse Jackson Civil

produced by Conservatives in Havering, on the eastern edge of Greater London, warns that if Labour win in May\u2019s local polls, it would result in \u201cHavering resembling boroughs like Hackney, Newham, Camden and Barking, rather than traditional parts of Essex\u201d.\n\nOther warnings on the leaflet, which features the three local Conservative councillors and Andrew Rosindell, the local Tory MP, include the claim that a Labour win would mean \u201cHavering ruled by Mayor Khan\u201d.\n\nThis would lead Romford, the main centre in Havering to \u201cbecome increasingly like an inner-city area\u201d with \u201cour cherished union jack flag being taken down \u2013 back to Labour\u2019s political correctness\u201d, it said.\n\nDavid Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, called the leaflet \u201cone long dog whistle about race\u201d, saying it marked a return to the controversial tactics used against Khan when he defeated Zac Goldsmith to become mayor in May 2016.\n\nGoldsmith was heavily criticised, including by some Conservatives, for repeatedly raising what he said were Khan\u2019s previous links to extreme Muslim figures and for not being sufficiently tough on Islamist terrorism.\n\nAndrew Boff, a senior London Conservative, said Goldsmith\u2019s tactics, which were supported by David Cameron, then the prime minister, and his ministers, had \u201cdone real damage\u201d to community relations.\n\nLammy said: \u201cThis is a really nasty leaflet from the Tory party in London and a return to the deeply divisive politics that failed so spectacularly during the 2016 mayoral campaign.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a genius to realise this leaflet is one long dog whistle about race and the diversity that the vast majority of Londoners are so proud of. The Tory party clearly haven\u2019t changed. Theresa May should condemn this leaflet and apologise to all Londoners immediately.\u201d\n\n\n\nRosindell has raised culture-based arguments before. Writing in his local newspaper at the end of last year, he described Havering as \u201ca borough that upholds our traditions in celebrating St George\u2019s day, armed forces day and proudly flies the union jack from our town hall 365 days of the year\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe choice for the people of Havering in next year\u2019s town hall elections is whether we want to keep what we have and retain the special character of Havering or allow ourselves to become just another lump of Sadiq Khan\u2019s inner London.\u201d\n\nRosindell said he rejected the idea of any bias, saying the leaflet did not mention race and was only seeking to raise awareness of high-density building projects that could take place under a Labour-run council.\n\n\n\n\u201cHavering is a very happy community with almost no racial tensions,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Labour are attempting to deliberately misinterpret campaigns against the mayor\u2019s policies on closing police stations and high-density building as a race issue then they should be ashamed in doing so.\n\n\u201cHavering is not inner London and his policies should reflect the needs of outer London areas too, but he neglects areas like Havering.\u201d\n\nOther Labour MPs have been angered by the approach adopted by some Conservatives towards Khan. \n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Nadine Dorries, the Conservative MP, quoted a tweet by the mayor calling for action on hate speech, saying: \u201cHow about, \u2018it\u2019s time to act on sex abusing grooming gangs,\u2019 instead?\u201d adding tags related to the abuse scandals in Telford and Rotherham.\n\nThis prompted Wes Streeting, the Labour MP for Ilford North, to accuse Dorries of expressing \u201cthinly veiled prejudice\u201d.\n\nLate last year, Conservative councillors in another outer London borough, Barnet, discussed a motion describing Khan as \u201can enemy of the people of Barnet\u201d.\n\nArjun Mittra, a Labour member of the council, condemned the term as \u201cdeeply historically loaded\u201d and reminiscent of Goldsmith\u2019s campaign.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Carole Cadwalladr Marc Silver Mustafa Khalili Charlie Phillips Ash Jenkins Jess Search Sandra Whipham Oliver Rivers", "body": "Shahmir Sanni, who worked for the official Vote Leave campaign, today breaks cover to raise concerns that the group behind the knife-edge 2016 vote in favour of Brexit \u2013 including key figures now working for Theresa May in Downing Street \u2013 may have broken the law by flouting referendum spending rules and then attempting to destroy evidence.\n\nSanni claims that a donation of \u00a3625,000 was made by Vote Leave to an independent referendum campaign organisation called BeLeave.

It is a grotesquely under-reported national scandal, lost amid a hysterical Tory campaign to delegitimise the Labour party with false allegations of treason. If Labour had received \u00a3820,000 from Russian-linked oligarchs and companies in the past 20 months \u2013 and indeed \u00a33m since 2010 \u2013 the media outrage would be deafening. But this is the Tory party, so there are no cries of treachery, of being in league with a hostile foreign power, of threatening the nation\u2019s security.\n\nWhen questioned about the Tories\u2019 Russian cash, our chancellor, Philip Hammond, pointedly refused to return the money. \u201cThere are people in this country who are British citizens, who are of Russian origin,\u201d he protested. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should taint them, or should tar them, with Putin\u2019s brush.\u201d How noble: a Tory who finally takes on the demonising of migrants. Before we get out the bunting, though, let\u2019s look at one donation as an example. It was 2014, and Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of Russia\u2019s former deputy finance minister, paid the princely sum of \u00a3160,000 to play tennis with David Cameron and Boris Johnson. In total, since 2012 \u2013 when the Electoral Commission initially declared her an \u201cimpermissible donor\u201d, before subsequently allowing her to donate \u2013 she has handed the Tories \u00a3514,000.\n\nI put it to you gently that if Labour took half a million pounds from the wife of a former Cuban minister, there would be no debate about whether this represented a scandalous financial relationship with the Cuban regime. Other examples include \u00a3400,000 from G\u00e9rard Lopez, a businessmen on the board of a company that partnered with Russia banks that had sanctions imposed on them during the Ukraine crisis.\n\nIt goes further than that. By last October, Tory MPs had taken four times more money from Russia\u2019s state-run Russia Today TV channel than Labour MPs: it is welcome that the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has said that his colleagues should no longer appear on the channel. The Conservative party is notoriously dependent on donations from the financial sector. The tens of millions of pounds poured into the Tories\u2019 war chest are not offered as acts of charity and munificence.\n\nIn 2011, for example, the Financial Times reported that \u201ceven donors admit that Tory MPs\u2019 desire to cut the 50p top rate of income tax is because these rich City donors are so close to the party\u201d. This same City of London is awash with dodgy money from Russia. No wonder, then, that in 2014 a secret government document revealed plans to stop any sanctions against Russia that might damage the City. Labour has attempted to introduce legislation that could prevent certain Russian individuals entering Britain or block their assets: how mysterious, then, that the Tories blocked it for \u201ctechnical reasons\u201d.\n\nThen there are the links to other regimes that combine contempt for human rights with a threat to our national security. Take Saudi Arabia, ruled by a totalitarian, fanatical regime that likes to slice the heads off gay men and dissidents, which treats women with what can only be described as barbarism, and which exports international extremism. In the two years or so after it began bombing Yemen \u2013 including with British weapons \u2013 Tory MPs received \u00a399,396 from the Saudi regime in the form of gifts, travel expenses and consultancy fees. Hammond was one of them: he received a watch worth nearly two grand from the Saudi ambassador.\n\nIn the past five years, moreover, Saudi Arabia and other autocracies spent \u00a3700,000 on luxury trips for MPs, more than 80% of whom were Tories. Just under \u00a3200,000 of that was money from Saudi Arabia to pay for the excursions of 41 MPs, 40 of whom were Conservatives. Now why would they possibly be doing that? Could it be \u2013 given that MPs receive nothing from our democratic allies for such trips \u2013 that this is part of a clear PR offensive, an attempt to secure influence over the Conservative government?\n\nIndeed, Rehman Chishti \u2013 the newly appointed vice-chair of the Conservative party \u2013 received \u00a32,000 a month from the Riyadh-based King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies between March 2016 and January 2018. Although the parliamentary commissioner for standards saw no reason to take action, it is worth noting his rampant pro-Saudi dictatorship sympathies. His Twitter feed includes boasting of being congratulated by the Saudi dictator for being re-elected as an MP in 2015, hosting lectures by Saudi officials, and leading Tory parliamentary delegations to Saudi Arabia. His colleague, Daniel Kawczynski, goes on TV to justify the barbaric Saudi assault on Yemen, crows about writing the \u201cmost pro-Saudi book ever written by a British politician\u201d, but then threatened to sue when this was linked with a trip worth \u00a36,722.14 paid for by the Saudi regime.\n\nAnd then there is the Tories\u2019 financial heart. The Qatari dictatorship owns three times more property in London than the Queen, and more than the mayoralty. Indeed, the Qatar Investment Authority owns Canary Wharf, the Shard and Harrods. Let\u2019s be clear: the Qatari regime has backed extremist and terrorist organisations, as have wealthy individuals under its jurisdiction. As Paddy Ashdown put it in November 2015, David Cameron failed to put sufficient pressure on Qatar and Saudi Arabia to stop funding extremism, leading Ashdown to \u201cworry about the closeness between the Conservative party and rich Arab Gulf individuals\u201d. Consider Theresa May\u2019s refusal to publish a report on foreign funding of extremism. Well, it would hardly go down well with the Gulf states, which are so deeply embedded in Tory milieus, would it?\n\nWhat a farce. We had rolling daily coverage smearing Jeremy Corbyn as a traitor based on the testimonies of a single crank from the former Czechoslovakia. And yet the Tories are at the centre of a web spun by the Russian and Gulf regimes. Hundreds of diners in Salisbury are now washing their belongings after traces of a nerve agent was found at Zizzi restaurant, suspected to be the location where a Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned. Our country is on a perpetual state of high alert because of the threat of international terrorism.\n\nHow is it morally acceptable for the Tories to take the Russian or Saudi shilling?

However, there has been widespread online push-back in China since it was announced on Sunday on the eve of an annual political congress in Beijing.\n\nIn a blog post, Victor Mair, a University of Pennsylvania China expert, said censors had taken \u201cquick, drastic action\u201d after \u201cthe internet was flooded with complaints\u201d.\n\nAccording to a list compiled by the China Digital Times website, search terms blocked on Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter, included:\n\n- \u2018Ten thousand years\u2019 (\u4e07\u5c81), which is China\u2019s way of saying: \u2018Long live!\u2019 or \u2018Viva!\u2019\n\n- \u2018Xi Zedong\u2019 (\u4e60\u6cfd\u4e1c) - a hybrid of the names of Xi and Chairman Mao Zedong\n\n\n\nThe name Yuan Shikai, a Qing dynasty warlord who unsuccessfully tried to restore monarch to China, was also banned as were the titles of two George Orwell books, 1984 and Animal Farm. \n\n\n\nLess clear is why censors took issue with the letter \u2018N\u2019. Mair speculated it was \u201cprobably out of fear on the part of the government that \u2018N\u2019 = \u2018n terms in office\u2019, where possibly n > 2\u201d.\n\nCharlie Smith, the alias of the founder of GreatFire.org, a group which helps users track and bypass Chinese censorship, said he found that explanation plausible.\n\n\u201c[Censors] probably determined it was sensitive and then moved to add that content to the blacklist so others would not be able to post something similar,\u201d he said, noting that the seditious symbol had now been emancipated.\n\n\u201cI doubt that they actually put that much thought into it so sadly, the letter \u2018N\u2019 was a temporary victim of this rash decision.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Beijing accused the west of reacting \u201chysterically\u201d to the scrapping of presidential term limits.\n\n\u201cNo sooner had [the party] made public its proposal \u2026 than the Western media began bad-mouthing China in their usual and various ways, the party-run Global Times tabloid said in an editorial.\n\n\u201cIt is worth noting that for some time the Western media have been growing strident in their abuse of Beijing, almost using curse words,\u201d the newspaper added, claiming those behind the criticism hoped to see \u201cChina crumble\u201d. \n\n\n\nSmith said he believed Beijing had underestimated the outrage its decision would cause. \u201cThe response from Chinese netizens indicates that Xi may have miscalculated how this would be received by the general public. Hence, he has asked the censors to put in overtime and things like the letter \u2018N\u2019 end up as collateral damage.\u201d\n\nFor now, censors might feel they had the situation under control. \u201cBut if the momentum continues to build and netizens continue to look for other ways to express their displeasure with Xi, we could reach a critical point where the authorities might have to consider \u2018turning off\u2019 the internet, however they might do that,\u201d Smith added. \n\n\n\n\u201cNow, more than any other time in recent history, those who are in a position to help Chinese netizens freely express their opinions and freely access information should step up and lend a hand.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Spencer Ackerman In New York", "body": "The director of the Central Intelligence Agency, John Brennan, issued an extraordinary apology to leaders of the US Senate intelligence committee on Thursday, conceding that the agency employees spied on committee staff and reversing months of furious and public denials.\n\nBrennan acknowledged that an internal investigation had found agency security personnel transgressed a firewall set up on a CIA network, which allowed Senate committee investigators to review agency documents for their landmark inquiry into CIA torture.\n\nAmong other things, it was revealed that agency officials conducted keyword searches and email searches on committee staff while they used the network.\n\n\n\nThe admission brings Brennan\u2019s already rocky tenure at the head of the CIA under renewed question. One senator on the panel said he had lost confidence in the director, although the White House indicated its support for a man who has been one of Barack Obama\u2019s most trusted security aides.\n\nCIA spokesman Dean Boyd acknowledged that agency staff had improperly monitored the computers of committee staff members, who were using a network the agency had set up, called RDINet. \u201cSome CIA employees acted in a manner inconsistent with the common understanding reached between [the committee] and the CIA in 2009 regarding access to the RDINet,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if Brennan had or would offer his resignation, a different CIA spokesman, Ryan Trapani, replied: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nIn March, the committee chairwoman, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, accused the agency of violating constitutional boundaries by spying on the Senate.\n\nFeinstein said the vindication, from CIA inspector general David Buckley, and Brennan\u2019s apology were \u201cpositive first steps,\u201d suggesting that the director had further work to do before she would consider the matter closed.\n\nShe stopped short of calling for Brennan\u2019s resignation. But her committee colleague, Democrat Mark Udall of Colorado, said Brennan should go. \u201cI have no choice but to call for the resignation of CIA director John Brennan,\u201d Udall said after a briefing on the inspector general\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cThe CIA unconstitutionally spied on Congress by hacking into Senate intelligence committee computers. This grave misconduct is not only illegal, but it violates the US constitution\u2019s requirement of separation of powers. These offenses, along with other errors in judgment by some at the CIA, demonstrate a tremendous failure of leadership, and there must be consequences.\n\nBoyd, the CIA spokesman, said Brennan has asked a former committee member, Evan Bayh, a former Indiana Democratic senator, to lead an \u201caccountability board\u201d reviewing Buckley\u2019s report and to advise Brennan on next steps.\n\n\n\nThat advice, Boyd said, \u201ccould include potential disciplinary measures and/or steps to address systemic issues.\u201d\n\nSteve Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists, a longtime observer of the CIA, called its Thursday statement a \u201cconciliatory gesture\u201d to the committee\u2019s leaders. \u201cIf Senator Feinstein is satisfied with the apology then the affair is effectively over. If she contends there was a fundamental breach that cannot be corrected with a mere apology then some further action might be needed,\u201d Aftergood said.\n\nMcClatchy first reported the apology on Thursday.\n\nFeinstein, in her dramatic speech on the Senate floor in March, said the agency breached the firewall to obstruct the committee\u2019s investigation of the agency\u2019s torture of post-9/11 terrorism detainees, a years-long effort expected to be partially declassified in the coming days or weeks. That investigation was itself prompted by a different coverup: the destruction of videotapes of brutal interrogations by a senior official, Jose Rodriguez.\n\nDespite that, the committee has concluded that the torture was an ineffective means of gathering intelligence on al-Qaida \u2013 contradicting years of CIA assurances it was crucial \u2013 and that the agency lied to its overseers about its value.\n\nBrennan, a confidante of Barack Obama and a senior agency official when the \u201crendition, detention and interrogation\u201d program was established, immediately denied that his officials had spied on their overseers.\n\n\u201cAs far as the allegations of, you know, CIA hacking into, you know, Senate computers, nothing could be further from the truth. I mean we wouldn\u2019t do that. I mean, that\u2019s just beyond the \u2013 you know, the scope of reason in terms of what we would do,\u201d Brennan said on the day of Feinstein\u2019s accusation.\n\n\u201cIf I did something wrong,\u201d Brennan continued in March, \u201cI will go to the president, and I will explain to him exactly what I did, and what the findings were. And he is the one who can ask me to stay or to go.\u201d\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest credited Brennan with \u201cproactive leadership\u201d for appointing the Bayh-led board, an indication that Obama is not abandoning the man who, until March 2013, was his most senior counterterrorism aide.\n\nAccording to an unclassified summary of the CIA inspector general\u2019s findings released late on Thursday, two agency attorneys and three technical staff members \u201cimproperly accessed or caused access\u201d to the firewalled portions of the network that the committee staffers used. None was named. The three technicians \u201cdemonstrated a lack of candor about their activities during interviews.\u201d\n\nAmong other measures, the agency officials \u201cconducted a keyword search of all and and a review of some of the emails\u201d that committee staffers sent over the CIA-established network. Brennan was said not to know of the action, which occurred after he ordered an end to the surreptitious monitoring.\n\nThe inspector general additionally found that a CIA claim that the committee staff improperly accessed certain agency data on the network was the result of \u201cinaccurate information.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration has walked a delicate line over the torture report. Obama has insisted its prompt and thorough declassification \u2013 which has taken nearly four months \u2013 is a priority. Yet he appointed the CIA itself as the lead agency to determine what aspects of a report directly implicating CIA activities the public can see.\n\nEven before he was sworn in, Obama disappointed civil-liberties supporters by indicating his disinclination to prosecuting agency and ex-Bush administration officials who ordered and implemented the torture program. In 2012, a special prosecutor ended an inquiry without bringing charges. Only one man, a former CIA contractor named David Passaro, has gone to jail in connection to the CIA\u2019s post-9/11 torture.\n\nBrennan\u2019s apology also complicates a developing CIA pushback against a report that agency officials, current and former, consider shoddy. George Tenet, the former director whom Brennan served and who oversaw the brutal practices \u2013 where suspected terrorists were subjected to simulated drowning, had guns fired by their heads, were kept in undisclosed prisons for years and were sent to countries like Gadhafi\u2019s Libya and Assad\u2019s Syria for even more abusive treatment \u2013 is said to be developing a public strategy to attack the committee once the report is released.\n\nThe agency, consistent with a pattern that has held since 9/11, appears out of danger from criminal liability. Earlier this month, a Justice Department probe, also first reported by McClatchy, declined to pursue an investigation into Feinstein\u2019s now-vindicated charges.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Julian Borger In Washington", "body": "Donald Trump has hired an unwavering and radical advocate of war against both North Korea and Iran to oversee his administration\u2019s national security policy.\n\n\n\nJohn Bolton has made a career of deriding diplomacy as a sign of weakness, and has disparaged both the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, and even the current administration\u2019s use of sanctions as means of pressuring the North Korean regime to give up its nuclear arsenal.\n\nInstead, the soon-to-be national security adviser has repeatedly argued, nuclear disarmament in both cases is best achieved through regime change delivered by US military might.\n\n\u201cA close look shows he\u2019s genuinely one of the most extreme, irresponsible, and dangerous voices in the country,\u201d said Adam Mount, a senior fellow and nuclear weapons policy expert at the Federation of American Scientists.\n\nAmong Bolton\u2019s recently published opinions, is a piece a month ago in the Wall Street Journal entitled \u201cThe Legal Case for Striking North Korea First\u201d. While the 2015 agreement with Iran was being negotiated, he wrote a piece decrying the whole exercise in the New York Times. That was headlined: \u201cTo Stop Iran\u2019s Bomb, Bomb Iran.\u201d\n\nBolton has repeated these lines repeatedly on television, and Trump is widely reported to have chosen him because of his on-screen performances (despite initial reservations about his moustache, apparently). So the implication is that the president is well aware of his policy prescriptions.\n\nHe does not have to seek Senate confirmation for the White House post, which is just as well for Bolton. The last time the Senate was asked to confirm him, under the George W Bush administration, it refused on the grounds he was too extreme.\n\nTraditionally, the national security adviser convenes and chairs internal policy debates but Bolton\u2019s record suggests that a moderating role is not his style. At the state department, he doggedly pushed the bogus evidence of Saddam Hussein\u2019s weapons of mass destruction in the run-up to the Iraq invasion, and when the department\u2019s own intelligence bureau expressed scepticism, Bolton had its officials excluded from meetings.\n\nEverything we know about Bolton\u2019s past suggests he is coming to the White House to drive policy, not to broker it. That calls into question the continuing influence of James Mattis, the defence secretary, the last survivor from the group of moderating voices on foreign policy, the \u201cadults in the room\u201d. Rex Tillerson, gave his last goodbye speech as secretary of state on Thursday and will be formally gone by the end of the month, to be replaced by the far more hawkish and loyal CIA director, Mike Pompeo.\n\nBolton takes over from HR McMaster early next month, which means that Trump will go forward with a new and bellicose team into two of the most consequential decisions of his presidency.\n\nIf Trump does not sign the next sanctions waiver on Iran in mid-May, the US will be in violation of the 2015 agreement, quite possibly triggering a new crisis in the Gulf, and opening a rift in relations with European allies. McMaster and Tillerson had both urged him sign the waivers for that reason. Bolton, by contrast, has spent the past three years urging the destruction of the nuclear deal.\n\nBolton will also be at Trump\u2019s side when he heads for his planned summit with Kim Jong-un, and his presence will inevitably colour that critical encounter. Bolton, a former lawyer who like Trump avoided going to Vietnam, has advocated three different military options against North Korea: against nuclear facilities, bringing down a missile test, or an assassination of Kim Jong-un.\n\nBolton has acknowledged the likely devastating North Korean reprisals against South Korean civilians but has argued \u201cno foreign government, even a close ally, can veto an action to protect Americans from Kim Jong-un\u2019s nuclear weapons\u201d.\n\nThe conventional wisdom about Bolton was that he would not be a natural choice for Trump as he was hawkish on all fronts, including Russia. However, he has shown himself quite flexible when it comes to Trump\u2019s relations with the Kremlin, playing down the significance of the president\u2019s congratulation of Putin for his election victory, and he has suggested that the hacking of the Democratic party\u2019s emails (said by US intelligence to have been carried out by Russian operatives) could have been a false-flag operation by the Obama administration.\n\nFor a president looking to distract attention away from the investigation into his campaign and its Moscow links, by seeking confrontation on the world stage, Bolton may be the perfect fit.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Jessica Elgot Political Correspondent", "body": "MPs have summoned Mark Zuckerberg to appear before a select committee investigating fake news and accused his company of misleading them at a previous hearing.\n\n\n\nThe Facebook founder has been called to give evidence to the digital, culture, media and sport committee, following revelations over the use of its data by the election consultancy Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\n\nIn a letter to Zuckerberg, the committee\u2019s chair, Damian Collins, wrote that Facebook had been repeatedly asked about how companies acquired and held on to user data from its site, and whether data had been taken without users\u2019 consent.\n\n\u201cYour officials\u2019 answers have consistently understated this risk, and have been misleading to the committee,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cIt is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process ...

Theresa May \u2013 having identified the nerve agent used in the Salisbury attack as novichok, developed in Russia \u2013 told the Commons on Wednesday that Russia had offered no explanation as to why it had \u201can undeclared chemical weapons programme in contravention of international law\u201d.

It details an incident when poison hidden in a phone receiver killed a Russian banker and his secretary in 1995. The poison came from an employee at the state chemical facility who sold it through intermediaries - in an ampule placed in a presentation case - to help reduce his debts.\n\nThe UK government case rests not just on its argument that novichok was developed in Russia, but what it says is past form, a record of Russian state-sponsored assassination of former spies.\n\n\n\nMurray, in a phone interview, is undeterred, determined to challenge the government line, in spite of having been subjected to a level of abuse on social media he had not experienced before.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence it was Russia. I am not ruling out that it could be Russia, though I don\u2019t see the motive. I want to see where the evidence lies,\u201d Murray said. \u201cAnyone who expresses scepticism is seen as an enemy of the state.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Owen Jones", "body": "\u201cIt\u2019s like Spain in 1936.\u201d Those are the words of Alexander Norton, a charismatic 31-year-old railway worker from east London, as Turkish forces besiege the Kurdish city of Afrin. Like Britain\u2019s courageous International Brigades eight decades earlier, Norton risked his life to fight Isis alongside Kurdish freedom fighters in Kurdish Syria. As you read this, a secular democracy which celebrates women\u2019s rights is under attack, including by Turkish-aligned troops who have sung al-Qaida songs and threatened to cut off the heads of their \u201catheist\u201d victims. If you\u2019re wondering why Kurds and their supporters occupied King\u2019s Cross and Manchester Piccadilly stations last weekend: here\u2019s why. The Conservative government is arming to the teeth a nation ruled by an authoritarian despot, whose regime is linked to extreme jihadist groups, and which is now attempting to liquidate one of the only islands of democracy in a sea of Middle Eastern despotism: and yet virtually no one is speaking out about it.\n\nHundreds of thousands of civilians \u2013 many of whom are refugees who have fled the barbarity of Syria\u2019s civil war \u2013 currently live under siege. Ever since Turkey launched a military offensive with the Orwellian codename Operation Olive Branch, around 230 civilians have died. But this isn\u2019t just about the threat to civilian life. 26-year-old Elif Sarican \u2013 an activist with the Kurdish Women\u2019s Movement \u2013 struggles to speak to me: her voice is hoarse through protesting. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand the attack of the Turkish army, with its allied jihadist forces, is not just against the Kurdish people,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThese are two systems at war.\u201d\n\nConsider the nature of the two sides in this onslaught. The self-described Democratic Federation of North Syria, known as Rojava, is a remarkable experiment: of direct democracy and a gender revolution. \u201cEssentially, in the birthplace of patriarchy, women are liberating themselves,\u201d Sarican tells me. Most striking are the women soldiers who have fearlessly fought Isis fighters. \u201cOne of the first things I noticed was that women soldiers were incredibly equal and assertive,\u201d says Norton, the first Briton to sign up because of their socialist convictions. \u201cThey\u2019re not afraid to come up to you and say \u2018take your gun off\u2019, or argue with you. They\u2019re not physically nervous around men which you immediately notice: different, not just in their society, but in our own.\u201d\n\nThere are democratic assemblies ranging from the neighbourhood level to cantons: quotas are enforced to ensure representation for women, as well as for ethnic minorities. Democratic involvement is deemed mandatory. One of Norton\u2019s jobs in the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) was to go from house to house to ask citizens to attend commune meetings and offer lifts. Women-only meetings drew up a new social contract for Rojava: banning marriage under a certain age, proscribing polygamy, making domestic violence a specific offence. When any woman says their husbands forbid them from attending meetings, a group of women will instead descend on their home, leaving him with little choice. \u201cThis a huge social revolution,\u201d says Paula Lamont, the Kurdish Solidarity Campaign\u2019s co-chair. \u201cAttitudes to gay rights and women\u2019s rights have been totally changed in a matter of years.\u201d If a town of 50,000 had even one synagogue attended by just 15 Jews, Jewish representation is guaranteed on the assemblies. Every poster is translated, almost obsessively, into every language of every minority, however few belong to it. \u201cI saw a real workers\u2019 revolution,\u201d Norton tells me: one where socialism, feminism and even environmentalism were synthesised.\n\nConsider our noble friend and ally Turkey, on the other hand. Turkey\u2019s regime locks up more journalists than any other government on earth. Since an abortive coup, tens of thousands of Turks have been detained or sacked on political grounds. It is a regime with a history of sordid links with jihadist extremists. It once backed the al-Nusra Front, which is al-Qaida by another name; and backs Ahrar al-Sham, an extreme jihadist group. Isis was allowed to expand because, for many years, Turkey allowed its murderous zealots to cross the porous border into Syria. There is evidence of oil smuggled by Isis with Turkish buyers as their main clients, and relationships between Turkish officials and Isis officers. Isis commanders have been treated in Turkey\u2019s hospitals.\n\nThe evidence is even more damning than that. One former Isis soldier has told the journalist Patrick Cockburn that \u201cmost of those who are fighting in Afrin against the YPG are Isis, though Turkey has trained them to change their assault tactics.\u201d In any case, the relationship between Turkey and fanatical extremists is undeniable. Yes, there have been repeated terrorist attacks against Turkey by a group of fanatics the regime is partly responsible for fuelling: but note they have repeatedly targeted Kurds, like the town of Suruc \u2013 just across the Turkish border \u2013 where 33 Kurdish socialists were killed in July 2015; or when 109 died in a bomb attack on a pro-Kurdish peace rally in Ankara in October 2015.\n\nWhat is our own government\u2019s response? On her second major foreign visit after becoming prime minister, Theresa May signed a deal worth \u00a3100m to develop Turkish fighter jets. This is utterly scandalous. Given the Labour leadership is routinely called a threat to both national security and democratic values, why is it permissible for the Tories to arm to the teeth a jihadist-linked foreign government intent on snuffing out a beleaguered democracy?\n\nThere is a challenge to the left, too. We rightly condemn the injustice inflicted on the Palestinian people as they language under the occupation of a western-backed state. Where is the equal outrage over the assault against democratic socialist Rojave? Our own government \u2013 complicit in this unforgivable bloodshed \u2013 must be pressured to cease arms sales to Turkey and to exert diplomatic pressure. The same goes for Saudi Arabia: after all, it is that repulsive regime which exports Wahhabi and Salafist extremism to the Middle East and beyond. Rojave, too, must be officially recognised, and have a seat at the table in any resolution of Syria\u2019s protracted horror.\n\nAlexander Norton is right. This is our Spain. Extremist authoritarians who despise democracy, women and freedom are at war with what should be an international beacon, a society which offers an example far beyond the despot-afflicted Middle East. Turkey knows that Rojava\u2019s success will inspire not just its own Kurdish population to assert its rights: it sees a system which threatens its own degenerate authoritarian order. British Kurds are occupying train stations and roads because no-one will listen to them about one of the gravest injustices on earth.

In Cambridgeshire, for example, the average \u201cprompt\u201d response time was 15 hours. This could include cases of serious assault, including sexual violence, inspectors said.\n\nThe inspectorate put the delays down to a lack of police officers available to attend the emergencies, ruling out a problem with the call handlers.\n\nLabour said the findings showed that cuts to police budgets had left the service at breaking point, while the minister for policing pointed out inspectors found most forces to be effective at keeping people safe.\n\nZo\u00eb Billingham, Her Majesty\u2019s Inspector of Constabulary, who led the inspection, said she had \u201cmajor concerns that policing is under significant stress\u201d.\n\nShe said: \u201cOn occasions, that stress stretches some forces to such an extent that they risk being unable to keep people safe in some very important areas of policing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout a quarter of forces are all too often overwhelmed by the demand they face, resulting in worrying backlogs of emergency jobs, with officers not attending incidents promptly, including those involving vulnerable people.\u201d\n\nPolice budgets have fallen by around a fifth since 2010 and HMICFRS recently said forces will have \u00a3700m less a year to fight crime in the coming years, as well as fewer officers.\n\nEarlier this week, Theresa May was officially rebuked by the UK Statistics Authority for misleading MPs and the public over false claims that the government was providing an extra \u00a3450m in funding to local police forces in 2018/19.\n\nLouise Haigh, the shadow policing and crime minister, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had all the Tory spin on police funding, but this week we are finally getting to the truth.\n\n\u201cFirst the stats watchdog raps the prime minister for misleading claims and now the independent inspector is sounding the alarm \u2013 warning that some forces are so stretched that the lives of vulnerable people are being put at risk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time the Tories owned up to the public because their cuts have left our police at breaking point and our communities at risk.\u201d\n\nAs well as struggling to respond to emergency calls, HMICFRS found police officers were not seizing opportunities to look for evidence in the initial stages of the investigation.\n\n\n\nIn too many cases, so-called \u201cgolden hour\u201d responsibilities were not being carried out, the watchdog said. House-to-house enquires, identifying witnesses and use of body-worn cameras were being overlooked.\n\nIn addition, a review of 2,700 crime case files revealed more than 50% of opportunities to identify an offender were missed and on a quarter of occasions house-to-house enquiries in search of witnesses were not made.\n\nThe watchdog also found police forces with high workloads and \u201cpoor supervision\u201d are yet to risk assess 3,300 registered sex offenders, an 18% increase on last year.\n\nAs of July last year, there were 60,061 \u201cwanted records\u201d on the police national computer \u2013 including 374 relating to homicide and 1,135 to rape, the report said.\n\nAnd it highlighted the ongoing \u201cnational crisis\u201d in the shortage of detectives. There is currently a shortfall of 5,000 investigators across England and Wales, meaning one in five detective desks are empty, the report said.\n\nThe report added: \u201cHMICFRS is concerned by this finding, because it shows that the system is under severe strain and in some forces the cracks are showing.\u201d\n\nOverall one force was rated \u201coutstanding\u201d, 30 were \u201cgood\u201d and 12 judged to \u201crequire improvement\u201d.\n\nNick Hurd, the minister for policing and the fire service, said: \u201cThe government recognises that crime is changing and demand increasing, which is why we have provided a strong and comprehensive settlement that will increase funding by up to \u00a3450m across the police system for 2018/19, including \u00a3270m drawn from increased precept contributions.\n\n\u201cThe government has given police new powers to protect vulnerable people, including domestic violence protection orders and new offences under the Modern Slavery Act, and progress has been made in this area.

Ukip is dead. Farage has been reduced to being a minor radio personality in Britain and a down-the-bill warm-up act in Trump country. As for the supposedly serious Brexiters, the Observer\u2019s revelations will surely discredit the Vote Leave crew, assuming they have any credit left to diss, that is.\n\nLook at them. They can\u2019t even organise a mindless publicity stunt. They were to throw fish in the Thames \u2013 haddock, if you must know \u2013 to protest about EU fishing quotas remaining until 2021. Alas, the trawler could not moor. Jacob Rees-Mogg was left stranded on the\u00a0bank, not by Brussels bureaucrats but good old British red, white and blue tape, which mandates that you must have a Transport for London permit to pull in at Westminster pier.\n\nAs futile was the Tory right\u2019s follow-up threat to crash the economy by scuppering the transition deal if Britain does not get control of its territorial waters in 2019. Because of the Brexit referendum, and for the first time in British history, we have a prime minister, chancellor of the exchequer, home secretary, half of the government benches and nearly all the opposition benches following a policy they believe is against the national interest. They will not make further concessions to the Tory right that has forced them to betray their conscience and country.\n\nAs I said, it\u2019s easy to laugh. A little too easy. Nigel Farage remains the most significant politician since Margaret Thatcher. If it wasn\u2019t for him, we would still be in the EU. As for Ukip and the Tory right, they only seem insignificant because they have forced the PM to give them virtually everything they want. Their sidelining may turn out to be a clever strategic move. They will be able to cry \u201cstab in the back\u201d and \u201cBrexit betrayed\u201d because Theresa May will be responsible for the decline they brought to Britain. If only, the right will say, the perfidious establishment had not compromised we would have had a Brexit filled with hope and glory.\n\nMatthew Goodwin and Rob Ford, who pioneered the research into the new right, tell me they are not writing its obituary yet. Trump and Orb\u00e1n control the US and Hungary. So weak are liberal forces, it is counted a victory when the National Front wins only 33.9% of the vote in the French presidential election. There\u2019s no reason to believe in British exceptionalism. Given a charismatic leader either inside or outside the Tory party, the right will clamber out of its shallow grave to blame everyone else for the consequences of its dogmatism.\n\nFor even the most blinkered must be realising that Brexit is looking absurd. Until 2021 there will still be free movement with the EU, Britain will have to accept the judgments of the European court and implement EU laws, the only difference being we will have no say in the laws\u2019 content. Even after the transition period is over, exporters will still meet EU standards because they will want to trade with the continent, and farmers and the protesting fishermen will have to cut a deal if they want to sell their produce.\u00a0As for immigration, business and the public sector will tell the government that every enterprise from care homes to restaurant chains will collapse if it closes the borders.\n\nI don\u2019t want to lay the flattery on with a trowel but Jacob Rees-Mogg isn\u2019t always the drivel-spouting dullard he appears. When he says Britain risks becoming a \u201cvassal state\u201d of the EU after 2019 he\u2019s right, but he cannot draw the obvious conclusion that we shouldn\u2019t leave. Nor can millions of others because of a failure by progressive opinion to argue respectfully with them.\n\nFor some, the failure is an act of policy. A faction among Labour MPs and commentators announces they are respecting the voters\u2019 wishes, even though they realise leaving the single market will harm the poorest parts of Britain. (They then stand back as if expecting a round of applause for their bravery.) The rightwing press makes too much of them, but there are undoubtedly also liberals who think supporters of Brexit are just stupid racists, and there is no point arguing with them.\n\nIn any political battle, you should always ask how far you can compromise without selling your soul. The right cannot be stopped now or in future unless a portion of its supporters are offered reasons to change their minds. Few are forthcoming from the liberal-left. The dominant leftish explanation for working-class support for leave is it was a protest by the people left behind by Thatcherism. As leftists hated Thatcher, this is the worst type of self-indulgent reasoning: the argument that proves you have been right all along.\n\nThe liberal-left does not try to understand harder reasons behind Brexit and grapple with working-class patriotism, fears about immigration and political correctness, and the yearning for strong government and national security. Perhaps progressives can never assuage these passions without becoming reactionaries themselves, but they could try. If not, there should at least be a campaign to explain to leave voters how they have been deceived.\n\nHere we run into an under-discussed problem. Without the support of the official opposition, efforts to hold the right to account will be puny. That Jeremy Corbyn and the British far left are anti-EU has been of the utmost importance. They have not pounded away at the lies the left-behind were fed, and tried to provoke a class that is hugely suspicious of politicians to turn on Farage and Johnson for taking them for fools.

They have been approaching EU states on that bilaterally and today May will tell EU leaders more.\u201d\n\nWhitehall officials have said that Russia \u201chas shown itself to be a strategic enemy, not a strategic partner\u201d, pointing to a pattern of behaviour including cyber-attacks on countries including Germany, the US and Denmark and aggression in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nRussia\u2019s ambassador to the UK described Boris Johnson\u2019s comparison of this summer\u2019s World Cup to the Nazi Olympics as \u201cunacceptable and totally irresponsible\u201d.\n\nAt a press conference in London on Thursday,\n\nAlexander Yakovenko complained that Britain had refused to co-operate with Moscow over the investigation into the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. \u201cWe have seen no evidence,\u201d he said.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Guardian Nigeria", "body": "The development now appears like a similar move made earlier under the administration of Goodluck Jonathan in 2013, in which several infrastructure deals were signed, but later reduced to bilateral trade rather than finance and capital flows.\n\nAccording to reports, after a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing two years ago, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (ICBC), the world\u2019s biggest lender, and Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank signed a deal on yuan transactions.\n\n\u201cIt means that the renminbi (yuan) is free to flow among different banks in Nigeria, and the renminbi has been included in the foreign exchange reserves of Nigeria,\u201d the Director-General of the African Affairs Department of China\u2019s foreign ministry, Lin Songtian, said.\n\nBut the planned engagement was trailed by a mix of optimism, pessimism and caution from stakeholders and experts, citing previous experiences of similar efforts.\n\nForemost industrialist, Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa, in a monitored television programme, had said that the optimism greeting the Nigeria-China deals might pale into insignificance, if the negotiators failed on the contents and terms of the agreement, especially with an antecedent of similar deals in other African countries that have not been totally progressive.\n\nFor analysts at Afrinvest, the strong participation of private investors in the FDI and loan agreements sealed, sequel to the move, would improve the implementation rate relative to past bi-lateral investment engagements and could potentially boost capital importation from China and domestic infrastructure investment.\n\n\u201cWe are currently caught in-between the two positions taken by the CBN Governor and Minster of Foreign Affairs.\n\nWhile awaiting official clarifications, we think the \u2018currency deal\u2019 could either be a conventional swap, in which the CBN and China would exchange a stock of their currencies at a predetermined exchange rate to be reversed at maturity of the swap line or a move by China to boost yuan-liquidity in Nigerian banks as a trade and investment currency in exchange for future assets transfer (probably oil) to China to liquidate the swap line,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nStatistics showed that between 2013 and February 2016, Nigeria received $213.4 million worth of capital inflows from Mainland China, which are about 0.4 per cent of the $52.4 billion total capital importation into Nigeria within the period, ranking as the 18th largest source of foreign capital inflows into Nigeria.\n\nBut including the autonomous region of Hong Kong, total capital flows from People\u2019s Republic of China amounted to $484.2 million within the period, still less than one per cent of total capital importation into Nigeria.\n\nAs at the end of 2017, the value of merchandise trade between Nigeria and China was put at $2.7 billion, making Nigeria the third largest African partner with China. But the figure was lopsided in favour of China.\n\nRenowned economist and Chief Executive Officer of Financial Derivatives Limited, Bismarck Rewane, described the initial efforts as a waste of time and an aspiration that was never going to materialise.\n\nHe said there were too many unknown swap deals, with several of such deals in other countries not being progressive and models to follow.\n\n\u201cNigeria wouldn\u2019t have been better for it. If you want bilateral or trade relations, it is better to do it with your money not swap. Naira is not a convertible currency in the international market, but our oil earnings are in dollars.\n\nSo, we are still in the same place, that is, sell your crude oil in dollars and buy from China in dollars. Unless we sell crude oil to them and collect their yuan, swap is not ideal,\u201d he said.\n\nA top bank chief, who would not want his name in print said the mention of \u201cswap\u201d in the discussion was the biggest diversion that would have made any deal cumbersome and a rip-off on the country, because China knows how to get a better bargain.\n\n\u201cBut I thought there would have been also talks about reducing the naira-dollar-yuan intricacies in trade between the country and Nigeria. In fact, what the United Kingdom just offered Nigeria recently is what I thought the leadership would have pressed for.\n\n\u201cIn all, the trip and the proposal were more like showing that we said something instead of not saying anything because I can\u2019t see any positive since then except borrowing from them. The worst was the un-clarity, secrecy and withholding of information that dogged the plan until its failure,\u201d the source said.\n\nA fiscal governance campaigner, Eze Onyekpere, said such heightened expectations by government through media was a clear case of \u201cgovernance by propaganda\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, the way it was presented at the beginning was more of a done or near deal, with promises of improved returns for the economy.\n\n\u201cThe two scenarios, which are tantamount to failure is either they lied to us, when there was no agreement or they failed to follow through the deal. But they were faster in rushing to the media and now they have failed. It\u2019s such a disappointment,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Managing Director of Cowry Asset Management Limited, Johnson Chukwu, said he was doubtful from the beginning of the possibility of such a deal that its terms were not defined- particularly the exchange rate and timeline.\n\nAccording to him, it is one of the failed projects because there is no sign now that government has it on its agenda, as everything has remained under uncertainty and secrecy.\n\n\u201cIt is like government took its eyes off it.

How on earth can a little law tackle such a big problem?\n\nHe offered up some token concessions that would do not very much at all to stop the massacres: raising the age you could buy an assault weapon, but not banning them. Better background checks, but not universal ones. Stopping the sale of bump stocks, which played no part in the bloodshed at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school.\n\nWith ample charm and empathy, he almost got away with it. Until he met a 17-year-old student who was just as talented as him: Cameron Kasky, who survived the shooting by huddling with his brother in a classroom.\n\nKasky walked up to Rubio and shook his hand, along with the hands of the other politicians on stage: Florida senator Bill Nelson and his local congressman, Ted Deutch, both Democrats. He asked his friend to stand up and be acknowledged for signing up to serve in the military. And he asked the crowd not to boo Republicans and cheer Democrats.

Often, the response \u2013 only semi-joking \u2013 is, \u201cYou mean other countries are worse?\u201d\n\nBut inquiring after the sauce\u2019s recipe of, among others, an economist, a philosopher, a sociologist and an ex-president, intriguing ingredients emerge.\n\nTo begin with, the geography \u2013 and its consequence, the climate. \u201cWe live,\u201d Tarja Halonen, Finland\u2019s president from 2000 to 2012, says carefully, \u201cin a cold, harsh and remote place. Every person has to work hard for themselves. But that is not always enough. You have to help your neighbours.\u201d\n\nBruce Oreck, who served as Barack Obama\u2019s ambassador to Helsinki (he liked it so much he stayed), says this has been \u201ca profound, long-term influence. It\u2019s made Finns self-reliant, private, but also dependent on a highly cooperative society, where rules matter. It\u2019s cultural, but it\u2019s become part of the chemistry.\u201d\n\nOf all the Finnish words that are hard to translate into English, the one Finns cite most is sisu: a kind of dogged, courageous persistence regardless of consequence. It is what, in 1939-40, allowed an army of 350,000 men to twice fight off Soviet forces three times their number, and inflict losses five times heavier than those they sustained.\n\nBut there is another that is, perhaps, more revealing, says Sirpa K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen, an award-winning historical novelist. Talkoo means \u201cworking together, collectively, for a specific good\u201d, she says. \u201cGetting the harvest in, stocking wood, raising money. It\u2019s about cooperating. Everyone together, equally.\u201d\n\nCooperation, but also relative equality, are recurring themes. Ruled for almost 600 years by Sweden and a further century by Russia, Finland was \u201cgenerally and democratically poor\u201d, says K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen. \u201cThere were no serfs, but no wildly wealthy aristocrats either. Society was not hierarchical.\u201d\n\nSince long before independence in 1917, says Riitta Jallinoja, a sociologist, \u201cgaps between the social classes in Finland have been smaller than usual. Even the industrial revolution here was modest: no Rothschilds, no Fords, not even a dynasty like Sweden\u2019s Wallenbergs.\u201d\n\nEven in today\u2019s clean, functional, visibly prosperous Helsinki, that still sort of holds. \u201cYou can be walking down the street next to the richest guy in town, and you really wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d says Oreck. In Finland, insists Halonen, \u201cYou don\u2019t look up at people, and you don\u2019t look down. You look level.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s most successful current firm, games studio Supercell, creator of Clash of Clans, paid over \u20ac800m in tax, producing seven of Finland\u2019s top 10 income tax payers in 2016. Along with the rest of the country\u2019s highest 10,000 or so highest earners, the amount they pay is published in an annual list, on \u201cnational envy day\u201d. Finland is big on civic duty, but also on transparency.\n\nThe success of the country\u2019s free national education system, established before independence in 1866 and regularly ranked among the world\u2019s best, also has its roots in a more egalitarian society, says Jallinoja: \u201cEducation was the key to advancement.\u201d\n\nNot only that, says the philosopher and professor emeritus Ilkka Niiniluoto, but the whole country is actually \u201ca social construction created by university professors.\u201d The academics who led the country\u2019s nationalist movement \u201ccreated Finland as a nation: its language, history, literature, music, symbols, folklore. The nationalist leader was a philosophy professor.\u201d\n\nSince independence, nearly 30% of Finland\u2019s heads of state and government have been university professors, including half its early prime ministers. \u201cThey shaped the country as we know it,\u201d says Jallinoja. \u201cBut vitally, they also created confidence in social mobility, and real belief in education. That history comes with us.\u201d\n\nIf, however, Finland has been rated the world\u2019s most literate country, it may also have something to do with a 19th-century decree that a couple could not marry in the Lutheran church before both passed a reading test. \u201cQuite an incentive,\u201d observes Halonen, \u201cto learn to read.\u201d\n\nGender equality, similarly, was baked in. In 1906, Finnish women became, if not quite the first to win the vote, the first to run for electoral office. Nearly 10% of MPs in Finland\u2019s first parliament were women (the figure is now 42%); as early as 1930, up to 30% of university students were women. \u201cWomen in Finland took their rights seriously, and men accepted it,\u201d says Halonen.\n\nOther ingredients have since added to the sauce. Finland benefited enormously from wise wartime and postwar leaders, insists Holmstr\u00f6m: \u201cThey thought about the good of the country; took big, sensible decisions. And the consensus backed them, because everyone knew we were fighting for our existence.\u201d\n\nResponsible choices were made, invariably by continuity-conscious coalition governments, on big industrial and infrastructure investments, that have paid dividends many times over. More recently, today\u2019s high-tech, startup-friendly Finland was born of record investment in research and development in the 1990s, nearing 4% of GDP.\n\nSteady growth \u2013 through war, the collapse of the Soviet Union and a deep recession in the 1990s, Finland\u2019s economy has expanded over the past century at a rate equalled only by Japan\u2019s \u2013 has bolstered trust in the nation\u2019s institutions. \u201cPeople criticise the government constantly, and often for very good reason,\u201d says K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen. \u201cBut fundamentally, they do trust it.\u201d\n\nAs they do, on the whole, their welfare state \u2013 on which Finland spends 31% of its GDP, the second highest proportion in the OECD. (\u201cIf you\u2019re going to have a welfare state,\u201d says Halonen, \u201cthe only real way to it is so well that there\u2019s no point having a private alternative.\u201d)\n\nBut Finns also trust each other more than most, says Andr\u00e9 Chaker, a Canadian-born lawyer and public speaker who has lived in the country for 25 years. Corruption and organised crime are all but nonexistent. \u201cThat feeds into the business environment,\u201d he says. \u201cThings get done here faster, more reliably.\u201d\n\nAnd it is trust that breeds confidence, and a willingness to innovate: the World Economic Forum ranks Finland the most innovative country, per capita, in the world. For years dominated by monolithic mining and forestry firms, then by the once-mighty Nokia, Finland today is close behind Silicon Valley in the number of startups per head.\n\nThe magic sauce, then, seems based mainly on basic virtues: self-confidence, cooperation, equality, respect for education, trust. At bottom and in practice, says Anu Partanen, a Finnish journalist who now lives in New York, it boils down to a different quality of relationship. She calls it \u2013 since it is shared to a greater or lesser extent by Sweden, Norway and Denmark \u2013 the Nordic theory of love.\n\n\u201cIn the family, it\u2019s realising that relationships can only really flourish between individuals \u2013 parents, children, spouses \u2013 who are equal and independent,\u201d Partanen says. \u201cIn a society, it means policy choices aimed at ensuring the greatest possible degree of independence, freedom and opportunity for everyone.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to the world\u2019s biggest problems.

Ice also detained a second worker, Rodrigo N\u00fa\u00f1ez.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy life just changed in only five or 10 minutes. I felt like I lost everything,\u201d the father of three told the Guardian.\n\nTwo weeks later when his wife came to visit him in an immigration detention center, much to his amazement, he learned that his union, the Painters Union Local 82, was hiring a lawyer to represent him.\n\n\n\n\u201cI just thought that I was a member of the union for work and so I could get insurance for my kids. I never thought that my union would help me in a case like this. It was amazing,\u201d said Mej\u00eda Murgu\u00eda. \n\n\n\nUnder the banner #FreeHugo, his union went all out on his behalf, holding rallies around the country to stop his deportation.\n\n\n\nThe pressure was intense. \u201cA couple times I tried to quit. It was just so hard to stay far from my family. It was hard when they came to visit me because of the glass when I saw them crying and I couldn\u2019t touch them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they gave me letters and this support, that got me excited and I didn\u2019t feel so alone about my case.\u201d\n\n\n\nFinally, on 22 November, after 204 days in detention, he was released as a result of his union\u2019s activism in public and in court, winning a stay on political asylum grounds.\n\n\n\nRodrigo N\u00fa\u00f1ez was less fortunate and was deported back to Mexico.\n\nTheir different fates highlight a split in the union movement and its attitude to undocumented workers who are increasingly running into difficulties under the Trump administration.\n\nN\u00fa\u00f1ez\u2019s union, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, did not defend him. While the Painters Union has chosen to embrace their increasingly immigrant workforce over the last few decades, the UBC has a much more strained relationship with immigrants.\n\nIn March 2017, Bill Bing, a representative for the Northeast Regional Carpenters Council representative, even admitted in the Buffalo News that the union routinely called Ice to report undocumented workers on construction sites in upstate New York.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are very good local union and nonunion contractors who suffer the fallout from dirty business,\u201d Bing told the Buffalo News.\n\n\n\nThe leadership of North America\u2019s Building Trades Unions has traditionally been one of the whitest sectors of the labor movement. Civil rights groups have repeatedly sued construction unions to admit African Americans, and for decades, unions like the Carpenters would call immigration authorities to deport undocumented workers.\n\n\n\nHowever, over the last two decades as construction unions sought to organize larger numbers of undocumented workers, the attitude of labor has changed. Now, in the era of Trump, many labor leaders see an opportunity to accelerate those changes.\n\n\n\n\u201cHas the Trump era accelerated our efforts? Absolutely,\u201d said the Painters Union president, Ken Rigmaiden. \u201cThere are too many reasons to mention but one, in particular, is forcing 11 million immigrants back into the dark side of the construction economy, where wage theft and intimidation thrive.\u201d\n\n\n\nSince being elected in 2013 as the union\u2019s first African American president, Rigmaiden has led efforts to get construction unions to embrace immigrant labor.\n\nIn July 2017, Rigmaiden hired 30-year-old Neidi Dominguez, who immigrated to the US from Mexico when she was nine and lived here undocumented until she was 25, as the Painters Union\u2019s national strategic campaign coordinator. \n\n\n\nAs the first Latina woman to head a major department at the Painters Union, Dominguez has led efforts not only to make her union more vocal and active on immigration, but to push other unions to be more proactive. Labor leaders like Dominguez say that since the majority of new members in the construction workforce are Latinos, building trades unions must do more to embrace immigrant workers if they are going to survive.\n\n\u201cIn the building trades for too long, it\u2019s been almost nothing but a bunch of white guys. It\u2019s changing but not quick enough,\u201d said Dominguez.\n\nUnder Dominguez\u2019s leadership, the union helped to launch the Working Families United coalition, that has helped lead labor\u2019s effort to protect workers facing threats of deportation while pushing unions to be more inclusive of immigrants.\n\nBecause of Trump administration policy shifts regarding undocumented workers, the Painters Union is one of many that has become a sanctuary union and developed programs to defend their membership against the threat of deportation.\n\n\n\nNot only have the unions become more engaged in assisting their immigrant members facing deportation within their union, but externally their politics have also begun to shift.\n\n\n\nDuring the 2013 immigration debates, the AFL-CIO officially embraced the use of E-Verify system to check documentation of workers on construction. Some unions still embrace E-Verify, but many labor leaders have noticed a shift.\n\n\n\nOne factor that has helped promote the leftward shift of the building trades has been the emergence of Latino labor leaders within their unions. One of the most prominent of those is Randy Bryce, a half Mexican, half Polish ironworker from Racine, Wisconsin, known as the \u201cIron Stache\u201d for his distinctive facial hair, who has become a social media hit with his grassroots campaign against the House speaker, Paul Ryan.\n\n\n\nDespite living in a district in south-eastern Wisconsin that is only 5% Latino, Bryce has made immigration reform a central issue of his campaign; getting arrested recently during a protest against Ryan\u2019s refusal to pass the Dream Act to protect undocumented children raised in the US.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople are getting the message,\u201d said Bryce. \u201cI tell people everybody is trying to gain access to the American dream. It\u2019s getting harder and harder to find, but it\u2019s not other people risking their lives trying to come over here to find it. It\u2019s not their fault, it\u2019s the boss trying to keep their foot on all of our necks.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Michael Mcgowan", "body": "One of the architects of Australia\u2019s strict gun control laws says he is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the emergence of what he described as a US-inspired firearms lobby.\n\nTim Fischer, the former deputy prime minister and leader of the National party who alongside John Howard helped to pass landmark reforms after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, says he believes a \u201cwave\u201d of firearm lobbying influenced by the US National Rifle Association is putting renewed pressure on Australian gun laws.\n\nFischer told the Guardian he believed \u201cNRA-inspired\u201d lobbying coupled with the increased influence of rightwing parties such as One Nation in Canberra and the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party in New South Wales had influenced a \u201cpushback\u201d against Australia\u2019s gun laws, and called on politicians to stand up to pressure. \n\n\n\n\u201cWaves of NRA-originated ideology do descend on Australia and have done since 1996,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we are seeing another wave of the NRA\u2019s indirect influence descending on Australia at the federal and state levels [and] that\u2019s deeply concerning to me.\u201d\n\nFischer\u2019s warning comes in the context of an increasingly well-funded and organised gun lobby with ties to weapons importers and manufacturers.\n\nLast week the Guardian revealed that the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, was considering establishing a committee to allow gun importers to review proposed changes to firearm regulations for \u201cappropriateness and intent\u201d.\n\nThe proposal to establish the committee was put to Dutton during a private meeting with representatives from gun importer Nioa and the Shooting Industry Foundation of Australia (Sifa).\n\nA lobbying outfit whose directors include some of Australia\u2019s largest gun dealers, Sifa has only five members and represents a departure from the membership-driven model of most shooting groups in Australia. But what it lacks in numbers it makes up for in funding and influence.\n\nFinancial disclosures published with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission show that Sifa\u2019s five members pumped $768,000 into the group in the 2016-17 financial year.\n\nAmong the members is Robert Nioa, the managing director of the largest small arms importer in Australia.\n\nAside from being a major donor to his father-in-law, the independent federal MP Bob Katter, Nioa\u2019s company receives millions of dollars in defence contracts from the Australian government and Nioa himself is well connected politically. \n\n\n\nIn December the defence industry minister, Christopher Pyne, attended the opening of his new office in Canberra, according to the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia.\n\nThe federal lobbying register also lists Sifa as a client of Barton Deakin, a Liberal party-aligned lobbyist group. Barton Deakin\u2019s federal director is Grahame Morris, a former chief of staff to Howard.\n\nWhen contacted by the Guardian on Friday, Morris said he had never heard of Sifa but after checking said a former consultant of Barton Deakin had done \u201csome work\u201d for the group.

This is, partly, why 12 years after the start of the Iraq war, half of Republicans still believed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction (it didn\u2019t) and two years ago 59% of Trump supporters still thought Barack Obama was not born in America (he was).

There is also a wish to avoid responsibility for failing to connect politically in the decades since the financial crisis with a message that resonated, and to seek instead a legal remedy or technical reprieve by impeaching the president or annulling the referendum.\n\nThere is no contradiction between accepting that the Russians, Facebook, ignorance, Cambridge Analytica or stupidity played a role and understanding that a far larger drama, which has been under way for far longer, makes sense of the role they were able to play. If Trump is removed by impeachment, so be it. But that will be an inadequate salve for the long-running sores that made him possible.\n\nCambridge Analytica didn\u2019t invent the racism, misogyny and xenophobia that have corroded American political culture and made Trump possible. These social pathologies were eating away at our democracies long before social media was invented. Their roots are deeper, their reach farther and their influence greater than any algorithm could conjure.\n\nThe Russians did not tell Hillary Clinton to send surrogates to Arizona shortly before the election, when they would have been far more helpful in Michigan or Wisconsin. They didn\u2019t tell her to give a speech at Goldman Sachs for $225,000 in the wake of a huge bank bailout or call half Trump\u2019s supporters a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d. Facebook hadn\u2019t been invented when she was for the Iraq war before she was against it, or when she was against gay marriage before she was for it.\n\nSocial media platforms, nefarious bots and dodgy data companies can amplify views that are already out there and distort perspectives that already exist \u2013 but they cannot invent them. In short they can manipulate the supply of ideas, but they cannot create the demand for those ideas from thin air.\n\nTrump\u2019s victory and Brexit came in a time of growing economic inequality, wage stagnation, mass migration, rising xenophobia and racial tension. Bill Clinton was right \u2013 there was a mood out there. That mood emerged from material conditions that mainstream parties had made possible over the past few decades, through, among other things, illegal war, deregulation, trade liberalisation and vile rhetoric on immigration. And on both sides of the Atlantic liberals failed to either take responsibility for this or adequately respond to its consequences. Now they are paying the price.\n\nNone of this excuses the actions of those who have sought to mislead us nor denies the power of the memes, messages and misinformation that they have produced. With some help, what begins life as received wisdom can graduate to common knowledge and mature into a full-blown script that people recite without knowing where it came from or what, precisely, it means. \u201cWe just put information [like \u2018crooked Hillary\u2019] into the bloodstream of the internet and watch it grow,\u201d claimed Cambridge Analytica\u2019s CEO, Alexander Nix, who has since been suspended. \u201cGive it a little push every now and again over time to watch it take shape \u2026 So this stuff infiltrates the online community with no branding, so it\u2019s unattributable, untrackable.\u201d\n\nWe know these things made a difference. Given the narrow margins of defeat in both the Brexit referendum and the 2016 presidential election, it is an open question whether they made the difference that tipped us over the edge. That matters.\n\nBut either way, the question remains: what were we doing so close to the edge? And how do we get out of the pit we are now in? We do not yet have the answer to the second question. But we can be fairly sure we won\u2019t find it in an algorithm.\n\n\u2022 Gary Younge is editor-at-large for the Guardian", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Greg Jericho", "body": "There is little sadder than watching business groups and companies attempt to lobby in public by promising that they\u2019ll be good. This week the Business Council of Australia delivered a statement to the crossbench senators, signed by 10 CEOs of some of Australia\u2019s largest corporations, effectively begging them to pass the company tax cut legislation.\n\nBut the statement only served to reinforce just how weak the impact of the company tax cuts will be on the lives of most workers.\n\nThe statement pledged that \u201cif the Senate passes this important legislation we, as some of the nation\u2019s largest employers, commit to invest more in Australia which will lead to employing more Australians and therefore stronger wage growth as the tax cut takes effect\u201d.\n\nPresumably this means if the legislation is not passed they will not commit to investing more in Australia?\n\nIt should be noted that while companies are crying out for a tax cut in order to employ more Australians, this week saw the government boasting of record level of employment growth. Similarly non-mining investment in the past year grew by 10% \u2013 the best result in four years and double the 30-year average annual growth of 5%.\n\nThat this can be achieved under such a high company tax rate must surely rank as an economic miracle.\n\nOf course, none of the CEOs of the 10 companies (five of which paid no tax in 2015-16) outlined any actual investments they are holding off on making unless the company tax cut goes through.\n\nIndeed because the tax cut for companies with a turnover of more than $1bn a year is only set to occur in 2022-23, and will only fully be cut to 25% in 2026-27, any suggestion of investment decisions not occurring would be based not on the current company tax rate, but on what they anticipate it will be.\n\nThat length of time also hurts the companies\u2019 and government\u2019s argument about \u201cstronger wage growth\u201d.\n\nThere is absolutely no basis for arguing a tax cut will bring about stronger wage growth immediately. The government might hope you will believe that, but none of their reasoning for the cut suggests it will happen.\n\nA company tax cut theoretically leads to stronger wage growth because firstly such a cut is supposed to increase (mostly foreign) investment in equipment, machinery and infrastructure that in turn leads to an increase in productivity.\n\nOnce that productivity increase occurs, then and only then wages growth will increase because the companies are producing more with the same amount of labour. They will thus seek to employ more and will not only raise wages to reward productivity improvements but also to entice workers to either stay or come work for them.\n\nBut of course that end result is not only predicated on productivity improvements actually leading to increased employment (which is in no way a certain thing) but also that workers will be in a position to bargain for higher wages.\n\nAnd remember as well, even according to the government\u2019s own research the improved wages growth only is to occur \u201cin the long term\u201d. And just how large that theoretical wages rise would be is also up for debate.\n\nTreasury estimated a company tax cut would lead to a long-term ongoing real wage increase of 0.4%, but new research by ANU economist Chris Murphy, which takes into account the recent changes in the US company tax rate, suggests it would be just 0.29% if financed by bracket creep.\n\nAnother new study by University of NSW Business School\u2019sprofessor of finance, Peter Swan, whose work in the 1980s for the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Financial System led to the Hawke government introducing the dividend imputation system, suggests the company tax cut won\u2019t even lead to increased foreign investment.\n\nHe argues that \u201cinvestment in Australia is already at its globally efficient untaxed level\u201d as foreign investors are already able to take advantage of tax laws that allow them to sell shares before dividend payments are made and then buy them back afterwards. He argues this negates the impact of the tax cut and that \u201ceven if the Australian corporate tax rate is reduced from 30% to 25%, there should be no new foreign investment, but more Australians should invest offshore due to the lower tax impost\u201d.\n\nHe concludes that \u201cconsequently, the tax cut plan is redundant with no billions of dollars\u2019 worth of desirable foreign investments left lying on the table\u201d.\n\nSenator Derryn Hinch was right to call the BCA\u2019s statement as \u201cvery kumbaya\u201d. There will be no way to prove any company has either increased investment or wages due to the tax cut, but there will be \u2013 as was the case in the US \u2013 lots of claims that this has occurred.\n\nBut to believe companies will pay higher wages because of this tax cut requires a great deal of naivety.\n\nWhich bring us to Senator Pauline Hanson who agreed to support the tax cut, despite having previously spoken out against it because, as she told the ABC, she was able to get funding for a \u201cpilot program\u201d for 1,000 apprentices in private business.\n\nThe ALP quickly noted the government has cut apprenticeships by 140,000 places since 2013.\n\nThe ALP is however being rather misleading about apprentice levels.\n\nA recent study by the Mitchell Institute found most of the drop in apprentices has actually been due to a drop in one-year \u201ctraineeships\u201d due to measures brought in by the Julia Gillard government to stop rorting by employers and training providers.\n\nBut even if we only focus on the more traditional \u201ctrade\u201d industries, in 2017 there were 168,000 apprentices \u2013 down 41,000 from the 209,000 in 2013. That makes Senator Hanson\u2019s 1,000 apprentices program rather small beer, and must have had the government senators laughing at how cheaply she folded.

Projections suggest that in the two decades to 2030, 3 million hectares of untouched forest will have been bulldozed in eastern Australia.\n\nThe crisis is driven primarily by a booming livestock industry but is ushered in by governments that fail to introduce restrictions and refuse to apply existing restrictions.\n\nAnd more than just trees are at stake.\n\n\n\nAustralia has an awesome biodiversity, with nearly 8% of all Earth\u2019s plant and animal species finding a home on the continent. About 85% of the country\u2019s plants, 84% of its mammals and 45% of its birds are found nowhere else.\n\nBut land clearing is putting that at risk. About three-quarters of Australia\u2019s 1,640 plants and animals listed by the government as threatened have habitat loss listed as one of their main threats.\n\nMuch of the land clearing in Queensland \u2013 which accounts for the majority in Australia \u2013 drives pollution into rivers that drain on to the Great Barrier Reef, adding to the pressures it.\n\nAnd of course land clearing is exacerbating climate change. In 1990, before short-lived land-clearing controls came into place, a quarter of Australia\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions were caused by deforestation. Emissions from land clearing dropped after 2010 but are rising sharply again.\n\n\u201cIt has gotten so bad that WWF International put it on the list of global deforestation fronts, the only one in the developed world on that list,\u201d says Martin Taylor, the protected areas and conservation science manager at WWF Australia.\n\nIn Queensland, where there is both the most clearing and the best data on clearing, trees are being bulldozed at a phenomenal rate.\n\n\n\nAbout 395,000 hectares of native vegetation were cleared there in 2015-16, 33% more compared with the previous year. And despite the re-elected Labor government promising changes to rein it in, notifications of planned land clearing in Queensland have jumped a further 30%, suggesting woodlands could be bulldozed even faster in coming years.\n\nTo visualise what clearing of that magnitude looks like, Guardian Australia has created a tool that will lay an area that size over any location you choose. Mapped over Sydney, for example, 395,000 hectares covers an area stretching from the central coast in the north, to Campbeltown in the south, and the Blue Mountains in the west.\n\nThat equates to more than 1,500 football fields worth of native woodland and scrub being cleared each and every day in Queensland.\n\nStopping the clearing in Queensland is possible. Indeed, under its Labor premier Peter Beattie it brought its land clearing problem under control. Tough laws passed in 2004 meant that by 2010 land clearing had dropped to an all-time low of about 92,000 hectares.\n\nBut when the Liberal National party\u2019s Campbell Newman was elected in 2012 he broke an election promise to keep the laws, gutted them, and introduced several ways for farmers to clear land easily. The bulldozers roared back into action immediately, bringing the state to the point it is at now.\n\nQueensland clears more land each year than the rest of Australia put together, and the rate at which it is destroying its vegetation is comparable with the infamous deforestation that occurs in the Brazilian Amazon. Brazil bulldozes about 0.25% of its part of the Amazon each year; Queensland clears about 0.45% of its remaining wooded areas.\n\nThe recently re-elected Queensland Labor government has promised to change the laws. But in the meantime other states have begun to follow Queensland\u2019s lead.\n\nIn 2016 the New South Wales Coalition government announced it was going to axe three pieces of legislation that protected native vegetation and wildlife, and replace them with a single act that would make land clearing easier.\n\nA conservation scientist from the University of Queensland, Hugh Possingham, sat on the NSW government\u2019s advisory board for the changes but resigned in protest, warning they could lead to a doubling of clearing rates in NSW.\n\nPossingham says exactly how much the laws will impact clearing rates is unclear, since there are other drivers of clearing, including climate and economics. \u201cBut if you look at Queensland, their example is so dramatic,\u201d he says of the effects of law changes there.\n\nDaisy Barham, from the Nature Conservation Council of NSW, says the final set of laws and regulations released are even worse than those that caused the land clearing crisis in Queensland. \u201cThere are some really extreme elements in the NSW laws that don\u2019t even feature in the Queensland laws,\u201d she says.\n\nBarham says the worst is the \u201cequity code\u201d which leaves few controls on clearing of properties under 100 hectares, and where protected vegetation makes up less than 10% of the property.\n\nAnalysis by WWF shows that could allow clearing of 8 million hectares, or 38% of the remaining trees in the state, under that rule alone.\n\nThe changes took effect in August 2017 but so far the government has refused to release data on how much clearing has taken place. In fact, official state data hasn\u2019t been released since 2013-14, when about 30,000 hectares of trees were cleared in NSW.\n\nThe area being cleared in there may seem small relative to Queensland, but NSW has a much smaller amount of remaining vegetation, with clearing there starting much earlier after colonisation.\n\n\u201cOnly 9% of NSW is in a healthy or near-natural condition,\u201d Barham says. \u201cWe simply don\u2019t have much left to lose. That is why every bit of clearing in NSW is so important.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, further north, vast tracts of land are being earmarked for clearing. In the relatively lawless Northern Territory, approvals for land clearing have jumped more than tenfold in the past two years, compared with the preceding 12 years, according to figures from the NT government analysed by the Wilderness Society.\n\nSome of the clearing approved for single properties in the NT is almost unimaginable in size. A property called Tipperary station has a total of 50,687 hectares approved for clearing through a number of separate applications over the past six years, an area almost 10 times the size of Manhattan on one property.\n\nDavid Morris, a lawyer who was chief executive of the Environmental Defenders Office NT until earlier this year, says the overarching feature of the Northern Territory\u2019s land clearing is the lack of regulation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a totally inept regulatory regime,\u201d says Morris, who is now chief executive of the Environmental Defenders Office NSW. He says land-clearing projects go through an environmental assessment framework, which the government has admitted is inadequate. \u201cThey\u2019ve committed to reform it but in the meantime all approvals go through this very poor assessment regime.\u201d\n\nIn addition, major land-clearing proposals that occur on pastoral leases are assessed by a body called the Pastoral Lands Board, which adds further problems.\n\n\u201cIt is made up of four pastoralists and one rangelands scientist,\u201d Morris says. \u201cThere is a very clear trend of increased approvals of broad-scale land clearing in the Northern Territory. And there is a regulatory regime that is incapable of dealing with the individual and cumulative impacts of that clearing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving a board full of agricultural business people as the ultimate decision maker is mind-boggling,\u201d says Glenn Walker, a Wilderness Society climate campaign manager. Glenn Walker, adding: \u201cThe NT has the worst regulation for deforestation of any jurisdiction in Australia.\u201d\n\nAnd the spread of the land-clearing crisis doesn\u2019t look set to stop in the NT. Some of Australia\u2019s richest graziers are establishing cattle stations in Western Australia, and making claims for greater access to resources in the pristine Kimberley.\n\nOther states have their own clearing tragedies unfolding: some of Australia\u2019s most majestic and oldest trees are being cut down for timber by a state-owned company in Victoria, which has even less left to lose than NSW. And Tasmania has just signed up to allow more logging in its national parks until at least 2037, a move NSW and Victoria are considering following.\n\nCombined, eastern Australia is considered a global deforestation hotspot, the only one in the developed world. According to analysis by WWF\u2019s Martin Taylor, Australia is likely to lose 3 million hectares of trees in the next 15 years.\n\nAnd all that is putting things Australians care most about under threat.\n\n\u201cIf you care about the Great Barrier Reef, then that\u2019s what you care about,\u201d he says. The effects of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef are multiplied by land clearing in Queensland, since it increases the amount of sediment that flows into rivers, and eventually on to the coral. That can starve them of light, and decrease their resilience to other impacts.\n\nWWF analysis estimated that 45 million animals are killed each year in Queensland, just from the bulldozing of their habitat. \u201cPeople have very strong feelings about cruelty and mistreatment of animals,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cSo what must they think of that then? That we\u2019re bulldozing 45 million animals to death every year?\u201d\n\nBoth in Australia and around the world, habitat loss is by far the biggest threat to animals facing extinction.\n\n\u201cIf you care about koalas, and if you care about Australian wildlife \u2013 if you want your kids to see them \u2013 then that\u2019s what you care about,\u201d he says.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Staff", "body": "Tens of thousands of Slovaks have rallied to demand the resignation of prime minister Robert Fico\u2019s government following the murder of a journalist that has shocked the central European nation and stoked anger over sleaze in public life.\n\nJan Kuciak and his fiancee, Martina Kusnirova, both 27, were found shot dead at their home near Bratislava on 25 February.

On its website it says that it is \u201chere for every step of the journey away from homelessness\u201d and says that its outreach teams work to \u201cgradually build up trusting relationships\u201d with people who are sleeping rough.\n\n\n\nBut St Mungo\u2019s has admitted to the Guardian that it has cooperated with Home Office immigration, compliance, and enforcement (Ice) teams when they go looking for rough sleepers who are in the UK illegally.\n\nThe Home Office\u2019s approach is so controversial that it has since been deemed unlawful in some cases. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has suspended cooperation with the Ice patrols.\n\nBut a September 2016 Home Office training document obtained by the Guardian, which features the St Mungo\u2019s logo, states: \u201cThis teamwork which sees both the charity referring eligible people to immigration enforcement [IE] for help with voluntary returns and IE referring people to St Mungo\u2019s has already proved beneficial for both bodies.\u201d\n\nAsked about its work with the Home Office, St Mungo\u2019s admitted that some of its contracts with local authorities have specified that they should work with Ice teams. \u201cI get why that can be seen as strange and unpopular for some people,\u201d said Petra Salva, the charity\u2019s director of rough sleeping services. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult climate we\u2019re operating in.\u201d\n\nAsked about the work described in the 2016 document, Salva described how officials from Home Office enforcement teams \u201cgo up to individuals sleeping in sleeping bags and interview them, sometimes they end up arresting them\u201d.\n\nAsked to clarify whether its teams still worked with Home Office patrols, a spokesperson for the charity said: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe our outreach staff have accompanied Ice teams this year.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt continues to work with the Home Office by passing on details of people from other countries who wish to return home.\n\nThe disclosure of its past work with the Home Office drew criticism from elsewhere in the charitable sector. The North East London Migrant Action group said: \u201cThe role of homelessness charities should be to uphold the rights of vulnerable people. St Mungo\u2019s have forfeited the trust of asylum seekers and other migrants who sleep rough by working with the Home Office who have people deported from the UK.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur advice to the rough sleepers we support will be to think twice about engaging with commissioned outreach services and, where possible, to seek help instead from independent charities.\u201d\n\nCrisis, one of the UK\u2019s leading homelessness charities, referred the Guardian to a statement from June last year which does not refer to St Mungo\u2019s but states: \u201cIf it is true that people are avoiding help from outreach teams for fear of encountering the Home Office, then these people will become more vulnerable, not less.\u201d\n\nThe Home Office uses various methods to remove people considered to have no right to be in the UK. These include encouraging migrants to return home voluntarily, sometimes with a package of support, and enforced removal for those who won\u2019t leave willingly. \n\n\n\nSt Mungo\u2019s acknowledges on its website: \u201cWhere local authorities or the Home Office decide to take action against individuals or groups who are sleeping rough, we do work with them in order to ensure that people who are vulnerable get the help that they need.\u201d\n\nEven when people return voluntarily, some say that they do so out of a sense that they have no choice. One asylum seeker who agreed to return to Uganda, a country he had previously fled following government persecution, said: \u201cI agreed to return home voluntarily after my case was refused as I didn\u2019t feel I had any other option. But I am in hiding and fear for my life. Nobody monitors our safety after we have returned.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Home Office\u2019s approach to removing foreign nationals who are sleeping rough has been a matter of controversy for some time. In December, a high court ruling found that its policy on EEA nationals, which deemed that sleeping on the streets was an abuse of EU free movement rights, was unlawful.\n\nA Home Office spokeswoman said that since the high court ruling they have suspended the Ice patrols. The spokeswoman said that instead the Home Office was working with a cross-government team to provide support to rough sleepers.\n\nThe London mayor told the Guardian that after the decision his office suspended joint working with the Home Office on removals of rough sleepers deemed to be in the country illegally.\n\nWhile it says that it no longer goes out with Ice teams, St Mungo\u2019s continues to cooperate with the Home Office.\n\nSalva said that St Mungo\u2019s workers highlighted the vulnerability of many rough sleepers to Home Office enforcement teams and that if they observed poor Home Office practice while out with the Ice teams they provided feedback about this.\n\nIn a statement that addressed its work with the Home Office in more general teams last year, St Mungo\u2019s said: \u201cWe do not share information about people to the Home Office, except when an individual has given their consent.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Sadiq Khan said: \u201cThe mayor has always been very clear that he is completely opposed to the Home Office policy that denied non-UK nationals sleeping rough access to services, and leaves them vulnerable to being returned home with no support waiting for them.

On civil rights and the environmental crisis, the most important issues of his lifetime, he championed the wrong policies.\n\nGraham was on the wrong side of history.\n\nThe world\u2019s most famous evangelist let his apocalyptic anticipation of the coming kingdom of God blind him to the realities of living in this world.\n\nFor Graham, the Bible had a clear message for Christians living in what he believed were humans\u2019 last days on earth. Individuals alone can achieve salvation; governments cannot. Conversions change behaviors; federal policies do not.\n\nThese convictions shaped the evangelist\u2019s views on civil rights.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Graham integrated his revivals and seemed to support the burgeoning civil rights movement. This is the Graham most Americans remember.\n\n\n\nBut as the movement grew, expanded, and became increasingly confrontational, the evangelist\u2019s position changed.\n\nOnce leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr began practicing civil disobedience and asking for the federal government to guarantee African Americans\u2019 rights, Graham\u2019s support evaporated.\n\nWithin days of the publication of King\u2019s famous 1963 Letter from a Birmingham Jail, Graham told reporters that the Baptist minister should \u201cput the brakes on a little bit.\u201d\n\nHe criticized civil rights activists for focusing on changing laws rather than hearts.\n\nIn 1971, Graham published The Jesus Generation, a book on the coming apocalypse. Looking for signs of Jesus\u2019s Second Coming had become an obsession of Graham\u2019s, as it was for millions of other evangelicals in the mid-20th century.\n\nIn the book Graham praised the wisdom of young people who rejected the federal government as a tool for rectifying injustices.\n\n\u201cThese young people,\u201d he explained, \u201cdon\u2019t put much stock in the old slogans of the New Deal, the Fair Deal, the New Frontier, and the Great Society. They believe that utopia will arrive only when Jesus returns. Thus these young people are on sound Biblical ground.\u201d\n\nFor six decades Graham taught Americans that the federal government could not be an instrument of God to bring about justice, not on race matters and not on other significant issues. Although he believed in racial equality, his theology blinded him to what we now know was the best means for achieving that equality.\n\nMore recently, the evangelist denied the threat of global warming as well as federal efforts to stymie it.\n\nIn a 1992 book focused on the signs that the world was nearing its end, the preacher suggested that if humankind was going to survive, businesses needed to reduce pollution and stop contributing to global warming.\n\nIn a revised, 2010 version of the book, Graham eliminated the phrase \u201cglobal warming\u201d from the text altogether. Global warming no longer existed in the mind of Graham as a real threat.\n\nHe went on to assure readers that the earth will not \u201cbe saved through legislation.\u201d The federal government, he indicated, had no business passing laws to protect the earth for future generations.\n\nGraham\u2019s positions on civil rights and the environment are not those of a right-wing crank, or of a paranoid anti-intellectual. Graham takes his Bible and his theology seriously. The political positions he has embraced derive from a careful and serious study of the scriptures.\n\nGraham came of age during Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s massive expansion of government power. But rather than join with social gospel advocates like Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins in promoting the creation of a welfare state to serve the needy, the future evangelist was more influenced by apocalypse-obsessed, fundamentalist rabble rousers who rejected New Deal liberalism.\n\nGraham, like most fundamentalists of his generation, determined that the New Deal state represented godless competition for the churches rather than a potential ally.\n\nThis is a message that appeared again and again in Graham\u2019s many books on Jesus\u2019s Second Coming. Only the return of Jesus will right social wrongs, he concluded.\n\nThe expansion of state power, in contrast, was a necessary precursor to the rise of the Antichrist. The evangelist felt sure that as we approach the end of time, the world\u2019s governments were going to take away Christians\u2019 rights and liberties.\n\nThe New Deal with its intrusive regulations was the first step, Obamacare with its contraception mandates the most recent.\n\nYet Graham insisted that the inevitability of the Second Coming was no justification for indifference. \u201cWe must not feel that we are to sit back and do nothing to fight evil just because some day the four horsemen will come with full and final force upon the earth,\u201d Graham wrote. Instead, he prodded evangelicals to elect people to office who shared his anti-statist worldview.\n\nThey did. White evangelicals played an outsized role in recent political campaigns, supporting every Republican presidential candidate from Ronald Reagan to Donald J Trump.\n\nGraham had the opportunity to lead fundamentalists into a new era. He could have pushed them to take social reform seriously as a God-given mandate to save the world from environmental destruction. He could have tackled racism, America\u2019s original sin, by championing the federal government\u2019s aggressive civil rights policies.\n\nBut he squandered it. He could not overcome the speculative end-times schemes of his cohort of evangelicals, with their anti-government hostilities.\n\nGraham had good intentions, as his work desegregating his crusades demonstrated. But when his influence really would have counted, when he could have effected real change, real social transformation, he was too locked into last-days fearmongering to recognize the potential of the state to do good. We are all paying the price.\n\nA different kind of last days may soon be upon us. Racial tensions are rising, the earth is warming, and evangelicals are doing little to help. That may be Graham\u2019s most significant, and saddest, legacy.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Michael Slezak", "body": "Some of Australia\u2019s favourite birds are threatened with extinction and Australia\u2019s environmental laws are failing to protect them, a new report by BirdLife Australia has found.\n\n\n\nThe report identified in the existing laws a slew of loopholes, exemptions, omissions and discretionary powers open to politicisation, each of which have been exploited to allow the decline of birds including the Carnaby\u2019s black cockatoo, the swift parrot and the southern black-throated finch.\n\n\u201cThe Turnbull government must urgently reform our national environment laws and ensure they are properly upheld,\u201d said Jenny Lau, BirdLife Australia\u2019s acting head of conservation.\n\nThe report attempts to build a case for what the Australian Panel of Experts on Environmental Law, working in conjunction with the Places You Love Alliance, called a blueprint for the next generation of environmental laws.\n\nThat blueprint called for national oversight to be expanded to cover land clearing, impacts on climate change and protected areas, as well as the establishment of a national sustainability commission, which would have real power to manage cumulative impacts on the environment that are often not considered over hundreds of individual decisions.\n\nThe spectacular Carnaby\u2019s black cockatoo in Western Australia illustrates the way ministerial discretion opens the way for politicisation, the report said.\n\nDespite being listed as endangered under federal environment law, its population has declined by between 5% and 11% each year since 2010. Pine plantations have become an important habitat for the bird but those are being harvested, without replacement, at a rate of 1,000 hectares per year since 2004. The plantation has declined from 23,000 ha at one point to 7,000 ha today, the report said.\n\nBirdLife Australia said it had written to state and federal environment ministers requesting that \u201charvesting without replacement\u201d of those plantations be considered a \u201ccontrolled action\u201d, and therefore subject to federal environmental assessment. Although the federal minister has the power to determine it as a \u201ccontrolled action,\u201d BirdLife said that hasn\u2019t happened, showing the system is vulnerable to politicisation.\n\nMeanwhile, exemptions and loopholes to federal environment law have meant it isn\u2019t able to protect the critically endangered swift parrot, which now numbers fewer than 1,000 pairs in the wild.\n\nRegional forest agreements are 20-year plans that allow the logging industry to harvest trees from native forests, and exempt the actions from restrictions in federal environmental law. As some of them are expiring, they have either been, or are in the process of being, rolled over for another 20 years.\n\nThe report said that despite the swift parrot being determined a \u201cpriority species\u201d in some RFAs, its habitat has been routinely felled in native forests over the past 20 years.\n\nCumulative impacts fail to be properly considered by existing environmental law too, the report said. The black-throated finch, despite being extinct in NSW and endangered under federal environmental law, has had its occurrence contract by 80% in the past 30 years.\n\nThe report said that has occurred through hundreds of small developments, each of which has a relatively small impact but is cumulatively threatening the species with extinction. It notes 772 projects that overlap on black-throated finch habitat have been referred for assessment under federal environmental law, but for the majority of those it was determined they could go ahead without federal assessment.\n\n\u201cMost of those applications were approved without consideration of the cumulative impacts on our finches,\u201d said Lau. \u201cDecisions to approve developments that destroy habitat are being made in isolation from one another and as a result the southern black-throated finch is now headed for extinction.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor other species, especially those that only exist on islands \u2013 such as the King Island scrubtit and the King Island brown thornbill \u2013 there is no government agency tasked with collecting adequate information about the species in order to protect it.\n\nIn many other cases, threatened species are not having recovery plans established for them \u2013 something that was legally required to be created until an amendment to the law in 2007. BirdLife Australia analysis found that of the 67 nationally listed endangered and critically endangered birds, only 15 are covered by up-to-date recovery plans.\n\nThe opposition environment spokesman, Tony Burke, has said the push to introduce national laws would be considered at the ALP conference this year, and he was consulting about updating the act.\n\nBurke told the Guardian this week that existing laws need to be properly applied to protect threatened species.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t protect species without protecting habitat. That means using a series of powers available under law,\u201d Burke said.\n\n\u201cOne of the principle challenges when we have conservative governments in power is the section of the EPBC Act that deals with approvals are the only sections they are committed to. That leads down a pathway of offsets where the habitat is somewhere between 20 and 80 years away, protected areas which go backwards and conservation outcomes screech to a halt.\u201d\n\nThe office of the minister for energy and the environment, Josh Frydenberg, has been contacted for comment but he has previously said the existing act continues to be the best mechanism for the federal government to protect the most important and sensitive matters.\n\nThe report is being released ahead of a symposium called Better Laws for a Better Planet, hosted by a number of groups including the Australian Panel of Experts on Environmental Law and the IUCN National Committee Australia, on 27 March in Canberra.", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}, {"author": "Guy Verhofstadt", "body": "On Tuesday, Jean-Claude Juncker wrote to Vladimir Putin to congratulate him on his electoral success, presumably taking inspiration from the list of global demagogues and dictators who were also quick to send their congratulations, from President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela to President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus.\n\nPresident Trump followed, but at least his advisers had given express instruction: \u201cDO NOT CONGRATULATE\u201d. Which, of course, the American president ignored. Shamefully, neither Juncker nor Trump mentioned the deployment of Russian-made chemical weapons in Salisbury, nor did they raise concerns about the legitimacy of the so-called \u201celection\u201d we have just witnessed in Russia.\n\nMichael Link, the German MP who led the independent OSCE election-monitoring mission to Russia, has been clear that they found there was no \u201creal choice\u201d for voters. Voters were herded to polling booths, and ballot boxes stuffed, while the main opposition leader Alexei Navalny was banned from standing. So, no, this is no time for congratulations. Yes, we will always need dialogue with Russia, but closer ties must be conditional on respect for the rule of law.\n\nToo often, the west has rolled over while the Russian bear mauls our liberal democracies, corrupts our political systems, hacks our political parties, pollutes our online ecosystems, and seeks to drag European countries back to a violent and divided past. While European leaders have responded with warm words of support for Britain in the wake of the Salisbury incident, we need to deliver a serious collective European response that can be framed as part of a new EU strategy towards Russia.\n\nWith this new strategy we should show to Mr Putin that his violations of international law have clear consequences, but also open up the perspective of cooperation and engagement, provided Russia starts delivering on its commitments under international law and starting with the implementation of the Minsk agreements. Instead of sending congratulation letters, EU leaders, and in particular  Federica Mogherini, should therefore come up with such a proactive strategy. First of all she should push for clear EU-wide sanctions in response to the Sergei Skripal case. If there is one thing that truly alarms the mafia elite surrounding Putin, it is the prospect of being denied access to their European villas.\n\nIt is essential that Brexit does not weaken foreign policy and security cooperation across Europe. The European parliament\u2019s proposal for an umbrella EU\u2013UK Association Agreement sets out a framework for delivering this. We must ensure security and defence agreements are in place before the end of the transition period. We need a comprehensive, Mueller-style, EU-wide investigation into the extent of Russian influence on our democracies, economies and political systems, which can set out credible responses. It is wrong that Russian billionaires can buy EU citizenship in Malta, launder money in London property through shell companies and seemingly donate to European political parties at will.\n\nAt the same time we have to overcome the current stalemate where EU-Russia contacts are frozen, but member states continue developing bilateral channels with Russia, often serving narrow national interests. The EU and Nato need to reopen channels of communication to reduce the risk of misunderstandings and miscalculations \u2013 as was the case during the cold war.\n\nA new strategy could be built on the logic of the Helsinki process of the 1970s. A Helsinki 2.0 would strengthen European security architecture through opening up the perspective for a political and economic engagement with Russia. In exchange for full respect of the Minsk agreements, compliance with international law and also progress when it comes to free and fair elections and respect for human rights inside Russia, the EU would not only lift economic sanctions but progressively deepen political and economic cooperation.\n\nThis strategy would also make clear that our dispute is with the current Russian government, not with the Russian people. We should therefore open our universities and labour markets to the best and brightest young Russians citizens and unilaterally facilitate visas for Russian citizens. Support for independent civil society activists, the free media and NGOs in Russia should be enhanced.\n\nMost importantly, we have to swiftly build a Defence Union, as a European pillar of Nato. For decades, we have relied on the US and failed to invest in modern defences and the integration of our capacities. Many European politicians refuse to make the case to the people for a European defence and security capacity, for fear of falling foul of the Eurosceptics that Putin sponsors; we find ourselves trapped in a vicious cycle.\n\nI hope the younger generation of current European leaders, from Emmanuel Macron to Leo Varadkar, will have the courage to be bolder and make the case for an integrated European defence.\n\nMany don\u2019t want to accept the truth because it means hard choices have to be made, but the reality is that the Kremlin is again at war with our liberal democracies. If we don\u2019t respond with a new long-term strategy, Putin will be emboldened.\n\n\u2022 Guy Verhofstadt is chief Brexit representative for the European parliament", "link": null, "source": "The Guardian", "location": [{"country": "GB", "state": null, "city": "London"}]}]
