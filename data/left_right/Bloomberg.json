[{"author": "Jennifer A Dlouhy", "body": "Russian hackers are conducting a broad assault on the U.S. electric grid, water processing plants, air transportation facilities and other targets in rolling attacks on some of the country\u2019s most sensitive infrastructure, U.S. government officials said Thursday.\nThe announcement was the first official confirmation that Russian hackers have taken aim at facilities on which hundreds of millions of Americans depend for basic services. Bloomberg News reported in July that Russian hackers had breached more than a dozen power plants in seven states, an aggressive campaign that has since expanded to dozens of states, according to a person familiar with the investigation.\n\"Since at least March 2016, Russian government cyber actors\" have targeted \"government entities and multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors,\" including those of energy, nuclear, water and aviation, according to an alert issued Thursday by the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        Critical manufacturing sectors and commercial facilities also have been targeted by the ongoing \"multi-stage intrusion campaign by Russian government cyber actors.\"\nCyber-attacks are \"literally happening hundreds of thousands of times a day,\" Energy Secretary Rick Perry told lawmakers during a hearing Thursday. \"The warfare that goes on in the cyberspace is real, it\u2019s serious, and we must lead the world.\"\nSeparately Thursday, the U.S. sanctioned a St. Petersburg-based \u201ctroll farm,\u201d two Russian intelligence services, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian citizens and businesses indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on charges of meddling with the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\nA joint analysis by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security described hackers as extremely sophisticated, in some cases first breaching suppliers and third-party vendors before hopping from those networks to their ultimate target. The government\u2019s report did not say how successful the attacks were.\nRead More: Russia Is Said to Be Suspect in Hacks of U.S. Power Plants\n\n        \n        The Russian hackers \"targeted small commercial facilities\u2019 networks where they staged malware, conducted spear phishing, and gained remote access into energy sector networks,\" according to the Homeland Security alert.\nThe hackers deliberately selected targets and methodically went after initial victims as a way to reach their ultimate prizes, including industrial control systems used by power plants and other infrastructure. Their tactics included sending spear-phishing emails and embedding malicious content on informational websites to obtain security credentials they could then leverage for more information and access.\nAnd once they obtained access, the attackers \"conducted network reconnaissance,\" and moved within the systems to collect information on industrial control systems.\n\n        \n        The government\u2019s alert on Russian cyber-attacks does not cover suspected meddling by the country in the 2016 election.\nAn October report by researchers at Symantec Corp., cited by the U.S. government Thursday, linked the attacks to a group of hackers it had code-named Dragonfly, and said it found evidence critical infrastructure facilities in Turkey and Switzerland also had been breached.\nThe Symantec researchers said an earlier wave of attacks by the same group starting in 2011 was used to gather intelligence on companies and their operational systems. The hackers then used that information for a more advanced wave of attacks targeting industrial control systems that, if disabled, leave millions without power or water.\nThe disclosure comes amid mounting calls from lawmakers to step up protection of the nation\u2019s electric grid. Senator Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, pushed for a cyberthreat assessment of the grid last year, to better defend the infrastructure against potential attacks.\n\"I hope today\u2019s belated response is the first step in a robust and aggressive strategy to protect our critical infrastructure,\" Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state, said in an emailed statement.\nU.S. intelligence officials have long been concerned about the security of the country\u2019s electrical grid. The recent attacks, striking almost simultaneously at multiple locations, are testing the government\u2019s ability to coordinate an effective response among several private utilities, state and local officials, and industry regulators.\nMany of the targeted power plants are conventional, but the attacks included at least one nuclear power plant in Kansas, Bloomberg News reported in July. While the core of a nuclear generator is heavily protected, a sudden shutdown of the turbine can trigger safety systems. These safety devices are designed to disperse excess heat while the nuclear reaction is halted, but the safety systems themselves may be vulnerable to attack.\nThe operating systems at nuclear plants also tend to be legacy controls built decades ago and don\u2019t have digital control systems that can be exploited by hackers.\n\u2014 With assistance by Toluse Olorunnipa, Ari Natter, and Nafeesa Syeed", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Andrew Mayeda", "body": "In a two-week span, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered up an array of tariffs against numerous countries, blocked Chinese takeovers of U.S. companies and sought new restrictions on future Chinese investment. Economists are warning that the world is on the verge of an all-out trade war, featuring tit-for-tat reprisals, heated rhetoric and appeals to the World Trade Organization, which may be ill-equipped to respond. If Trump\u2019s trade provocations mushroom out of control, dozens of border-opening trade deals negotiated over several decades could be shoved aside. The prospect of slower economic growth has stock markets worldwide reeling.\n1. What is a trade war?The dictionary says it\u2019s\u00a0\u201can economic conflict in which countries impose import restrictions on each other in order to harm each other\u2019s trade.\u201d Trump\u2019s tariffs and the threatened retaliation from other countries meet this definition, but so do centuries of protectionist skirmishes by numerous countries in countless sectors.\u00a0The recent escalation is stoking fears that Trump has touched off a full-blown trade war by singling out of China for retaliation for intellectual property theft. The quid-pro-quo actions by the U.S. and China over steel tariffs, Trump\u2019s invocation of national security to justify some of his moves -- which could open a Pandora\u2019s Box of similar claims by other nations -- and Trump\u2019s threat to further punish the EU if it imposes counter-duties also add to the trade-war atmospherics.\n2. What happened in previous trade wars?One of the most notorious examples is the Smoot-Hawley Act passed by Congress in 1930 and\u00a0often blamed for deepening the Great Depression. The law hiked U.S. tariffs by an average of 20 percent, initially to protect American farmers but then broadened as other industries lobbied for protections. As demand collapsed, countries scrambled to maintain their gold reserves by devaluing their currencies or imposing even more trade barriers. Global trade fell off a cliff.\n3. Who wins in trade wars?\n        \n        No one, if history is any guide.\u00a0When President George W. Bush raised steel tariffs in 2002, U.S. gross domestic product declined by $30.4 million, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. The U.S. lost about 200,000 jobs, about 13,000 of which were in raw steel-making, by one estimate. A report by the pro-free trade Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that Bush\u2019s tariffs cost about $400,000 for every steel-industry job saved.\u00a0The World Trade Organization also ruled that the Bush tariffs were illegal.\u00a0\n4. What has Trump done so far?\nHe\u2019s imposing tariffs on up to $60 billion of as-yet unspecified products imported from China in retaliation for what he calls decades of intellectual property theft. He imposed tariffs of 25 percent and 10 percent, respectively, on steel and aluminum imports, which prompted China to say it could hit back with tariffs of its own. While he temporarily exempted allies, including the European Union, from the metals tariffs, he expects them to grant concessions to the U.S. to maintain the exemption.\n5. Why did Trump invite this fight?In a March 2 Twitter post, he declared trade wars \u201cgood, and easy to win.\u201d His focus remains reducing the U.S. trade deficit, which shows the country imports hundreds of billions of dollars more than it exports. Stepping back from trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership also appeals to Trump\u2019s base of voters in America\u2019s Rust Belt. But talk of a trade war is alarming to many U.S. business leaders, who largely support existing trade deals, and the securities markets, which fear lower profits and slower economic growth if the U.S. turns protectionist and other countries retaliate.\n6. Who has retaliated?So far, China said it would hit $3 billion of U.S. wine, fruit, steel pipe and other exports with tariffs. The bigger worry for the U.S. is that China, the U.S.\u2019s biggest creditor, will scale back purchases of Treasuries in retaliation. China\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. doesn\u2019t rule out the option. Other countries haven\u2019t retaliated for the steel and aluminum tariffs, which took effect March 23, largely because Trump temporarily exempted many of them. Still, the EU is unhappy and warned it will respond with its own 25 percent tariffs on $3.5 billion of American goods, particularly iconic U.S. brands produced in states that are part of Trump\u2019s political base.\u00a0The list includes motorcycles, blue jeans and bourbon whiskey. In turn, Trump warned that he would impose a 25 percent penalty on European car imports if the EU carried out its threat.\n7. When does the WTO get involved?The U.S. took the first step on March 23, filing a \"request for consultations\" with China at the WTO on technology licensing. China also notified the WTO how it could respond to the steel tariffs with levies of its own. But retaliatory actions that unfold quickly can test the WTO\u2019s somewhat ponderous deliberative process. The arbiter of international trade disputes was born in 1995 out of a set of agreements struck by countries trying to reduce trade barriers. If a government\u2019s complaint about another nation\u2019s trade barriers is seen as grounded, the WTO recommends acceptable retaliation. In the case of steel, Trump is invoking a seldom-used clause of a 1962 U.S. law that gives him the authority to curb imports if they undermine national security. Under WTO rules,\u00a0countries can take trade actions to protect \u201cessential security interests.\u201d Other nations could challenge the validity of the U.S. use of that clause. They also could copy the U.S. move by citing national security to block imports themselves.\n8. Could tariffs backfire on the U.S.?\n        \n        Yes. Take steel tariffs. Many more people are employed in industries, such as auto manufacturing, that buy steel to make products, than in steel-making itself. Some consumers may also have to pay higher prices. Trade tensions could boost inflation more than desired by Federal Reserve policy makers, who might feel the need to raise rates more aggressively than planned. On the other hand, if the tariffs result in job losses and the economy slows, the Fed might want to ease the pace of rate hikes.\n9. Are tariffs the only weapon in trade wars?No, there are many others. Clamping down on Chinese investments in the U.S., which Trump is already doing, is one example. Talking down, or manipulating lower, one\u2019s currency is another. Countries through the years have used other means to keep foreign goods out and protect homegrown companies, a practice known as mercantilism. Trump accuses China of using government subsidies to prop up its domestic industries. Some practices are overt, such as quotas, and others covert, such as unusual product specifications, lengthy inspections of goods at entry ports and intricate licensing requirements.\nThe Reference ShelfQuickTake explainers on Trump\u2019s claim that China stole U.S. intellectual property, the 1962 law Trump cited for his steel tariffs, the difficulty of the U.S. quitting Nafta and Trump\u2019s solar-panel tariffs.

In a proposal sent to Baev shortly before Trump\u2019s January 2017 inauguration, Broidy sketched out a potential campaign to influence top U.S. officials, according to a person with knowledge of the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nThe plan never went forward, Broidy and Baev said, and no such lobbying took place. But the discussions are a striking illustration of how Russians\u2019 efforts to escape sanctions led them to seek political allies close to Trump. Broidy, a Los Angeles money manager and deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a written statement to Bloomberg that he didn\u2019t offer to \u201cpersonally\u201d set up meetings with top U.S. officials for Baev\u2019s clients.

The documents, both of which were labeled drafts, were sent from similar email addresses using the name LA Confidential. Bloomberg couldn\u2019t verify the authenticity of the documents, which are identical except for proposed fee amounts and minor formatting differences.\nLA Confidential has been distributing unflattering emails and documents about Broidy to media outlets in recent weeks. Broidy said the documents were stolen from his computer servers and, in some cases, altered or combined with fabrications. People close to Broidy said many stolen emails were deleted from his server, making it difficult to determine whether documents were tampered with before being leaked to the media.\nA fixture in Republican fundraising circles for decades, Broidy is a staunch supporter of Israel and has business interests in the Middle East. During the presidential campaign, he served as a vice chairman of Trump\u2019s joint fundraising committee.\n\n        \n        Broidy, who supports the blockade of Qatar, has accused agents of that gulf state\u2019s government of hacking his computer servers and orchestrating the media leaks. Previous disclosures from LA Confidential described a scrapped proposal for Broidy to help a Malaysian businessman under U.S. criminal investigation. Another set of documents detailed his advocacy work in Washington in support of the United Arab Emirates, where a private security firm he controls has a government contract.\n\n        \n        Earlier: Trump Fundraiser\u2019s Email Breach Shows Risks Before Midterms\nLee Wolosky, an attorney for Broidy at Boies Schiller  Flexner LLP, sent a letter this week to Qatar\u2019s embassy in Washington citing \u201cirrefutable forensic evidence tying Qatar\u201d to the theft of his emails and threatening \u201clegal remedies.\u201d\nBroidy\u2019s \u201cbaseless accusations are just more diversionary tactics by him,\u201d a spokesman for the Qatari embassy said Tuesday. \u201cQatar has not engaged in any of the activities alleged by Mr. Broidy.\u201d\nMoscow LawyerWith law degrees from institutions in Russia and California, Baev has worked for corporate law firms in the U.S., London and Moscow, according to his LinkedIn profile. At the time of his discussions with Broidy, he was the managing partner at Chadbourne\u2019s Moscow office.\nIn a telephone interview Tuesday from Moscow, Baev said an investment banker introduced him to Broidy in New York in the summer of 2016 during discussions about an unrelated transaction.\nTrump\u2019s election a few months later signaled a potential rapprochement with Russia. As the inauguration approached, several global law firms were exploring work they could do to help companies and individuals subject to U.S. sanctions, Baev said. Prompted by \u201ca possible instruction from one of my corporate clients,\u201d Baev said, he reached out to Broidy as well as another potential Washington consultant.\nBaev declined to identify the client and said he was never retained to pursue the matter.

Chadbourne has since become part of the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, where Lowell\u2019s clients now include Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law.\nDan McKenna, a spokesman for Lowell and Norton Rose, said in an email that Chadbourne didn\u2019t do any work to remove Russian companies from the U.S. sanctions list.\nRemoving a company or individual from the U.S. sanctions list is an interagency process designed to reduce political influence, said Erich Ferrari, a Washington lawyer specializing in sanctions.\n\n        \n        \u201cIt\u2019s absurd to think that someone\u2019s political connections could get a sanctioned person off the list,\u201d Ferrari said. \u201cOnce someone is sanctioned, they become politically toxic, and you don\u2019t find a lot of people in Washington who are willing to stick their neck out for a sanctioned party.\u201d\nThe purported drafts of the proposal viewed by Bloomberg contain a \u201croad map\u201d that includes meetings at the highest levels of the Trump administration and with lawmakers who oversee foreign affairs. Shown a copy of one version of the document, Broidy said some details about fees were inaccurate, but he didn\u2019t comment on the contents of the \u201croad map.\u201d\nBaev said the potential client ended up hiring another firm and senior management at Chadbourne wasn\u2019t supportive of the project.

The president agreed with a New York Times reporter's question about whether doing so would amount to crossing a \"red line.\"\nMueller apparently has decided to cross that line anyway. The Times reported on Thursday that Mueller's team has subpoenaed Trump's company, the Trump Organization, for records pertaining to a number of business deals -- including some related to Russia.\nQuickTake QA: Guide to the Trump-Russia Probe\n\n        \n        Trump and his lawyers have thrown down all sorts of gauntlets around Mueller's probe. They have argued for a tight deadline leading to its conclusion, negotiated for where, when and how the president might agree to an interview with investigators, and pointed to areas that they think are off limits.\nIt would appear that Mueller, with the full force of the law and subpoena power behind him, intends to proceed as he sees fit.\nMueller has already made it clear that he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to look at Trump's business transactions. My Bloomberg News colleagues reported last July -- just a day after Trump conversed with the Times about that red line -- that Mueller was expanding the scope of his investigation to Trump's commercial dealings.\nMueller's probe seems to be pursuing three primary questions. The first is whether Trump or his campaign worked with the Kremlin to tilt the 2016 election in Trump's favor. The second is whether Trump or his advisers obstructed justice to derail the federal investigation. The third involves the possibility of financial quid pro quos that Trump and his family members (especially his son-in-law, Jared Kushner) may have sought in exchange for public policy favors (like, for example, possibly lifting economic sanctions on Russia or shifting U.S. Ukraine policy).\nThe quid pro quo stuff is likely to be all about money ultimately, and that's why the Times's scoop on Thursday is significant. Mueller is venturing into the Trump Organization itself, the nexus of all of the president's business deals. He's collecting records from a company that's inseparable from the president himself. No major transactions have occurred at the Trump Organization without Trump\u2019s blessing, and his unwillingness and failure to separate himself from his company since entering the White House makes that reality even more apparent.\n\n        \n        The president's intersection with Russian money is also a potential powder keg. The Times said that Mueller is examining a 2015 proposal by a Trump business partner, Felix Sater, to Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to orchestrate a real estate deal in Moscow. Sater claimed that he could get Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, to buy into the transaction and that doing so could help the president win the election.\nSater is, as they say in the trade, a character. And Cohen's efforts to contact the Kremlin about that deal relied on using a publicly available email address in the Kremlin's press office. That's not exactly the work of sophisticates who have contacts in the highest reaches of Russia's government.\nCohen has handled some of Trump's most sensitive matters, including payoffs to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        And Sater is a career criminal with organized crime ties. Trump and his children worked closely with him on the launch of the Trump SoHo Hotel and other real estate projects in the U.S. long before he set himself on course for the White House.\nAs I noted in a series of columns in 2016 and 2017, some of the murkiest financial dealings with possible Russian ties that Trump engaged in may have taken place in New York, not Moscow.\nTrump has repeatedly called Mueller's investigation a \"witch hunt,\" and his lawyers have\u00a0said\u00a0that the last decade of Trump\u2019s tax returns (which the president has\u00a0declined to release) would show that he had no income or loans from Russian sources. Last year, Trump\u00a0told NBC\u00a0that he had no property or investments in Russia.\n\"I am not involved in Russia,\" he said.\nBut Trump's description of his dealings doesn't allow for the fact that national security problems and other quandaries might arise for the president if Russia is involved in him -- either through potentially compromising business transactions and relationships in the U.S., or because of funds that might have flowed into his wallet years ago.\nSater's company, the Bayrock Group, operated out of Trump Tower, just two floors beneath the Trump Organization's headquarters. A former partner of Sater at Bayrock claimed that the company was run as a money laundering operation. Bayrock also allegedly got some of its funding from Eastern Europe and from Iceland, and the company paid Trump to put his name on their projects.\nAlthough Bayrock eventually went dormant, Sater never left the Trump team. He tried to engineer a diplomatic overture to Ukraine in early 2017, an effort he reportedly undertook with Cohen and which he tried to present to Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. And, of course, there is the 2015 Moscow deal he pitched to Cohen that Mueller is now examining.\nI have some history with Sater. Trump sued me in 2006, alleging that my biography, \u201cTrumpNation,\u201d had misrepresented his business record and his wealth. Trump lost the suit in 2011; my lawyers deposed him and Sater during the litigation.\nSater's intersection with the Trump Organization -- and the subpoena that landed on the company's doorstep -- probably should be reminders to the president, his family, and their lawyers that Mueller is content to draw his own lines in his investigation.\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\nTo contact the author of this story:\n                Timothy L.

The internal divisions flared this week after Trump congratulated Putin on his recent re-election without first reviewing written guidance that he not do so, a person familiar with the matter said.\nTrump has meanwhile reshaped his national security staff. On Thursday, he announced he would replace McMaster, who favored a tougher public posture toward Putin, with John Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations who is a staunch conservative and military hawk. That move came just a week after the president fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who had also adopted a more confrontational stance toward Russia, and nominated Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, to replace him.\n\n        \n        Congress has pressured Trump to get tougher on Putin and passed legislation in August giving lawmakers the power to block the president from lifting punitive U.S. measures imposed after Russia\u2019s incursion into Ukraine. Substantively, Washington\u2019s policy toward Russia has become tougher in recent months, though Trump\u2019s critics say he has dragged his feet in responding to Putin\u2019s provocations.\nRelationship PriorityTrump has agreed to adopt increasingly tough policy stances on Russia.

Those who gather, bleary-eyed, in the meeting room\u00a0are a mix of women and men, old and young. They include politicians and activists, both professional and little-known, though their identities haven\u2019t been formally released. The one thing that unites them is\u00a0opposition to Theresa May\u2019s plan for Britain to make\u00a0a clean break from the European Union.\nTheir aim: engineer a new referendum so the British people can reconsider\u00a0Brexit before it\u2019s too late. \u201cI do not want to see Brexit happen. I think it will destroy the futures of the next generation in this country,\u201d says Chuka Umunna, the charismatic, 39-year-old member of Parliament who chairs the weekly gathering. \u201cBut it\u2018s not about what I think\u2014and shouting \u2018Stop Brexit\u2019 is not a political strategy. I want the people to get a vote.\u201d\nFor the first time, people in the anti-Brexit movement in the U.K. are getting organized. That\u2019s because, for the first time, they believe they can win. Ever since May lost her majority in Parliament after a catastrophic gamble on an early election last June, it\u2019s been clear that she is in a weak position to lead the country through withdrawal from the EU. For six months after her election failure, she held her ruling Conservative Party together and managed to navigate the first phase of Brexit negotiations, albeit only after agreeing to pay the other 27 member states a 40 billion-pound ($56.4 billion) divorce bill.\n\n        \n    \n\n    Then came her first defeat. On Dec. 13, 11 members of May\u2019s Tory party defied her orders and overturned the government\u2019s will in a key vote in Parliament. The rebels ensured that lawmakers will get a binding vote on whether to accept or reject May\u2019s final Brexit deal once negotiations with the EU end later this year. Put simply, this means that May must get an agreement that is good enough to please her own lawmakers, and that\u00a0she cannot simply impose her policy on the country.\nIt is this make-or-break vote\u00a0in Parliament\u2014which is likely to come around October this year\u2014that the Brexit resistance is now targeting. By lobbying legislators, they hope to block May\u2019s deal, bring about a new referendum, or perhaps\u00a0trigger a new national election. The pro-EU alliance that\u00a0Umunna chairs\u2014which includes\u00a0Brexit rebels in Parliament and thousands of activists around the country\u2014played a crucial role behind the scenes in inflicting the defeat on May.\nSpeaking in his exposed-wood and glass office overlooking the Palace of Westminster, Umunna\u00a0says\u00a0that campaigners across the country targeted different members of Parliament in the run-up to the December vote\u00a0to persuade them to back the rebellion. They got \u201can avalanche of emails and hundreds of visits\u201d\u00a0to their offices, he says.\u00a0\nIncreasingly, the public and politicians alike can see the dangers of Brexit\u00a0and are changing their attitude as the economic risks become clear, he says. A recent leak of government analysis showed how Brexit will reduce\u00a0growth by as much as 5 percentage points over 15 years\u00a0if there\u2019s a free-trade deal, or 8\u00a0points if there\u2019s no deal at all. The most-affected areas are likely to be some of those that voted heavily to leave the EU. \u201cIt terrified some people what it was saying was going to happen in their communities,\u201d Umunna says. \u201cIf it does happen, and they are still the members of Parliament, they won\u2019t be forgiven.\u201d\nChuka Umunna,\u00a0at Parliament.\nPhotographer: Felicity McCabe for Bloomberg Businessweek\nUmunna is always immaculately dressed, a slick media performer who briefly stood for the leadership of his Labour party in 2015, before what he called \u201cthe added level of pressure\u201d\u00a0prompted him to pull out of the race. (It was ultimately won by socialist firebrand Jeremy Corbyn). Until recently, he\u2019s been careful to keep quiet about the work of his Grassroots Coordinating Group, as the committee is unfashionably known. He won\u2019t say where or exactly when they meet, because he doesn\u2019t want the gatherings to be mobbed by photographers and reporters.\nAway from prying camera lenses, Umunna and his fellow Brexit rebels have been seeking\u00a0the help of European leaders for their mission. On Jan. 15, he joined senior members of the Conservative party, including Anna Soubry, a former business minister, and Dominic Grieve, who served as the U.K.\u2019s Tory attorney general (before masterminding May\u2019s December defeat), to visit the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator,\u00a0Michel Barnier, in Brussels. They\u2019ve met senior officials in other EU institutions, European foreign ministers, and ambassadors from the bloc\u2019s remaining 27 member states\u2014even the heads of foreign governments. Some involved privately confide that the access to senior EU politicians has been \u201cextraordinary.\u201d\u00a0\nThe high-level contact is paying off. While EU officials know they must tread lightly to avoid appearing to meddle in British affairs, they are privately feeding valuable intelligence on the unfolding negotiations to their British allies. On March 6, a day before the EU published its draft plan for the next phase of Brexit negotiations, Umunna\u00a0was\u00a0in his office, focusing on the future trade deal with the U.K.\u00a0He told\u00a0Bloomberg reporters something that not even the British government officially knew at that point: that the\u00a0EU would make clear in its document that its offer of a limited trade deal, with poor access for services such as banks, could be improved\u2014if May backs down on her own strict \u201cred lines.\u201d\nConservative Anna Soubry (left) and Labour\u2019s\u00a0Chuka Umunna,\u00a0members of Parliament\u00a0critical of Brexit, leave\u00a0BBC Broadcasting House in February.\nPhotographer: Vickie Flores/Alamy\nThe prime minister has laid down hard rules for the talks. She wants to leave the single market, the customs union, and the direct jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, as well as to end\u00a0the free migration of people. But Umunna\u2019s information proved accurate. When the bloc published its guidelines the following day, they said\u00a0that if May\u2019s position \u201cevolves\u201d and she backs down on these issues, the EU will be willing to consider making a better offer.\nThe EU\u2019s controversial gambit became known as the \u201cevolution clause.\u201d It was seen as an attempt to pry open divisions among U.K.\u00a0strategists, a temptation to water down May\u2019s hard-line stance. To some of the more paranoid anti-EU campaigners in the U.K., Umunna\u2019s prior knowledge of the clause will serve as evidence of an international conspiracy against Brexit.\n\n        \n    \n\n    May\u2019s\u00a0defeat in December was a turning point for politicians in Europe, too. For many EU officials in Brussels and European capitals, Brexit had seemed inevitable. Their only hope was to limit the damage that the split would do and try to find a way to plug the 10 billion-euro hole in the bloc\u2019s annual budget that the U.K.\u2019s exit will leave. All that changed after May lost the vote in Parliament. \u201cThey recognize that Theresa May does not necessarily have a mandate for her negotiating position,\u2019\u2019 Umunna says. \u201cThey are very aware that actually, she isn\u2019t in the driving seat of this. It is Parliament that will be in the driving seat.\u201d\nSince the start of the year, European leaders have lined up to tell Britain that it is free to change its mind. If May\u2014or a different prime minister\u2014were to write\u00a0to European Council President Donald Tusk to say Brexit is off, the EU would\u00a0welcome the country back into the club without hesitation, they say. While the EU continues to take the hardest line in the negotiations, officials have made clear privately that they will agree to pause the Brexit process to allow time for a new referendum, perhaps\u00a0even another election\u00a0if necessary, according to Umunna. \u201cIf a crisis is precipitated and there were a general election, or a new national poll, we would be granted the time to do that,\u201d he says.\nSix of the 10 groups that\u00a0send representatives to join Umunna\u2019s Wednesday morning coffee meetings have now moved into the same offices at Milbank Tower, a 10-minute walk from Parliament. This shared space\u2014along with the weekly gatherings\u2014makes it easier for the separate groups to brainstorm, decide on the best media lines to use, and coordinate their campaign strategy and activities. \u201cWe\u2019ve got six months to change the game and get a people\u2019s vote on the Brexit deal,\u201d says Eloise Todd, chief executive of Best for Britain, one of the groups in Umunna\u2019s weekly meeting. Partly because\u00a0it\u00a0accepts\u00a0large donations, including 400,000 pounds from billionaire investor George Soros, Best for Britain has found itself the target of right-wing newspapers that\u00a0campaigned for the U.K. to leave the EU.\nTodd reckons the press attacks backfired and fueled a surge of interest in\u2014and donations to\u2014her campaign. She puts the odds of engineering a new referendum at \u201c50/50.\u201d Her team has already trained 2,000 activists in street-campaigning techniques and aims to prepare an additional 1,000 by the end of April. Digital operations are also getting the funding and resources they will need for a massive \u201cRemain\u201d\u00a0campaign\u00a0designed to build support over the summer for a referendum on May\u2019s exit deal. Many in the movement believe that only a new public vote would have the political legitimacy to halt Brexit.\nThe public is warming to the idea of having the final say on the Brexit deal, says James McGrory, executive director of Open Britain. With more than 500,000 supporters, his is the largest group attending\u00a0Umunna's weekly meetings. \u201cThis is not a slam dunk, either with the public or Parliament,\u201d\u00a0McGrory says. \u201cPeople will holler and say, \u2018How dare you?\u2019\u00a0but what is absolutely critical is that the democratic argument is on our side.\u201d\nLabour MPs\u00a0Chuka Umunna\u00a0(forward, holding sign) and Harriet Harmon (to his immediate right, wearing blue) campaign to remain\u00a0 in the EU\u00a0in June 2016.\nPhotographer: Nicola Tree/Getty Images\nThe campaign against May's version of Brexit faces huge challenges. There is no clear evidence that a new referendum would deliver a different result. In order to bring about a second national vote\u2014against May\u2019s wishes\u2014Umunna and company will need to persuade enough Conservative politicians to defy their leader on an issue that could bring down her government. They must also convince the main opposition Labour Party to back their cause. At the moment, Corbyn does not support a new referendum, though he hasn't ruled it out in the future. Umunna believes that Labour\u2019s leadership\u00a0could be persuaded, \u201cparticularly if they\u00a0feel it can bring a general election closer.\u201d\nNevertheless, the first task for the campaign groups is to make more noise in the run-up to the Parliamentary vote on May\u2019s Brexit deal in October. \u201cThere is a weird silence that has befallen our country,\u201d says Todd. \u201cBusinesses have persuaded themselves that they are Brexiting\u00a0and they need to shore up their political capital. But it would be much better for businesses to speak truth to power.\u201d\nWhen it comes time for the fight, Umunna\u00a0is confident the pro-EU side will be ready. The disparate groups now working together have learned from the insurgent campaign that Brexit backers fought to take Britain out of the EU. \u201cThere is a role-reversal now,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are not the establishment any more.\u201d\nFollow @Brexit for all the latest news, and sign up to our daily Brexit Bulletin newsletter.", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Steven T.

To date, his approach has been to say as little as possible. But he needs to strike a complicated balance in light of Trump\u2019s popularity among Republican voters and his toxicity among Democrats and independents, who could help Democrats win the House in congressional elections later this year.\nLawmakers took some comfort in statements from Trump attorney Ty Cobb and White House officials that Trump wasn\u2019t planning to fire Mueller. But Trump continued to attack the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d and he hired Joseph diGenova, a former federal prosecutor who has said Trump is the victim of a \u201cbrazen plot\u201d by the FBI and the Justice Department. DiGenova also has repeatedly criticized the Trump appointee who oversees Mueller\u2019s probe, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\nUndermining MuellerBack in January, McConnell said he saw no need to pass proposed legislation to protect Mueller because he knew of no \u201cofficial\u201d White House effort to undermine him. That position is no longer tenable, some Democrats said.\n\u201cThe presumption of that response has now been exploded by both the president and his lawyers,\u201d said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, a senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.\nFor one thing, the White House was slow to try to defuse Trump\u2019s attacks on Mueller. It took more than 24 hours for Cobb to issue his statement saying Trump had no plans to fire the special counsel.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        For Newest Lawyer, Trump Picks Fierce Critic of Mueller\u2019s Probe\nDiGenova\u2019s addition to Trump\u2019s team is a signal that Trump\u2019s lawyers don\u2019t see the probe ending soon. It may also reflect growing dissatisfaction by Trump with his lawyers\u2019 be-patient assurances that he should let the Mueller probe take its course.\nCobb had said since the summer that the investigation wouldn\u2019t stretch beyond the end of 2017. Trump and his legal team have been cooperating with the Mueller probe so far and have been negotiating terms for Mueller to interview Trump.\n\n        \n        Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, perhaps Trump\u2019s most prominent Republican critic in the Senate, said he hoped his party\u2019s leaders would speak out for Mueller.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always felt, and a lot of my colleagues have said privately, that\u2019s the red line we can not cross,\u201d Flake said Monday. \u201cI hope that leadership stands up and is more forceful in saying, \u2018Don\u2019t go there.\u201d\u2019\nA senior Republican senator said Monday evening that legislation to protect the special counsel isn\u2019t necessary.\n\u2018Straight Shooter\u2019\u201cI know Mueller well and believe him to be a straight shooter, and I continue to believe that giving Mueller the time and support necessary to get to the bottom of things is in the best interest of all parties involved,\u201d Orrin Hatch of Utah said in a statement. \u201cMy conversations with the White House have led him me to believe legislation is not necessary at this point because I do not believe the president would take such a foolish action.\u201d\nBut Democratic Senator Ron Wyden said all lawmakers should speak out now.\n\u201cEvery single member of Congress should regard this particular moment as one of the most important in their period of public service, because this is a fundamental question of American values,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cAre we going to secure the rule of law, or in effect are we just going to, you know, let the politics of raw power and brute force make these decisions?\u201d\nLegislation SoughtThe attacks have alarmed a number of Senate Democrats, some of whom are pressing their colleagues not just for statements but also to back legislation.\nWhitehouse said the attacks on Mueller should prompt a markup in the Judiciary Committee on legislation to protect Mueller\u2019s job. Bipartisan bills requiring judicial oversight of any effort to fire a special counsel received a hearing on Sept. 26.\nThe Democratic sponsor of one of the bills, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, said he\u2019s going to press hard this week for action -- maybe even on the must-pass omnibus spending bill needed to keep the government open past Friday night.\nCan Trump Dismiss the Special Counsel? Not Exactly: QuickTake\nDemocratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware said he\u2019ll also push for a bipartisan statement warning of consequences if Trump fires Mueller, noting that the president previously said he wasn\u2019t about to oust Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, only to go ahead and fire him.\n\u201cClearly stating to the president what the consequences would be, how seriously we would take that, is something I\u2019m going to be working relentlessly on this week, and trying to find Republican partners willing to do that,\" Coons said.\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley has urged the proponents of the two bills aimed at preventing Mueller\u2019s dismissal without cause to negotiate a compromise, according to Grassley spokesman George Hartmann.\n\u201cIt appears that some recent progress has been made along these lines,\u201d Hartmann said, but he added that \u201cthe constitutionality of legislation that affects the executive\u2019s ability to appoint and remove members of the executive branch remains an important concern.\u201d\nThe lead sponsors of the bills are Republican Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, both of whom have reiterated their opposition to firing Mueller since Trump\u2019s new attacks over the weekend.\nNo Bills NeededThe No. 2 Senate Republican leader, John Cornyn of Texas, said he doesn\u2019t think lawmakers need to do anything yet because he doesn\u2019t believe Trump will act.\n\u201cObviously, legislation requires a presidential signature. I don\u2019t see the necessity of picking that fight right now,\u201d he said.\nWhile conceding Trump\u2019s attacks on Mueller aren\u2019t helpful, Cornyn said the message has been sent to the president many times, formally and informally, that he shouldn\u2019t fire Mueller.\nBut like most Republicans, he wouldn\u2019t name a specific consequence Trump would face if he went ahead and did it anyway.\nDemocrats aren\u2019t unanimous in their worries.\nDianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said she was heartened by seeing Republicans like House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy speaking out over the weekend against any effort to shut down the Mueller probe.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we need it,\" she said of the legislation to protect Mueller. \u201cI was listening to various comments even from Republicans like Trey Gowdy.

Trump is separately embroiled in a scandal involving a $130,000 payment to an adult film actress -- Stephanie Clifford, who performed under the name Stormy Daniels -- who alleges he\u2019s attempting to prevent her from discussing a sexual relationship she had with him in 2006. Her interview on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d is scheduled to air March 25.\nAlso on Tuesday, a former Playboy model who claims she had a 10-month affair with Trump starting in 2006 sued the company that owns the National Enquirer to void a 2016 contract requiring her not to talk about the encounter.\n\n        \n        Marc Kasowitz, who is representing Trump in the Zervos suit, and Gloria Allred, an attorney for Zervos, didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment on the ruling.\nTuesday\u2019s decision is likely to be appealed and will probably reach the state\u2019s highest court, and perhaps the U.S. Supreme Court, said Mezey. The judge\u2019s ruling cited the Supreme Court\u2019s 1997 decision in Paula Jones\u2019s lawsuit against Bill Clinton, which held that the president doesn\u2019t have immunity in federal lawsuits over purely private acts.\n\"This case seems to be turning on the very question that the Supreme Court left open in Clinton versus Jones, which is whether their same decision would apply in a state court case,\" Mezey said.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        Zervos said Trump injured her reputation by denying that he groped her and branding women who accused him of similar behavior as liars. The defamation claim stems from statements by the then-candidate following the release of the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" recording that featured him making crude comments about women.\nTrump Lashes Out at Accusers, Says Allegations Are All Lies\nTrump has called the lawsuit politically motivated, adding that Zervos can\u2019t hold him liable for engaging in political speech that\u2019s protected by the First Amendment. He has said she continued to attempt to contact him and seek employment even after he made the alleged unwanted sexual advances -- and only turned against him after he failed to accept an invitation to her restaurant.\nTrump had also argued that he\u2019s immune from lawsuits in state court, citing the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. He has cited the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Jones\u2019s lawsuit against Clinton, where the justices ruled her federal case could proceed. But the nation\u2019s highest court explicitly stated that it wasn\u2019t deciding if lawsuits in state court could proceed against a president.\n\"There is absolutely no authority for dismissing or staying a civil action related purely to unofficial conduct because defendant is president,\" Schecter said. \"Even after Clinton v. Jones, decided more than 20 years ago, Congress has not suspended proceedings against the president of the United States and there are no compelling reasons for delaying plaintiff\u2019s day in court here.\"\nIt might still take years for the case to be resolved. Both sides have the right to automatically appeal to a panel of judges in Manhattan, a process that can take months. And the parties can then ask the state\u2019s highest court in Albany to review the case, a challenge that could take as long as a year to complete.\nThe case is Zervos v.

Protesters are demanding protection from gun violence, including a ban on assault weapons such as the rifle used in Parkland, a prohibition on high-capacity magazines that let killers shoot long bursts without reloading, and more effective background checks for gun purchases.\n\n        \n        The student organizers raised more than $3 million through an online GoFundMe campaign and worked with Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for universal background checks and other gun control measures.

But they\u2019re small steps compared with the 1994 assault-weapons ban that lapsed in 2004. Congress seemed poised to act after the 2012 massacre of 20 six- and seven-year-olds and six staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, but the effort failed.\n\n        \n        The street protests and growing congressional attention mean gun control could loom large in the November midterm elections. Democrats have embraced the issue, while Republican congressional leaders and Trump haven\u2019t moved to adopt measures such as ending assault-weapon sales. At one point Trump said he backed comprehensive gun-control measures, but he backed off after meeting with the NRA\u2019s top lobbyist. The president also said he wanted to allow teachers and other staff members to be armed and trained to confront shooters.\nSaturday\u2019s march follows a nationwide student walkout over gun violence on March 14, the one-month mark since the Parkland killings. Another national walkout, organized by a different group of students, is planned for April 20, the 19th anniversary of the 1999 attack at Colorado\u2019s Columbine High School that killed 12 students and a teacher and left two dozen more injured.\n\u2014 With assistance by Laura Litvan", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Josh Eidelson", "body": "A week ago, thousands of public school teachers in West Virginia went out on strike, a rare but familiar union-organized action to protest low wages and rising health-care costs. Tuesday night, state union leaders and the Governor Jim Justice reached a deal, and the teachers were expected to be back at work on Thursday.\nThey didn\u2019t go.\nUnsatisfied with the resolution, they stayed on the picket line, mounting one of the country\u2019s biggest unauthorized \u201cwildcat\u201d strikes in decades. \u201cI think that teachers had just finally had enough,\u201d said striking English teacher Erica Rodeheaver.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        As uncommon as work stoppages have become in the U.S., big wildcat strikes like West Virginia\u2019s are almost unheard of. It arrives at a moment when organized labor, already in steep decline, is facing a new emergency: The Supreme Court heard arguments Monday in a case that\u2019s expected by June to end mandatory union fees for all government employees, an outcome that would slash unions\u2019 budgets and power.\nAgainst this backdrop, the strike in West Virginia, where unions lack both mandatory fees and formal collective bargaining rights, has become for some a beacon, an example of the type of disruptive activism that could keep the labor movement alive.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the most important thing going on in the labor movement in recent years,\u201d said Joe Burns, the director of bargaining for the Association of Flight Attendants. \u201cI think it presents a path forward for the labor movement: solidarity and strike action.\u201d\nWest Virginia teachers say several factors convinced them to take the risk of striking. In addition to rising health-care costs and unusually low pay -- the state\u2019s average teacher salary was $45,622 in 2016, about 22 percent below the national average -- they found safety in numbers. The state already has hundreds of teacher vacancies, made existing employees that much more valuable. And the lack of formal collective bargaining rights, along with the state legislature\u2019s years-long refusal to address their grievances, left them without much recourse.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst thing that could happen \u2013 they fire me and I have to go get a job that pays more money than this?\u201d said Catherine Pizzino, who\u2019s in her 29th year teaching math. The attitude of many teachers, she said, was \u201cyou\u2019re losing right now \u2013 you have nothing to lose.\u201d\n\n        \n        For some teachers, deciding to stay out on strike - despite a deal their union leaders reached that was supposed to get them back in the classroom \u2013 was easier than deciding to strike in the first place. Many doubted that the legislature would actually sign off on the governor\u2019s agreement to raise their pay by 5 percent, and they weren\u2019t happy that the deal created a task force to address escalating health costs in lieu of a concrete solution.\nSome said they also felt responsible to the teachers who planned to keep striking, because they wouldn\u2019t cross a picket line. \u201cEven though they said that we\u2019d go back on Thursday, nobody was ready to go at any school that I visited \u2013 and I visited a lot of schools,\u201d said history teacher and local union officer Greg Phillips.\nThis kind of workplace turbulence could become more common if the Supreme Court gets rid of mandatory fees, a decision that would make more of the country \u201cright-to-work.\u201d Many states legalized collective bargaining and mandatory fees in hopes of averting wildcat disruptions and securing \u201clabor peace,\u201d and they largely have.\nIf more moderate members decline to fund their unions, the remaining members could prove more eager for aggressive action. If unions can\u2019t get the state to guarantee they can collect fees from everyone they\u2019re representing, they could be more hesitant to give the state a guarantee that their members won\u2019t strike. And if some unions give up their right to represent non-members and reboot as \u201cmembers-only\u201d groups advocating just for those who pay dues, unions could end up in competition with one another, trying to outdo each other with more militant, demonstrative protests.\n\u201cWhat we could see is multiple organizations competing for membership and for shop floor leadership in these workplaces, and as a result making it harder for employers to settle controversies,\u201d said Shaun Richman, a former organizing director for the American Federation of Teachers. \u201cWest Virginia is a good example of what this could look like: you\u2019ll have competing unions, competing over who can take the bigger action.\u201d\nOn Thursday, Governor Justice told a crowd of teachers he was trying his best to reach a resolution. \u201cI\u2019m not king,\u201d he said from his SUV. \u201cI\u2019m doing what all I can possibly do.\u201d But while the 5 percent raise he proposed was passed by a supermajority in the state house Wednesday, it\u2019s having a harder time in the state senate, which referred it to the body\u2019s Finance committee.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in a state of limbo,\u201d said striking teacher Kristina Gore.

The internal divisions flared this week after Trump congratulated Putin on his recent re-election without first reviewing written guidance that he not do so, a person familiar with the matter said.\nTrump has meanwhile reshaped his national security staff. On Thursday, he announced he would replace McMaster, who favored a tougher public posture toward Putin, with John Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations who is a staunch conservative and military hawk. That move came just a week after the president fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who had also adopted a more confrontational stance toward Russia, and nominated Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, to replace him.\nCongress has pressured Trump to get tougher on Putin and passed legislation in August giving lawmakers the power to block the president from lifting punitive U.S. measures imposed after Russia\u2019s incursion into Ukraine. Substantively, Washington\u2019s policy toward Russia has become tougher in recent months, though Trump\u2019s critics say he has dragged his feet in responding to Putin\u2019s provocations.\nRelationship PriorityTrump has agreed to adopt increasingly tough policy stances on Russia.

Yet his command of the nation\u2019s 1.2 million active duty personnel makes him uniquely placed to steer Trump away from any rash decision to unleash the U.S. military.\nTrump stunned his own aides this month by reshaping his foreign policy team in a more hawkish bent ahead of a key decision on the Iran nuclear deal and a historic summit with North Korea\u2019s leader. With a tweet, he said he\u2019d replace Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Then Thursday he tapped former United Nations ambassador John Bolton to be his third national security adviser in 14 months, dismissing H.R.

He gets to run DoD and be a shadow secretary of state.\u201d\nMattis made rare public comments alongside Trump on Friday when the president announced his decision to sign a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill that earlier in the day he threatened to veto. Trump cited a $70 billion boost to the Pentagon budget as the overriding reason for him to sign the legislation, singling out a number of priority weapons projects that could now go forward.\n\u201cWe need to take care of our military,\u201d Trump said.\n\n        \n        Taking the microphone, the four-star general lauded Trump\u2019s decision to sign the funding bill by citing comments attributed to President George Washington in the 1790s, saying the support will help guarantee peace. \u201cWe in the military are humbled\u201d by the backing provided by the American people, he added.\n\n        \n        It\u2019s clear from their relationship that Mattis \u201cwon\u2019t be next\u201d to leave the administration, Eaglen said, even though his three predecessors at the Pentagon -- Ash Carter, Chuck Hagel and Leon Panetta -- each lasted two years or less in the job.\nSee a list of all the officials who have left the Trump White House\nMattis, who Trump introduced to the country more than a year ago using the general\u2019s \u201cMad Dog\u201d nickname, will still have to contend with the rise of Pompeo and Bolton. The two are widely viewed as more hardline conservatives who have openly championed the utility of regime change and pre-emptive strikes abroad.\nSo far, Mattis\u2019s term as defense secretary has been characterized by a low-profile approach seemingly designed to limit \u201cgotcha\u201d moments where he might be seen as openly contradicting his boss. He\u2019s held only two televised press conferences in the Pentagon briefing room -- one last April after a cruise missile attack on Syria and the other in May, directed by Trump, to tout progress against the Islamic State.\n\u2018Locked and Loaded\u2019But he has shown flashes of disagreement.\nIn a pep talk overseas last year, Mattis told U.S. soldiers to \u201chold the line\u201d until Americans respect each other again, a comment many analysts interpreted as a criticism of the rhetoric emerging from Washington.\nAfter Trump said in August that U.S. forces were \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to confront the North Korean regime, Mattis helped calm tensions by saying \u201cnothing\u2019s changed\u201d in U.S. force posture and continuing with a tour of the U.S. west coast. \u201cU.S. forces maintain their usual high state of readiness in their deployed positions,\u201d he said.\nAnd while Trump has repeatedly labeled the 2015 deal with Iran to curtail its nuclear program a \u201cdisaster,\u201d and threatened to tear the agreement up by mid-May, Mattis has been more cautious. He told the Senate Armed Services Committee in October that if the U.S. \u201ccan confirm that Iran is living by the agreement,\u201d he believed \u201cthis is something the president should consider staying with.\u201d\nModeration and BombastThat tightrope act between moderation and bombast seems to have worked so far. Trump referred to Mattis as \u201cour great military genius-slash-person\u201d in December. And the defense secretary earned a laudatory presidential tweet when he said it would be \u201cgame on\u201d if North Korea fires missiles at the U.S.\nIn at least one way, Mattis has had a simpler job than any of his counterparts did: he oversees a department whose success Trump holds paramount and whose budget he has long sought to increase.\nUnlike Tillerson, Mattis also seems to have earned the right to steer his department as he sees fit. On foreign policy, Trump once said \u201cI\u2019m the only one that matters.\u201d He\u2019s made no such claim when it comes to military issues, seeming to treat the military brass as a breed apart. Trump early on moved to give his generals in the field -- from Afghanistan to Syria -- more direct authority over combat decisions.\nPentagon-State AllianceThe question now is whether Mattis will find Bolton and Pompeo chipping away at his powers. Mattis had a strong alliance with Tillerson -- they frequently coordinated their positions -- in a partnership that was a break from past tensions between the heads of the Pentagon and the State Department.\nNow, however, he finds himself surrounded by Cabinet members and advisers who disagree with his worldview, experienced bureaucratic insiders who enjoy the rough-and-tumble of Washington politics. Mattis is a firm believer in the so-called rules-based international order, under which the U.S. pays for the bulk of institutions such as the United Nations and NATO as a way of ensuring stability and maintaining its influence.\nOf course, there\u2019s never any guarantees in the Trump White House. The president has frequently proven quick to sour on top aides whose views he disagrees with, with almost half of his key advisers leaving since he took office.\n\u201cMattis is now more isolated,\u201d said Byron Callan, a defense markets and politics analyst in Washington for Capital Alpha Partners LLC. \u201cHe had kindred spirits in Tillerson and McMaster.\u201d\nTwo-Year TenuresIf Mattis were to leave this year, he\u2019d be the fourth consecutive defense secretary to do so after serving less than 24 months. Panetta, asked by President Barack Obama to shift over from the Central Intelligence Agency to the Pentagon, served less than two years, from July 2011 to February 2013.\nHis successor, former Republican Senator Chuck Hagel, lasted a little longer -- from February 2013 to February 2015. Hagel was succeeded by his deputy, Carter, who filled the position until January 2017.\nThose who know Mattis say that he will play a more important role than ever now, with Iran deal decision looming and the president\u2019s planned meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un coming as soon as May.\n\n        \n        \u201cTrump is the decider and while he is a saber rattler I think he is very reluctant to get into conflicts that are dangerous with people who can shoot back,\u201d said James Jeffrey, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Studies who was previously ambassador in Iraq, where Mattis commanded the 1st Marine Division during the most recent war.\nJeffrey said he expects Mattis to resist any effort by Bolton to encourage another war. Even if he pushes, Jeffrey said, the Pentagon chief \u201cwon\u2019t loan him an army to carry it out.\u201d\n\u2014 With assistance by Toluse Olorunnipa, and Margaret Talev", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Andrew Mayeda", "body": "President Donald Trump is taking his boldest step to level the economic playing field with China, ordering sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods in a move that could escalate already tense trade relations between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.\nThe president will instruct U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to levy tariffs on about $50 billion in Chinese imports, a senior White House official said.

U.S. stocks fell sharply early Thursday amid worries that the U.S. action could provoke a stern response from China. Meanwhile, business groups representing companies ranging from Walmart Inc. to Amazon.com Inc. are warning U.S. tariffs could raise prices for consumers and sideswipe stock prices.\nFed WarningsEven central banks, which normally stay above the fray of trade spats, are weighing in. \u201cA number of participants reported about their conversations with business leaders around the country and reported that trade policy has become a concern,\u201d Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said this week, while cautioning that trade issues haven\u2019t changed the Fed\u2019s outlook.

It followed a seven-month investigation by USTR into allegations China violates U.S. intellectual property, under the seldom-used section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. The U.S. concluded China engages in a range of violations, including policies that force American companies to transfer technology and the accessing of trade secrets through hacking, said Eissenstat.\nTrump\u2019s actions represent a \u201cseismic shift from an era dating back to Nixon and Kissinger, where we had as a government viewed China in terms of economic engagement,\u201d White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told reporters on Thursday. \u201cThat process has failed.\u201d\n\u201cThe problem is that with the Chinese in this case, talk is not cheap.

The Trump administration is also increasingly signaling it will exclude allies such as the European Union and Brazil from tariffs on steel and aluminum that take effect Friday, suggesting the U.S. is more interested in raising pressure on China, the world\u2019s biggest producer of both commodities.\nChina WarningChina\u2019s Ministry of Commerce has cautioned against the U.S. taking measures \u201cdetrimental to both sides.\u201d The nation strongly opposes such unilateral and protectionist action, and will take \u201call necessary measures\u201d to firmly defend its interests, the ministry said in a statement on its website.\n\u201cIf Trump really signs the order, that is a declaration of trade war with China,\u201d said Wei Jianguo, former vice commerce minister and now an executive deputy director of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, a government-linked think tank.\nWhat Our Economists Say\n\u201c$50 billion in tariffs against China, if that is what the U.S. moves ahead with, is serious money. Even so, the impact on China\u2019s GDP would still be just a fraction of a percent off the growth rate,\u201d Tom Orlik, chief Asia economist for Bloomberg Economics, wrote in a note. \u201cThe greater risk comes to China\u2019s long-term development trajectory, if the rise of economic nationalism impedes their march up the value chain.\u201d\u201cChina is not afraid, nor will it dodge a trade war,\u201d Wei said. \u201cWe have plenty of measures to fight back, in areas of automobile imports, soybean, aircraft and chips. On the other hand, Trump should know that this is a very bad idea, and there will be no winner, and there will be no good outcome for both nations.\u201d\nChinese Premier Li Keqiang said this week that the nation will further open its economy, including the manufacturing sector, and pledged to lower import tariffs and cut taxes.

The revenue they\u2019ll raise won\u2019t come from China, but from the pockets of Americans who\u2019ll have to pay more for Chinese goods.\nImposing this tax requires a strong justification, or at least an intelligible rationale. The Trump administration offers neither. It\u2019s true that the U.S. has legitimate trade grievances with China, but there are much better ways of resolving them.\nThe White House says it will impose tariffs on $50 billion (or maybe $60 billion) of China\u2019s annual imports to the U.S. Not quite yet, though: Details will follow in 15 days, and there\u2019ll be 30 days for comments before any tariffs take effect. At the same time, the Treasury has been given 60 days to come up with new restrictions on investment by Chinese firms in the U.S.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        Maybe\u00a0Trump hopes these threats will lead China to make trade concessions and he will not need to actually put these tariffs in place. Conceivably, it could work out that way: Premier Li Keqiang said this week China will open its economy further, do more to protect intellectual property, and restrain its efforts to get foreign investors to transfer technology. If China follows through, that might be enough for Trump to declare victory and move on to his next adventure.\nThe danger is that Trump actually believes his own bombastic rhetoric about winning a trade war\u00a0-- that the time for talking is past, that China\u2019s promises are worthless, and that the administration will keep raising taxes on U.S. producers and consumers until the trade deficit with China is eliminated. That would be a lunatic growth-killing plan even if China didn\u2019t retaliate. If China did push back, and raised tariffs of its own against U.S. exports, the impact on both countries\u2019 growth would be worse.\nEven if it doesn\u2019t come to that, the other great cost of Trump\u2019s approach is the threat it poses to the rules-based system of liberal trade -- one designed and built over decades by none other than the U.S.\nThe president may be deluding himself that he can change China\u2019s behavior merely by bullying. A far better plan would be to bind an increasingly powerful China into this system as a matter of mutual advantage. This is a multilateral effort, involving the European Union and Japan, and it would be made more difficult by the unilateral rule-bending (or -breaking) that the Trump administration is proposing. How wise is it, really, to tell China, \u201cDo as you\u2019re told: Might is right\u201d?\nOn intellectual property and technology transfer, China is widely agreed to have done some rule-bending of its own. That does need to be addressed\u00a0-- and the existing system provides ways to do so. Oddly enough, the Trump administration acknowledges as much; it announced this week that the U.S. would launch a new case at the World Trade Organization on China\u2019s rules for licensing technology, and it has also relied on the expertise of CFIUS, the committee on foreign investment, to block deals on national-security grounds.\n\n        \n        Starting a trade war, however, is another matter entirely. That\u2019s a plan with a likelihood of high casualties for both sides. No one is arguing that Trump lacks the authority to prosecute such a war.

Trump must have known this, of course. But the president, a survivor to his core, had to find some novel way of explaining why he was trying to escape the clutches of an obstruction of justice investigation by obstructing justice. Trump's White House counsel, Donald McGahn, saw this overreach for exactly what it was and threatened to quit unless Trump backed down. And so Trump backed down, according to the Times.Let's not pretend, however, that the president will remain subdued for very long. All of this transpired last June. Since then, Mueller has indicted or secured guilty pleas from four former Trump insiders for a variety of crimes. He's conducting interviews with senior White House officials and a meeting with the president apparently is on the horizon. As the temperature of his investigation rises, expect the president to act out in increasingly volatile ways, and to stretch the boundaries of the law to counter Mueller's probe.What might that look like?Trump has the power to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the official overseeing Mueller's probe, if Rosenstein doesn't obey a request to fire Mueller. Trump could then tear through the Justice Department's senior ranks, firing people until he finds one who would comply with his demands.Although there's some debate among legal scholars about how much latitude the president\u00a0would have for such a\u00a0purge, Trump's previous maneuvering in this investigation suggests he believes he can do almost whatever he wants. That might explain why the Times report is surfacing now: Perhaps White House officials, perhaps even McGahn himself, are worried that the president is set again on toppling Mueller and they want to stop it (having the president safely tucked away in Switzerland and unable to counter-program probably helps).\n        \n        McGahn also has much on the line himself. Last January, he met with Sally Yates, the acting attorney general at the time, after she told him that Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had lied to the White House about his contacts with a Russian official. McGahn invited Yates back the next day and asked her why the Justice Department cared if White House officials were lying to one another. Yates said that it would possibly give the Russians leverage to blackmail Flynn. As it turned out, the White House knew for weeks that Flynn hadn't been truthful about his communications with Russia -- and neither McGahn nor Trump apparently felt concerned enough to force him out.If McGahn is now in Mueller's crosshairs, he might have decided that the simplest solution is to cooperate with the probe and turn over information in exchange for gentler treatment. In that scenario, McGahn becomes the source, directly or indirectly, of all kinds of interesting stuff for investigators and the media to ponder.As the White House gets rattled further, Trump will test how deeply Congress believes in and respects the rule of law. The U.S. legal system, whatever its imperfections, is a pillar of American life and liberty. Republicans and Democrats in Congress should remind themselves of that and prepare for the very real possibility that the president will try to fire the special counsel again\u00a0-- especially if Mueller's probe ensnares any of the Trumps, including the paterfamilias.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.To contact the author of this story:                Timothy L.

That's easy: He'd nod and keep clinging to his post.\nThe nation's top legal officer desperately wants to keep his job, and Trump has made clear that he\u2019s on thin ice. So it was no surprise last weekend when former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was fired as Trump demanded -- nevermind his fast-approaching retirement or the need to protect the independence of the Justice Department.\nThere may have been merit in taking some action against McCabe, a confidant of former FBI Director James Comey who was fired by the president. But that wasn\u2019t why Trump targeted him. Instead, he meant to kneecap the the probe and distract from his dealings with Russians.\u00a0\n\n        \n        \n        \n        Mueller's fate clearly is on the line. As the probe deepens, Trump is intensifying his public attacks, which may be more easily dismissed as mere posturing if not for last year\u2019s attempted firing of the special counsel. Trump only backed off when White House Counsel Donald McGahn threatened to resign.\nIn recent days, South Carolina\u00a0Senator\u00a0Lindsey Graham predicted impeachment proceedings if Trump followed through on the threats,\u00a0with Utah Senator Orrin Hatch calling it the \u201cstupidest thing\u201d Trump could do. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued stern warnings against interfering with the investigation. But few are backing legislation that might protect Mueller.\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is in charge of \u00a0the Russian inquiry, would probably resign, as might FBI Director Christopher Wray. It would be reminiscent of the infamous 1973 \"Saturday Night Massacre\" when President Nixon fired the Watergate special prosecutor, causing his attorney general and deputy attorney general to resign in protest.\nFew in Washington expect Sessions to follow that course if similar actions were taken today.\nThere is crucial context both in why Rosenstein\u00a0took charge of the Russian investigation and the reasons for firing McCabe.\n\n        \n        The choice of Rosenstein, a respected U.S. attorney, was a calculated one. Sessions wanted to \u00a0pursue his ideological agenda -- anti-immigration, tough on crime and right-wing appointments -- while Rosenstein focused on managing the department and bringing expertise to criminal prosecutions.\nBut those plans were thwarted when Sessions was caught misleading the Senate in his confirmation hearings on his dealings with the Russians during the Trump campaign. Under pressure, he had to recuse himself from the Trump-Russia investigation. He also vowed to recuse himself from any matters involving the Hillary Clinton campaign or the Clinton Foundation.\nThat left Rosenstein to run\u00a0the Russia investigation. When Trump fired the FBI director for pursuing the Russia investigation, Rosenstein tapped Mueller as special counsel. That infuriated Trump, who has spent months threatening to fire Sessions for allowing this to happen. So the attorney general has tried to accommodate the White House at every other potential flashpoint, including the McCabe dismissal.\n\n        \n        McCabe was fired by Sessions for authorizing a leak in 2016 on the investigation into the Clinton Foundation and foreign money. He was also accused of lacking candor when interviewed by investigators.\u00a0But Sessions has not made public any part of the inquiry by the\u00a0department's inspector general, Michael Horowitz. Known as a straight shooter, he recommended\u00a0McCabe's dismissal. McCabe countered that his firing was really about trying to discredit Comey and Mueller investigation. McCabe has already appeared as a witness.\nTo fire him for leaks seems specious. First, the actual leak to the Wall Street Journal, contrary to Trump's assertion, suggested how McCabe was intent on pursuing a real investigation into the Clinton Foundation.\nLeaks, including pertaining to criminal inquiries, are common with the FBI. If Sessions wants a full-scale leak inquiry, he could start with Rudy Guiliani's friends in the New York office of the FBI. Their leaks against Hillary Clinton in the closing weeks of the 2016 campaign were calculated for maximum electoral damage. I once asked Oscar Goodman, a famous mob lawyer and later mayor of Las Vegas, how he won acquittals for some bad guys. \"Easy,\" he replied, \"FBI abuse,\" including leaks.\nThe irony of Sessions firing McCabe over a lack of candor\u00a0was put on full display on Wednesday, when\u00a0ABC News reported\u00a0that McCabe authorized an inquiry into Sessions' lack of candor before Congress; it was later closed.\u00a0If McCabe lied to FBI investigators about a leak he authorized, that would be grounds for dismissal. He denies this. The attorney general should release the IG's findings on McCabe immediately. \u00a0\nBoth Trump and his outside attorney, John Dowd, seized on the McCabe firing as a reason to end the Mueller inquiry. The president's in-house attorney, Ty Cobb, then insisted the president had no intention of firing Mueller. Then Trump hired lawyer Joe diGenova, a right-wing hit man who has criticized Rosenstein, Wray and Mueller.\nNo one knows what to expect from Trump when he feels threatened. But few believe Sessions would follow the brave example set by another attorney general\u00a0during a similarly dangerous moment for our democracy.\u00a0\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\nTo contact the author of this story:\n                Albert R.

Craker, Doblin likes to say, is the perfect flag bearer for the cause of medical marijuana production\u2014not remotely controversial and thus the ideal partner in a long and frustrating effort to loosen the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s chokehold on cannabis research. There are no counterculture skeletons in Craker\u2019s closet; only dirty boots and botany books. He\u2019s never smoked pot in his life, nor has he tasted liquor. \u201cI have Coca-Cola every once in a while,\u201d says the quiet, white-haired Craker, from a rolling chair in his basement office at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, where he\u2019s served as a professor in the Stockbridge School of Agriculture since 1967, specializing in medicinal and aromatic plants. He and his students do things such as subject basil plants to high temperatures to study the effects of climate change on what plant people call the constituents, or active elements.\nCraker first applied for a license to grow marijuana for medicinal research in 2001, at the urging of Doblin, the founder and executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), a nonprofit that advocates for research on therapeutic uses for LSD, MDMA (aka Ecstasy), marijuana, and other psychedelic drugs. Doblin, who has a doctorate in public policy, makes no secret of his own prior drug use. He\u2019s been lobbying since the 1980s for federal approval for clinical research trials on various psychedelics, and he saw marijuana as both a promising potential medicine and an important front in the public-relations war. Since 1970 marijuana has been a DEA Schedule I substance, meaning that in the view of the federal government, it\u2019s as dangerous as LSD, heroin, and Ecstasy, and has \u201cno currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\u201d\nRick Doblin, relentless advocate.\nPhotographer: Jonathan Schoonover for Bloomberg Businessweek\nBy that definition, pot\u2014now legal for medicinal use by prescription in 29 states and for recreational use in eight\u2014is more dangerous and less efficacious in the federal government\u2019s estimation than cocaine, oxycodone, or methamphetamine, all of which are classified Schedule II. Scientists and physicians are free to apply to the Food and Drug Administration and DEA for trials on Schedule I substances, and there are labs with licenses to produce LSD and Ecstasy for that purpose, but anyone who seeks to do FDA-approved research with marijuana is forced to obtain the plants from a single source: Uncle Sam. Specifically, since 1968 the DEA has allowed only one facility to legally cultivate marijuana for research studies, on a 10-acre plot at the University of Mississippi, funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and managed by the Ole Miss School of Pharmacy.\nThe NIDA license, Doblin says, is a \u201cmonopoly\u201d on the supply and has starved legitimate research toward understanding cannabinoids, terpenes, and other constituents of marijuana that seem to quell pain, stimulate hunger, and perhaps even fight cancer. Twice in the late 1990s, Doblin provided funding, PR, and lobbying support for physicians who wanted to study marijuana\u2014one sought a treatment for AIDS-related wasting syndrome, the other wanted to see if it helped migraines\u2014and was so frustrated by the experience that he vowed to break the monopoly. That\u2019s what led him to Craker.\nIn June 2001, Craker filed an application for a license to cultivate \u201cresearch-grade\u201d marijuana at UMass, with the goal of staging FDA-approved studies. Six months later he was told his application had been lost. He reapplied in 2002 and then, after an additional two years of no action, sued the DEA, backed by MAPS. By this point, both U.S. senators from Massachusetts had publicly supported his application, and a federal court of appeals ordered the DEA to respond, which it finally did, denying the application in 2004.\n\n        \n    \n\n    Craker appealed that decision with backing from a powerful bench of allies, including 40 members of Congress, and finally, in February 2007, a DEA administrative law judge ruled that his application for a license should be granted. The decision was not binding, however; it was merely a recommendation to the DEA leadership. Almost two years later, in the last week of the Bush administration, the application was rejected. Craker threw up his hands. He firmly believed marijuana should be more widely grown and studied, but he\u2019d lost any hope that it would happen in his lifetime. And he had basil to attend to.\nThen, in August 2016, during the final months of the Obama presidency, the DEA reversed course. It announced that, for the first time in a half-century, it would grant new licenses.\nDoblin, who has seemingly endless supplies of optimism and enthusiasm, convinced the professor there was hope\u2014again. So Craker submitted paperwork, again, along with 25 other groups. The university\u2019s provost co-signed his application, and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D\u2013Mass.) wrote a letter to the DEA in support of his effort.\nHe\u2019s still waiting to hear back. \u201cI\u2019m never gonna get the license,\u201d Craker says.\nPessimism isn\u2019t surprising from a man who\u2019s been making a reasonable case for 17 years to no avail. Studies around the world have shown that marijuana has considerable promise as a medicine. Craker says he spoke late last year at a hospital in New Hampshire where certain cannabinoids were shown to facilitate healing in brain-damaged mice. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018If cannabinoids could do that, let\u2019s put them in medicines!\u2019\u200a\u201d He sighs. \u201cWe can\u2019t do the research.\u201d\nAnother sigh. \u201cI\u2019m naive about a lot about things,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it seems to me that we should be looking at cannabis. I mean, if it\u2019s going to kill people, let\u2019s know that and get rid of it. If it\u2019s going to help people, let\u2019s know that and expand on it.\u2009\u2026\u2009But there\u2019s just something wrong with the DEA. I don\u2019t know what else to say.\u2009\u2026\u2009Somehow, marijuana\u2019s got a bad name. And it\u2019s tough to let go of.\u201d\nCraker\u00a0looks over some of the plants used in studies in the agriculture department\u2019s greenhouse at UMass.\nPhotographer: Jonathan Schoonover for Bloomberg Businessweek\nBack in 1990, Ethan Russo was a practicing neurologist who\u2019d grown frustrated with his pharmaceutical options. \u201cIt occurred to me I was giving increasingly toxic drugs to my patients with less and less benefit,\u201d says Russo, now one of the world\u2019s leading experts and advocates for research in marijuana medicine. \u201cIt caused me to go back to a childhood interest in medicinal plants and see if there were alternatives.\u201d\nIn 1996, when California became the first state to allow the use of marijuana by prescription, Russo saw an opening. With the support of\u2014who else\u2014Doblin and MAPS, he wrote a protocol and prepared for what he hoped would be a formal clinical trial using cannabis to treat migraines. Obviously, he\u2019d need to use NIDA-supplied marijuana. You can\u2019t do research acceptable to the FDA with marijuana grown illegally, as is all marijuana not grown at Ole Miss.\nNIDA twice rejected his applications to use its pot, but then the FDA assumed oversight of what it calls \u201cinvestigational new drug\u201d applications, and Russo got his approval. In the eyes of the FDA, his study was promising enough to warrant a clinical trial. \u201cWith any other drug, I would have been able to begin work on the trial the next day,\u201d he says. But the use of cannabis, and only cannabis, required a second \u201cpublic health service review,\u201d according to a rule instituted in 1998 to, ostensibly, facilitate more research. In reality, it did the opposite. NIDA denied Russo access to its cannabis. \u201cDespite the fact that the FDA had approved it,\u201d he says.\nAround the world, cannabis research was a growing field. Russo began to write and publish on the subject, and in 1998 he was recruited as a consultant by a British startup, GW Pharmaceuticals Plc, founded by two physicians who\u2019d been granted a license to cultivate cannabis by the U.K. Home Office, which oversees, among other things, security and drug policy.\n\n        \n    \n\n    In 2003, Russo joined GW full time, serving as medical monitor of clinical trials for two drugs developed from marijuana that GW grew: Sativex, for pain caused by cancer, and Epidiolex, for the treatment of severe seizure disorders. Phase III trials for both drugs were conducted in multiple countries, including the U.S. (The FDA doesn\u2019t have a problem with drugs derived from legal pot. It\u2019s just that in the U.S., the only federally legal pot is from Ole Miss.) Sativex is now available in every country in which trials were conducted except the U.S., where GW expects approval soon. \u201cBasically, I had begun working for a foreign company because of the impossibility of doing clinical work with cannabis in the United States,\u201d Russo says. \u201cAnd here we had a situation where a medicine, made from cannabis, that was manufactured in England, was able to be imported and tested. It was legally impossible to do the same thing based in the U.S.\u201d GW has a market value of more than $2 billion and a robust drug development pipeline.\nDoblin\u2019s ultimate goal isn\u2019t to compete with GW Pharmaceuticals. Should the NIDA monopoly ever end, he says, a number of companies will surely want to grow marijuana \u201cto make extracts in nonsmoking delivery systems that can be patented\u201d\u2014that is, pharmaceuticals. This is a good thing, in his estimation. \u201cBut MAPS is focused on developing a low-cost generic plant in bud form,\u201d he says. In other words, he wants specific varieties of marijuana, not derivatives thereof, to be FDA-approved.\nMany people expect the Republican-controlled Congress to follow its recent tax overhaul by looking for ways to slash costs in Medicaid and Medicare. Legitimate research into the medicinal properties of marijuana could help. Studies show that opioid use drops significantly in states where marijuana has been legalized; this suggests people are consuming the plant for pain, something they could be doing more effectively if physicians and the FDA controlled chemical makeup and potency. A study published in July 2016 in Health Affairs showed that the use of prescription drugs for which marijuana could serve as a clinical alternative \u201cfell significantly,\u201d saving hundreds of millions of dollars among users of Medicare Part D.\n\u201cThe marijuana plant in bud form, if we can get it available by the FDA, is going to be incredibly cheap,\u201d Doblin says. His Israeli partners, Better by Cann Pharmaceuticals, can produce organic, high-potency trimmed marijuana for roughly 65\u00a2 a gram, or $18 or so per ounce. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about kicking people off of health insurance and reducing Medicare and Medicaid costs, we better find a way to provide medical relief to people at a low cost,\u201d he says.\n\n        \n    \n\n    Every year the percentage of Americans who favor legalization of marijuana climbs. Last year it topped 60 percent for the first time. A remarkable 94 percent support medical use. \u201cAnd businesses outside of the country are already making billions of dollars,\u201d Doblin says. Canada, the Netherlands, and Israel all have booming cannabis research sectors; in Israel, some of the work is government-funded. \u201cWe have enormous opportunity that we\u2019re squandering as a country to reduce health-care costs, build businesses, and create jobs,\u201d he says.\nRusso agrees. He now lives in Washington state consulting for several biotech startups working on cannabis projects. \u201cLet\u2019s face facts: This is a very technologically advanced nation with a great deal of talent. There is no way, shape, or form that the dangers of cannabis warrant this kind of control,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are issues. There are side effects. Anyone who tells you differently is simply inaccurate. However, the kinds of problems related to cannabis administration are totally controllable. And it is a much safer drug than many, if not most, pharmaceuticals that are currently being approved.\u201d\nHe\u2019d just returned from an industry conference in Medell\u00edn, Colombia. \u201cI think that there\u2019s a greater chance of significant clinical cannabis research coming out of Colombia in the coming years than there is in the U.S.,\u201d Russo says. \u201cWhy would people allow this loss of business in a situation where, clearly, Americans could be preeminent?\u201d\nAmong those who\u2019ve advised Craker is Tony Coulson, a former DEA agent who retired in 2010 and works as a consultant for companies developing drugs. Coulson was vehemently antimarijuana until his son, a combat soldier, came home from the Middle East with post-traumatic stress disorder and needed help. \u201cFor years I was of the belief that the science doesn\u2019t say that this is medicine,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when you get into this curious history, you find the science doesn\u2019t show it primarily because we\u2019re standing in the way. The NIDA monopoly prevents anyone from getting into further studies.\u201d\nCoulson blames the Obama administration for not acting sooner, creating a situation in which the decision on granting new growing licenses was passed down to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has publicly declared his belief in the dangers of marijuana. The NIDA monopoly is now his to change. \u201cSessions has a 1930s Reefer Madness view of the marijuana world,\u201d Coulson says. \u201cIt\u2019s not realistic, and it\u2019s not what rank-and-file DEA really are concerned about. DEA folks have moved beyond this.\u201d\n\u201cI guess I take a nationalist approach here,\u201d says Rick Kimball, a former investment banker who\u2019s raising money for a marijuana-related private equity fund and is a trustee for marijuana policy at the Brookings Institution. \u201cWe have a huge opportunity in the U.S.,\u201d he says, \u201cand we ought to get our act together.

Research into the chemical makeup of marijuana is still new, but there are at least 160 cannabinoids and as many as 500 terpenes and flavonoids in the plant, all of which can be separated out, mixed, and matched. CBN is thought to aid sleep. CBG may have anticancer potential. One Israeli researcher has synthesized 22 different versions of THC to treat specific neurological conditions. \u201cThere\u2019s reason to believe there\u2019s a cornucopia of medicines in there,\u201d Kimball says\u2014medicines that, in theory, are patentable.\nAt foreign labs, and even at state-licensed operations in Colorado and Washington, plant scientists are growing genetically modified varieties that optimize for certain properties. The majority of their work is focused on increasing potency for recreational use\u2014getting people high\u2014but these companies are learning how to cultivate and engineer plants using increasingly sophisticated methods.\nMeanwhile, Mahmoud ElSohly, director of the Marijuana Project at Ole Miss, is growing limited varieties, outdoors, while trying to keep undergrads from breaching his security. (At one point, students were caught using fly rods to cast over the fence and steal buds.) It took ElSohly three years to get DEA permission to grow a strain high in CBD, a nonpsychoactive cannabinoid thought to have many healthful properties. The key ingredient in GW Pharmaceutical\u2019s epilepsy drug, it may have promise as an anti-inflammatory and antipsychotic.\n\u201cI am the most restricted person in this country when it comes to production of cannabis and different varieties,\u201d ElSohly says. \u201cIn Colorado and Washington or any other state where people don\u2019t have to get any approval from anybody, they just do it. They have the freedom to experiment. I don\u2019t have that freedom. My hands are tied. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\nIt appears that none of the 25 applications to grow marijuana for purposes of medical research have gone anywhere. (The DEA won\u2019t comment on this or release the names of the applicants.) Craker has yet to get a single call or email about his methods or motivations. No agent has come to inspect his facility or ask questions about security.\nHe marvels at the power of bureaucratic inertia: \u201cThe federal government can be so stubborn. To me they\u2019ve closed their minds.\u201d Craker can\u2019t grow marijuana, but he does lecture about it in his plant medicine classes. \u201cI go through the scenario of what we\u2019ve tried to do,\u201d he says. Ultimately, he says, some of those students may have to do the work he\u2019s been wanting to do for 20 years. \u201cMy generation has passed, and we haven\u2019t made it.

For almost an hour, the ex-coal executive and ex-con reads off a teleprompter, doing his best impression of a political candidate. For a big man, Blankenship has a\u00a0surprisingly soft voice. His message\u00a0is anything but. He talks of his years of union-busting, the twin evils of illegal immigration and opioid addiction\u2014blaming the first for causing the second\u2014and the folly of environmental regulation.\nThroughout, he never strays far from the true target of his ire: Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. Blankenship blames Manchin not only for much of what\u2019s wrong with West Virginia, but also for helping put him behind bars.\u00a0\nSenator Joe Manchin.\nPhotographer: Alex Brandon/AP Photo\nIn 2016, the former hard-charging chief executive officer of Massey Energy Co. went to federal prison for conspiring to evade safety laws in the lead-up to the worst coal mine disaster in a generation\u2014a 2010 explosion at Upper Big Branch Mine that killed 29 miners. Manchin, the governor at the time, commissioned an independent probe that reached blistering conclusions about Blankenship\u2019s tight grip over Massey and did a lot to seal public opinion about his role in the disaster.\nYears later, as federal prosecutors zeroed in on Blankenship, Manchin, by then a senator, said on national TV that the ex-coal boss had \u201cblood on his hands.\u201d\nDuring his year in prison, Blankenship maintained his innocence, even issuing a press release blaming the federal government for the explosion and referring to himself as a political prisoner. The day he got out in May 2017, he began tweeting insults at Manchin, accusing him of lying about the causes of the explosion and challenging him to a debate. Manchin said he hoped Blankenship would disappear from the public eye. Instead, Blankenship declared his candidacy for Manchin\u2019s seat.\n\u201cDon Blankenship has entered this race because he has an ax to grind with Joe Manchin,\u201d says Mike Caputo, Democratic minority whip of the West Virginia House of Delegates. \u201cIt\u2019s more personal than politics.\u201d\n\n        \n    \n\n    Before he can face Manchin, Blankenship has to get through the Republican primary on May \u202f8. His two main challengers, Evan Jenkins, the congressman who represents the state\u2019s southern coalfields, and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, are more polished politicians than Blankenship. But it\u2019s not clear that this matters. Their early polling lead has withered in the face of Blankenship barnstorming the state and spending millions of his money. A survey commissioned in early March by Jenkins shows him just two points ahead of Blankenship, who a month ago was a distant third. That\u2019s now where Morrisey sits.\u00a0\nAll three are trying to align themselves with the Trump agenda\u2014a smart move in West Virginia, where Trump\u2019s 61\u202fpercent approval rating is the highest of any state. But Blankenship can lay a truer claim to the sort of positions that got Trump elected. That\u2019s because in many ways, Blankenship blazed the trail Trump rode to the presidency, having spent years railing against free trade and government over-reach in his role as the state\u2019s most powerful coal executive.\nTo understand Blankenship\u2019s appeal\u00a0is to understand the current conservative movement in rural America, and how, in the span of several years, West Virginia became one of the reddest states in the country after decades as a Democratic enclave. \u00a0Asked to describe his politics, Blankenship says simply: \u201cI don\u2019t believe in liberal causes because I think liberalism is too close to socialism, and that\u2019s been proven to fail around the world.\u201d\nFor generations of politicians, the key constituent force in West Virginia was the organized labor movement. No one wielded that power better than Robert Byrd, a New Deal Democrat whose 51-year tenure in the U.S. Senate is the longest ever. Today, Byrd is remembered as the masterful rainmaker who, as chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, steered billions of federal dollars into the state, as evidenced by the scores of roads, bridges, and buildings that bear his name. Upon Byrd\u2019s death in 2010, Manchin took over his seat\u00a0and then won it outright in 2012.\u00a0\nThe Upper Big Branch Miners Memorial in Whitesville, W. Va., is dedicated to 29 coal miners who died in a\u00a02010 explosion.\u00a0\nPhotographer: Andrew Lichtenstein/Getty Images\nBy the 1980s, labor was losing its clout around the country. Blankenship, then a fast-climbing accountant at Massey, did as much as anyone to speed its decline in West Virginia. When Massey refused to sign a new union contract in 1984, it kicked off a 15-month strike by the United Mine Workers of America. Blankenship led the effort to keep Massey mines open, bringing\u00a0in non-unionized workers and leading to spats of violence that left one non-union truck driver dead, and bullet holes in Blankenship\u2019s office walls and car. Ultimately, Massey won, delivering the first of many blows to West Virginia\u2019s union base.\nBlankenship eventually became CEO and\u00a0chairman of Massey. By the early 2000s, he began spending millions of his own money getting Republicans elected to state office, including $3\u202fmillion in 2004 to defeat a pro-labor state Supreme Court judge. His power peaked on Labor Day 2009, when, on the top of a mountain that had been leveled for coal mining, to a crowd of tens of thousands, Blankenship delivered a broadside against his many enemies: the federal government, environmentalists, and companies that send jobs overseas. Clad in an American flag hat and shirt, he gave a performance that in hindsight seems torn from the page of a Trump stump speech, right down to the phrase \u201cmaking America great\u201d and\u00a0invective\u00a0against government regulation. \u201cI know that the safety and health of coal miners is my most important job,\u201d Blankenship said. \u201cI don\u2019t need Washington politicians to tell me that, and neither do you.\u201d\nSeven months later, Upper Big Branch exploded.\nProtesters hold signs as Blankenship (front left) prepares to testify at a hearing in Washington on coal mining safety in May 2010.\nPhotographer: Alex Wong/Getty Images\nSoon, Blankenship was being hauled before Congressional committees and being held personally accountable by men he regarded as political foes.\u00a0That included Robert Byrd. In a particularly heated exchange\u00a0in May 2010, Byrd, then 92, sparred with Blankenship during a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. \u201cThis is a clear record of blatant disregard for the welfare and safety of Massey miners,\u201d Byrd said. \u201cShame!\u201d he called out at Blankenship. It was among the last public appearances by Byrd. He\u00a0was dead a month later.\nDespite the deaths associated with Upper Big Branch,\u00a0to a lot of West Virginians, Blankenship is more martyr than villain. Even in the state\u2019s southern coalfields, where the disaster ruined so many lives, many miners associate him with better economic times, when the state\u2019s coal production was three times higher than it is today. Though Massey was sold in\u202f2011, it\u2019s not uncommon to see people wearing old jackets and hats emblazoned with the company logo. On a February morning in Mingo County, miners coming off the overnight shift streamed into a small gas station convenience store, wearing their old Massey Energy jackets. Buying a hot sandwich before heading home to sleep, Terry Maynard, 46, acknowledges he doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019ll vote in November, but he isn\u2019t ruling out his old boss. \u201cEvery coal miner I\u2019ve talked to, you don\u2019t ever hear Don Blankenship get blamed for Upper Big Branch,\u201d he says. \u00a0\nThough he spent much of his career fighting\u00a0against\u00a0organized labor,\u00a0Blankenship has tapped into the anger of working people in West Virginia and their deep frustration over the state\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0stagnant economy. It\u2019s consistently at the bottom in terms of job creation, along with most other measures of prosperity. In 2016, it had the country\u2019s highest rate of drug overdose deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While these issues have long festered, the sense of exasperation has mounted in the past decade as the state\u2019s coal production fell by nearly half, pressured\u00a0by the slowdown of China\u2019s economy and also the rise of cheap natural gas from America\u2019s shale formations.\n\n        \n    \n\n    To feel the impact, you can zip down the Robert Byrd Freeway south of Charleston and drive to Mingo County, one of America\u2019s poorest regions and the childhood homd of Blankenship.\u00a0Near the highway exit to\u00a0the town of Williamson, population\u00a02,900, two giant signs hang\u00a0from the side of a building:\u00a0\u201cLEGALIZE COAL,\u201d says one. \u201cTRUMP,\u201d says the other.\nWhile he\u2019s popular with the base, Blankenship makes most establishment Republicans nervous, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who recently said he didn\u2019t want to see Blankenship as the GOP standard-bearer against Manchin. Blankenship\u2019s campaign staff practically delights in how uncomfortable they make such people. \u201cThe Mitch McConnells of the world will say, \u2018This is risky,\u2019\u201d says Greg Thomas, Blankenship\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cHe\u2019s been public in the past about this\u2014Don doesn\u2019t think Mitch McConnell should be in the Senate.\u201d\nManchin\u00a0may actually welcome Blankenship as his opponent. In an impromptu interview on Capitol Hill, Manchin chuckles when asked about\u00a0Blankenship\u2019s attempt to unseat him. \u201cHe\u2019ll have to join a crowd,\u201d he says. Although he\u2019s among the most endangered Senate Democrats up for reelection\u2014and the only West Virginia Democrat in Washington\u2014Manchin\u2019s prospects shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. He\u2019s out-raised the rest of the field, with $3.6 million by Dec.\u00a031. Manchin is also a natural campaigner, with a gift for shaking hands, kissing babies and remembering names. Voters feel as if they know him. Manchin\u00a0has been a politician for more than 35 years, going back to his time in the West Virginia House of Delegates in the early 1980s.\u00a0\nOver the years, Manchin has been able to morph into the kind of Democrat who can survive in a state that has gotten increasingly more red\u00a0during his time in office. He\u2019s distanced himself from the more progressive elements of the party and is culturally and politically attuned to West Virginia. In 2010, he famously ran an ad where he shot a version of Barack Obama\u2019s cap and trade bill with a rifle. Since Trump was elected, Manchin\u2019s been careful to focus on practical issues such as pension benefits for miners, rather than on political crusades such as immigration. That\u2019s at times drawn the ire of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate, which could end up being a plus.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that Manchin is an incumbent, and he will be hard to beat,\u201d says Bill Bissett, president of the Huntington\u00a0 Regional Chamber of Commerce.\u00a0\u201cBut at the same time, this is a volatile political climate, and it\u2019s going to be very interesting times in West Virginia.\u201d\u00a0\n\n        \n    \n\n    In recent years, Republicans took control of both branches of the state legislature for the first time since the Great Depression. The new GOP establishment is turning up the heat on Manchin. Billionaire Governor Jim Justice, himself a coal magnate from the state's southern coalfields, got elected in 2016 as a rare Democrat, then changed party affiliation last summer at a rally alongside a visiting Donald Trump. On March 14, after weeks of high-profile teacher strikes, Justice fired his Secretary of Education and the Arts\u2014Gayle Manchin, the senator's wife.\nWhile Justice acceded to the state's shifting political identity, Manchin is looking to tap West Virginia\u2019s once-dependable reservoir of Democratic support. Even today, 43\u00a0percent of the state\u2019s registered voters are Democrats, compared with just 32\u00a0percent Republicans.

Fleeing war-torn China for Hong Kong in 1940, Li found factory work while also caring for his ailing father, who soon died from tuberculosis. By the time he was a teenager, Li was working 16 hours a day at a plastics trading company.\nAfter the war, Li made his first fortune as a manufacturer of plastic flowers. His career as property mogul began in the late 1950s when, unable to renew his lease, he bought the site of his factory.\nPolitical ConnectionsIn the years to come, Li invested in local real estate as others sold, most notably in 1967, when riots inspired by Mao Zedong\u2019s Cultural Revolution in China rocked Hong Kong and sent property prices plunging.\nHis most symbolic coup as a businessman may have come in 1979, when he bought control of trading house Hutchison Whampoa from Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. Li quietly negotiated with the bank, now called HSBC Holdings Plc, to buy Hutchison shares for less than half their book value. HSBC agreed and Li became the first person of Chinese origin to own one of the British-founded companies that had dominated the local economy since the colony\u2019s founding in 1841.\nThat reputation helped Li make inroads in China, where he mixed extensive political connections with financial interests. Li was a senior adviser to the Chinese government on Britain\u2019s 1997 handover of Hong Kong and served on the committee that drafted the Basic Law, the city\u2019s mini-constitution under Chinese rule.\n16-Hour WorkdayClose Chinese ties had their downside too, particularly in the U.S., as critics including former President Ronald Reagan\u2019s defense secretary to ex-Republican Senate leader Trent Lott voiced concerns about Li\u2019s relationship with China -- allegations denied by Li\u2019s camp.

In his 80s, he made a small upgrade to a Citizen that cost around $400, he told Bloomberg in 2016, but even then chose something simple and durable.\nLi is no stranger to tragedy.

The question now is whether during the 2016 presidential campaign the NRA embraced a very different sort of international mission: serving as a conduit to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign for Russian interests.The Federal Bureau of Investigation is reportedly investigating whether the NRA helped funnel money from Russians into the election, which would violate U.S. election law prohibiting the use of foreign money. In recent years the NRA has developed relationships with several well-connected Russians, including Alexander Torshin, an ally of President Vladimir Putin who is deputy governor of the Russian central bank.Torshin, who has been implicated in money laundering by Spanish authorities, is also an NRA member. In 2016 he is reported to have met with Donald Trump Jr. at the NRA\u2019s annual meeting in Kentucky, and in 2015 NRA leaders met with Torshin in Moscow.\n        \n        \n        \n        The NRA has said that the FBI has not contacted it about Russian funds. Curiously, however, the gun group has so far failed to take the simple step of denying that it accepted Russian money at all. The NRA reported spending more than $55 million in the 2016 election, including $30 million on Trump\u00a0-- more than the organization has spent on any candidate in its history.Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee, has sent letters to the U.S. Treasury Department and to the NRA requesting information on the group\u2019s ties to Putin allies. Committee chairman Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, should do the same.The public has the right to know if the NRA served as a backdoor for Putin\u2019s sabotage of the election -- especially given the NRA\u2019s role in lobbying Congress and state governments, and funding political campaigns. Did the NRA receive any money from Russia-linked individuals or entities? Did it facilitate meetings between Russians and members of the Trump campaign? To what end?As a 501(c)(4) organization, the NRA is not required to disclose its donors. Congress should change that law. Regardless, thorough answers from the NRA to each of these questions could resolve any doubts about its conduct, even if they also show that the group chooses its friends poorly.Russia's sabotage of the 2016 election was an attack on American democracy. It should be easy enough for the NRA to show that it played no role in that assault.

Small said he would support an increase of at least $5,000 a year for each teacher, at a cost of about $246 million, which could be paid for by spending down a surplus while increasing the state\u2019s gross production tax on oil and natural gas.\nMany Oklahoma teachers aren\u2019t willing to wait and see what the legislature does. \u201cPeople are talking about \u2018strike\u2019\u00a0now\u00a0out in the open, and that\u2019s been a change,\u201d said John Waldron, a teacher and local union delegate. \u201cThe groundswell right now is pretty loud.\u201d Union leaders are hearing regularly from members who want to go on strike, and that pressure has helped force the leadership\u2019s hand, said Waldron, a Democratic candidate for the state legislature.

Instead, lawmakers last week passed a two-year government funding deal that would boost military and non-defense spending by $300 billion over the next two years and add more than $80 billion in disaster relief.But administration officials argue their proposals, dead on arrival though they may be, is still an important marker of the president\u2019s legislative priorities.Immigration Enforcement\n        \n        The plan includes a heavy emphasis on immigration enforcement. Trump is requesting $782 million to hire 2,750 new border and immigration officers, and $2.7 billion to detain people in the country illegally. Trump is also asking for $18 billion over the next two fiscal years toward the goal of constructing a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. That\u2019s a key point of contention in the ongoing legislative battle over the fate of young people, known as \u201cDreamers,\u201d who were brought to the country illegally as children.The proposal also includes $13 billion in new funding to combat the opioid epidemic, which Trump has frequently cited as among his top domestic priorities. The administration would provide a $3 billion boost to the Department of Health and Human Services in the next fiscal year, and $10 billion in 2019.The proposal takes \u201cmoney that the Democrats want to put to these social programs and move it to things like infrastructure, move it to things like opioid relief, move it to things that are in line with the president\u2019s priorities so that if it does get spent, at least it get spent to the right places,\u201d Mulvaney said Sunday during an appearance on Fox News.Boost for VeteransOther elements include $85.5 billion in discretionary funding for veterans health services, education, and vocational rehabilitation, the OMB said on Sunday. It is not clear how much of that funding would represent an increase from current spending levels.The budget also includes $200 billion in federal funds over the next decade that the White House says would spur $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending through partnerships with state and local governments and private developers. That includes $21 billion over the next two years that the White House says would \u201cjump start key elements of the infrastructure initiative.\u201dTrump will discuss the public works proposal on Monday with governors, mayors, state legislators and other officials, and he expects to meet with Congressional leaders from both parties at the White House on Feb. 14. The president plans to visit Orlando, Florida, on Feb. 16 for an infrastructure event, and he and cabinet members will also promote the plan at events around the U.S., officials said.The White House said its initial approach is to offset\u00a0the $200 billion in the budget for its infrastructure plan with spending cuts elsewhere, including from some transit and transportation programs the administration doesn\u2019t think have been spent effectively. But Trump is open to new sources of funding, a senior White House official told reporters.\u2018Robust\u2019 DefenseThe White House also didn\u2019t detail how much money it wanted to devote to new spending on the military, but OMB said the proposal would provide \u201cfor a robust and rebuilt national defense.\u201d In last year\u2019s budget proposal, Trump called for a $52.3 billion boost for the Defense Department, while asking for deep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency, State Department, and Department of Health and Human Services.Mulvaney said this year\u2019s documents -- theoretical though they may be -- would see those agencies targeted again for budget cuts.\u201cThere\u2019s still going to be the president\u2019s priorities as we seek to spend the money consistently with our priorities, not with the priorities that were reflected most by the Democrats in Congress,\u201d he told Fox News.\n        \n        \n        \n        Trump on Friday complained on Twitter that in order to boost military spending, \u201cwe were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want.\u201dThe budget proposal assumes that the U.S. economy will ramp up over the next decade to his goal of 3 percent growth, according to an administration official on Friday who confirmed figures to be contained in Monday\u2019s budget proposal.

Now there are concrete charges that Russians defrauded the U.S. government, with memos and other evidence to back up the allegations.Read more: Mueller Accuses Russians of Pro-Trump, Anti-Clinton Meddling\u201cIt\u2019s much harder for him to be able to impugn the integrity of sworn testimony in open court about the intention of the Russians to interfere in our elections,\u201d said Michael Allen, managing director of Beacon Global Strategies, a group that advises clients on international, cyber and homeland security policy.Trump seemed to recognize the changed landscape himself.\n        \n        In a tweet, he acknowledged a Russian \u201canti-U.S. campaign,\u201d and in the White House statement he called the country a \u201cbad actor.\u201d He has previously -- and frequently -- described allegations of Russian meddling in the election as \u201ca hoax.\u201dInvestigation ContinuesHis lawyers complimented Mueller in statements, though they used the past tense --\u201cdid\u201d -- to describe his work, suggesting optimism that the investigation has concluded.It has not. Rosenstein, at his news conference, said nothing about future indictments.Some even saw in the indictment new doubt about Trump\u2019s presidency.\n        \n        \n        \n        \u201cThe obvious conclusion is that Donald Trump\u2019s election as president can no longer be considered legitimate,\u201d said Anders Aslund, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who specializes in Russian economic policy.Rosenstein said the indictment does not allege \u201cthat the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.\u201dAslund predicted a \u201cdeep freeze\u201d on U.S.-Russian relations; none of the indicted Russians are in U.S. custody. Rosenstein said the U.S. would request their extradition.Allen, a former adviser to President George W. Bush and House Intelligence Committee Republicans, said the indictment makes it harder for Trump to challenge the FBI, Justice Department and intelligence community, and gives Rosenstein \u201csort of a bulletproof vest\u201d against being fired or undercut. Such moves now would look like punishment.Allen and others said that to avoid being weakened, Trump should immediately stop publicly doubting the Russian election meddling. \u201cIt\u2019s still not too late to pivot and say, \u2018No one is more upset about this than I am and here\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do about it,\u201d\u2019 Allen said.Trump\u2019s NarrativeBut Trump\u2019s political stature is entwined with the narrative he has built that Mueller\u2019s probe is a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d precipitated by Democrats.\u201cNo, Russia did not help me, that I can tell you,\u201d Trump told supporters at an Alabama political rally in September. \u201cAny Russians in the audience? I don\u2019t see too many Russians.\u201dHe\u2019s also repeatedly cited\u00a0personal assurances from Russian President Vladimir Putin in maintaining his skepticism.\u201cEvery time he sees me, he says, \u2018I didn\u2019t do that,\u201d\u2019 Trump said after a November meeting with Putin in Vietnam. \u201cAnd I believe -- I really believe -- that when he tells me that, he means it.

Federal prosecutors are investigating the business practices of RWC Group LLC, which owns Kalashnikov USA\u2019s plant in Pompano Beach, a person familiar with the investigation said.\nIt\u2019s unclear which business practices are under investigation, and a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Miami declined to confirm or deny any probe. Representatives for the company didn\u2019t respond to repeated requests for comment, but a top executive for RWC Group and Kalashnikov USA has said the manufacturer is doing nothing wrong.\n\n        \n        Nonetheless, the company\u2019s past links to Russia -- and its storied state arms maker Kalashnikov Concern JSC -- have drawn increasing scrutiny in the weeks since the Feb. 14 mass shooting at a high school in nearby Parkland, Florida. RWC Group became Kalashnikov\u2019s sole U.S. distributor in 2012, and the Russian company planned to sell 200,000 guns a year in America through that arrangement.\nBut in 2014, the U.S. Treasury imposed economic sanctions on Kalashnikov Concern and other Russian arms makers to punish Putin for supporting separatists in the Ukraine. RWC Group has said that since then, it has cut all ties to Russia and Kalashnikov Concern and is fully complying with the U.S. sanctions.\nTax-Break ApplicationBloomberg Businessweek reported this month that there\u2019s evidence that some ties persisted after sanctions were imposed. In an April 2015 application for $162,000 in tax incentives -- the subject of this week\u2019s federal subpoena -- Kalashnikov USA said it planned to assemble guns at its Pompano Beach plant from parts imported from Russia. (The tax breaks were approved in October 2015, but RWC never received them because it didn\u2019t deliver on commitments to create dozens of high-paying jobs.)\nIn addition, in December 2016, RWC Group said in court filings that it still had a license to make and sell Kalashnikov guns.\nThe sanctions ban any U.S. person or company from doing business with Kalashnikov Concern, so any ties between the Florida factory and the Russian arms maker could raise red flags with the U.S. Treasury, said Daniel Fried, a former U.S. Department of State diplomat who crafted Russia sanctions during the Obama administration.\n\n        \n        Executives for Kalashnikov USA have said generally in interviews and statements that their company isn\u2019t violating sanctions because it makes guns of its own design and doesn\u2019t source any parts from Russia.\n\u2018Museum\u2019 FactoryKalashnikov Concern sits at the crossroads of business and power in Russia. Putin once likened Kalashnikov\u2019s factory there to a \u201cmuseum of modern art.\u201d Last year, he presided over the unveiling of a 16-foot statute of the AK-47\u2019s late inventor, Mikhail Kalashnikov, near the Kremlin.\nKalashnikov Concern CEO Alexey Krivoruchko has the confidence of some of Putin\u2019s closest allies -- so much so that he has been allowed to buy 75 percent of the company from the Russian government since 2014. Krivoruchko has spent his career managing companies under Sergey Chemezov, a powerful Putin appointee who runs Rostec State Corp., a state conglomerate. Chemezov was personally targeted by same the U.S. sanctions that named Kalashnikov Concern.\n\"Krivoruchko is close to Chemezov, who right now is probably the most influential person next to president Putin,\" said Evgeny Minchenko, a Moscow political consultant who advises the Kremlin. \"Chemezov and Putin know each other since they both worked in Germany in the 1980s.\"\nKrivoruchko, who wasn\u2019t been personally sanctioned by the U.S., didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nInterlocking CompaniesKalashnikov Concern, the Russian company, has said that neither it nor its managers or shareholders, have any business relationship with Kalashnikov USA. But a closer look shows how interlocking companies, some of them set up since sanctions began, connect Kalashnikov USA executives to Krivoruchko.\nFor example, Michael Tiraturian is listed as senior vice president of Kalashnikov USA and as manager of its parent, RWC Group. He\u2019s a longtime business associate and friend of Krivoruchko. Tiraturian also is a manager of Florida companies that Krivoruchko created and used to buy a $2.4 million condo, a yacht and luxury cars in Miami over the last seven years.\nTiraturian also is listed as the manager of another Florida company, Solomon Asset Management LLC, which owns 65 percent of RWC Group, documents filed with the state of Florida show.\nTiraturian didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. In an interview earlier this month, Tiraturian said he\u2019s friends with Krivoruchko but denied any current business relationship.\nSince sanctions were put in place, in 2014, the two men don\u2019t even discuss business or Kalashnikov, Tiraturian said. Kalashnikov USA has spent years restructuring the company to comply with sanctions, severing all ties to Russia, he said. \u201cWe were very, very, very careful about what we do,\u201d said Tiraturian, who recently changed his name from Tiraturyan in corporate records. \u201cEverything we are doing is by the book, and clearly we are not doing anything wrong.\u201d\n\u2014 With assistance by Ilya Arkhipov", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jennifer Epstein", "body": "President Donald Trump directed the Justice Department to write regulations banning the use of accessories known as \u201cbump stocks\u201d that allow semiautomatic rifles to be fired more rapidly, and his press secretary declined to rule out supporting restrictions on the purchase of AR-15-style rifles like the one used in a Florida school shooting last week.\n\u201cI signed a memorandum directing the attorney general to propose regulations to ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns,\u201d Trump said on Tuesday at the White House. \u201cI expect that these critical regulations will be finalized, Jeff, very soon,\u201d he added, speaking to Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\nHe added that the government should focus on \u201cevidence-based solutions\u201d to gun violence.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        Asked if Trump would support renewing a federal assault weapons ban that expired more than a decade ago, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said at a briefing that \u201cwe haven\u2019t closed the door on any front.\u201d She also said it \u201chasn\u2019t yet been determined\u201d whether there should be a federal age limit for purchasing semiautomatic rifles like the one the Florida shooter bought as a teenager.\n\u201cBackground checks are something that the president is supportive of making more efficient and looking at better ways to improve that process,\u201d Sanders said.\nHer briefing was the White House\u2019s first since the attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which killed 17 people and reignited calls for stricter gun controls.

That question has grown more persistent thanks to successive indictments of Manafort by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, each documenting in finer detail Manafort\u2019s allegedly fraudulent scramble for cash just as he was taking the campaign job in spring 2016.\u00a0\n\u201cManafort looks like he\u2019s in dire straits,\u201d said\u00a0former federal prosecutor Peter Zeidenberg. \u201cThen he drops everything to work for free for Trump. It\u2019s very strange.\u201d\n\n        \n        \n        \n        Mueller now has a better view on the mystery.\u00a0Manafort\u2019s longtime business partner,\u00a0Rick Gates, pleaded guilty Feb. 23 to conspiracy and false statements. He\u2019s telling prosecutors about crimes he said he committed with Manafort.\nThe special counsel, who is investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 election, may seek to determine whether Manafort sought to benefit in some way from his unpaid work, Zeidenberg said.\u00a0\nManafort, who denies wrongdoing, will appear in court on Wednesday and Friday for arraignments on two new indictments unsealed last week by Mueller\u2019s prosecutors. They laid out how they said Manafort tried to hide the millions of dollars he made as a political consultant for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, and then came under increasing financial pressure after his Ukrainian work began to dry up.\nThat portrait is bolstered by previously unreported accounts of Manafort\u2019s work for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine -- including some as recently as six months before he took his job with Trump\u2019s campaign.\nManafort made 17 trips to Ukraine in 2014 and 2015, Ukrainian prosecutors who have records of his travel told Bloomberg. That work is more recent than the undisclosed lobbying activities Mueller has described in his indictments.\u00a0\n\n        \n        That later work wasn\u2019t as profitable as earlier efforts in Ukraine, largely because Manafort\u2019s top Ukrainian client, former President Viktor Yanukovych, had by then fled to Russia, other people familiar with the situation said. Manafort didn\u2019t get paid for some of the work he did on Ukrainian elections in late 2015, one of these people said.\nWhen Manafort is arraigned Wednesday in Washington, it will be his first time in court without Gates, who was indicted with him on Oct. 27. The Gates guilty plea prompted Manafort to say he hoped his longtime associate \u201cwould have had the strength to continue the battle to prove our innocence.\u201d\nNew AllyGates worked with Manafort for a decade in Ukraine, serving as a loyal wingman. In his guilty plea, Gates admitted that he helped Manafort set up dozens of undisclosed offshore bank accounts, hide their work as unregistered agents for Ukraine and launder millions of dollars into the U.S. Manafort convinced Gates to help him create false documents for banks, urged his son-in-law to lie to a bank appraiser and misled lenders about the use of loans, prosecutors charged.\nOne reason for Manafort\u2019s depleting cash flow was that the bulk of the work he did with Gates in Ukraine began to dry up when Yanukovych fled to Moscow after widespread popular protest in 2014.\nManafort returned to Ukraine just months after Yanukovych was toppled and Russia annexed Crimea, advising the former president\u2019s Party of Regions to rebrand itself as a catch-all party -- the Opposition Bloc -- that could be the voice of Russians in the east.\n\n        \n        Manafort was paid roughly $1 million for his work on the October 2014 parliamentary election, Nestor Shufrych, one of the Opposition Bloc\u2019s leaders told Bloomberg in April.\nManafort\u2019s last consulting assignment in Ukraine ended less than six months before he started working for the Trump campaign: He spent at least a month in Ukraine advising the Opposition Bloc ahead of local elections in October 2015, said the person familiar with the situation, adding that Manafort received payment for only part of that work.\nIn a 2016 bank loan application, Gates submitted a \"fake invoice\" on Manafort\u2019s behalf\u00a0to support a mortgage on his home in Bridgehampton, New York, according to the indictment. The falsified document said Manafort was owed $2.4 million for a \"consultancy agreement pertaining to parliamentary elections.\" The bank requested more information but later turned down the loan application, prosecutors said.\nUnpaid BillsManafort was still chasing unpaid bills from his Ukrainian work while he was chairman of Trump\u2019s campaign.\nIn July, with Trump closing in on the Republican Party\u2019s nomination, Manafort made a previously reported effort to patch his soured relationship with Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum magnate who is close to President Vladimir Putin.\u00a0\nManafort once did consulting work for Deripaska\u2019s businesses. The men had a falling out over $18.9 million that Deripaska invested with Manafort in a Ukrainian cable television venture in 2007. The venture failed, leading to litigation, including a lawsuit that Deripaska filed in January claiming Manafort and Gates defrauded him.\nIn an email to an intermediary, Manafort offered to give private briefings about the campaign to Deripaska.\u00a0\u201cI assume you have shown our friends my media coverage, right?\" Manafort wrote, according to an email obtained by the Atlantic. \u201cHow do we use to get whole?\"\nManafort wanted to meet in hopes of resolving the dispute over Deripaska\u2019s investment, according to two people familiar with the offer. The meeting never took place, they said.\nA spokeswoman for Deripaska has said he had \u201cno communications, meetings, briefings or other interactions with Mr. Manafort during, after, or in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.\u201d\nLarger Payoff?There are many explanations for why Manafort may have taken a job without pay, including a desire to gain a victory on a national stage to help reboot his consulting work. The indictment doesn\u2019t discuss any interactions with Russians or payoffs.\u00a0\n\u201cIf I were investigating the case, I would want to know whether or not he\u2019s expecting to get some kind of larger payoff from his Russian benefactors,\u201d said Zeidenberg, the former prosecutor.\nStarting around the time Manafort emailed the intermediary about the Deripaska meeting, he also got the first of two loans totaling $16 million, secured by his homes in Bridgehampton and Brooklyn, New York, from a bank not identified in the indictment. Descriptions of the loans match those extended by the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago. The bank is headed by Stephen Calk, who was part of Trump\u2019s economic advisory council during the campaign. Calk and the bank have declined to comment on client financial matters.\nIn all, Manafort defrauded banks of $20 million between 2015 and January 2017, the U.S. alleges.\nWhile Gates and other cooperators could lead Mueller into fresh avenues in its Russia inquiry, they may also help prosecutors flesh out their indelible portrait of Manafort\u2019s financial state. Former prosecutors say that Mueller\u2019s team already has the arc of its narrative, should the case go to trial.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a financial fraud case that sounds more desperate,\u201d said attorney\u00a0Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor. \u201cI\u2019m very confident that prosecutors will say in their opening statement this is a story about a man who was desperate to get this money to live the lifestyle he had and to get the money he had overseas.\u201d\n\u2014 With assistance by Daryna Krasnolutska", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Justin Sink", "body": "President Donald Trump defended his congratulatory call to Vladimir Putin on the Russian leader\u2019s re-election against criticism from some lawmakers that the election wasn\u2019t fair.\n\u201cThey are wrong!\u201d Trump said in a series of tweets Wednesday. \u201cGetting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing,\u201d he continued, \u201cThey can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming Arms Race.\u201d\n\n        \n            \n                I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also).

The GOP\u2019s gerrymandering in Pennsylvania in 2011 was overturned this year, thanks in part to help of a Democratic governor who took \u00a0office in 2015. The result? Three to five House seats this fall, Democrats say.\nBut they still are suffering from partisan lines in Ohio, Michigan and Florida. All three are purple; only a third of their combined 57 members of the House are Democrats.\nIn recent months, in part reflecting a national tide, Democrats have become more optimistic about contests in Ohio and Michigan.\nRichard Cordray, who clashed with Trump as the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is the party's preferred candidate in Ohio. He should be a strong general election candidate if he avoids getting beat up in the primary by left wing provocateur Dennis Kucinich, the former congressman. That probably would set up a rematch with Attorney General Mike DeWine, who narrowly won in 2010, in a climate friendlier to Republicans.\nIn Michigan, the political and labor union establishment has gotten behind Gretchen Whitmer, a former state legislative leader, one of many women this year riding the energy of the MeToo movement.

Now, as Special Counsel Robert Mueller bears down on Trump, Flynn is a key cooperating witness.\nA three-month Bloomberg investigation has found that Flynn, who was fired for having lied to the FBI and the vice president about his contacts with Russians, had a slew of other problematic entanglements. Previously unreported documents, including Pentagon contracts, emails and internal company papers, point to overlapping business conflicts around the world.\u00a0\nSelf-dealing is, in some ways, at the core of the Mueller inquiry, which is looking at money laundering, contact with foreign (especially Russian) officials and a blending of personal profit with public policy. During the campaign, the transition and his few weeks as national security adviser, Flynn was in Trump\u2019s inner circle. While it remains unclear what he\u2019s providing Mueller, his history of mingling business with government could point investigators to look for similar overlaps among other Trump insiders.\n\n        \n    \n\n    \u201cThese conflicts of interest and hidden deals are highly relevant to what was going on with the Russians,\u201d said Nick Akerman, a former Watergate prosecutor, noting that Flynn was in close touch with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak while also being close to Trump. \u201cHis hidden business entanglements\u00a0and his back channel communications with foreign governments raise a lot of possibilities.\u201d\nFlynn\u2019s troubles trace back to a previously unreported million-dollar contract for computer chips forged with a friend, Bijan Kian, a suave, Iranian-born businessman. A former governor at the Export-Import Bank, Kian was chairman of a Persian cultural nonprofit group, the Nowruz Commission, that gave him entree into high Washington circles. He built a relationship with former CIA Director James Woolsey and, in 2013, used it to get Flynn, then the Pentagon\u2019s top intelligence officer, to support his computer chip company\u2019s bid for a contract.\nThe next year, when Flynn was forced out by the Obama administration, his friendship with Kian blossomed into a business partnership. Kian brought him into the chip company, GreenZone Systems Inc., as a board member. According to Flynn\u2019s financial disclosure, GreenZone and its parent company paid him more than $150,000 in cash, plus an undisclosed amount of stock in 2015.\nKian also helped fund and found Flynn Intelligence Group, the ex-general\u2019s consulting firm, and served as a senior partner. While it\u2019s been known that Flynn was advocating in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Israel in 2015 for a consortium seeking to build several dozen nuclear power reactors, it\u2019s not been reported that he and Kian were also trying to sell GreenZone\u2019s secure chips as part of the deal. Flynn lied about the trip in his federal disclosures.\nKian also brought Flynn Intel its most problematic deal: a previously reported $530,000 contract with Dutch company Inovo BV, ostensibly to improve the business climate in Turkey. Flynn later admitted that the contract primarily benefited Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and that his firm had been paid to lobby U.S. officials to extradite an Erdogan enemy living in Pennsylvania.\nWhen he pleaded guilty in December, Flynn acknowledged that he had lied about the extent of his work for the Turkish government, though he was charged only with making false statements to federal agents about his contacts with Russia\u2019s ambassador.\nNeither Kian nor Flynn agreed to be interviewed for this story and their lawyers declined to comment. Kian has never spoken publicly about his business dealings with Flynn.\nNational Security Agency\u00a0Director Mike Rogers (left), Bijan Kian\u00a0(center) and Michael Flynn at a Nowruz Commission gala in 2014.\u00a0\nSource: Facebook\nAfter Trump\u2019s election victory, Flynn and Kian, both of whom served on the transition team\u2019s intelligence committee, worked on highly sensitive matters without disclosing that they had been paid to represent Turkey\u2019s government. Flynn also stopped a U.S. military plan to attack Islamic State in an offensive that would have armed the Kurds, Erdogan\u2019s avowed enemy, according to a Flynn confidant who said the decision was aimed at assessing previous policy.\nOnce Trump was sworn in, Flynn used his position as national security adviser to promote the Middle East nuclear deal that he and Kian had also pursued as a business opportunity for GreenZone. Documents released by a congressional oversight committee, citing the Wall Street Journal, show that Flynn, without disclosing his investment, ordered his staff to prepare a briefing memo urging the president to approve the plan.\nFlynn first met Kian in 2008, according to a disclosure Kian filed. There are photos of them socializing at the Nowruz Commission in 2011, and, by 2013, when Flynn was running the Defense Intelligence Agency, Kian came calling to pitch his computer chip.\nKian had tried for years to sell his chip to the government. White House logs show he was a frequent visitor, pushing the chip there in a 2012 meeting, according to a participant. The following February, Kian\u2019s fortunes changed when he got former CIA director Woolsey, a GreenZone board member, to help him land a meeting with Flynn. Flynn greeted the men at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, a military\u00a0base in Washington, and walked them to his office, a GreenZone colleague recalled. Woolsey declined to comment for this article.\nA slide from the presentation used to sell GreenZone Systems computer chips.\nKian spent nearly two hours extolling the benefits of his microchip that, once plugged into a smartphone, can mask the user\u2019s identity.\nFlynn was impressed.

The following year,\u00a0GreenZone was awarded a $1.1 million contract from the Pentagon\u2019s Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office, which works with, but doesn\u2019t report to, the DIA.\nIn the view of many ethicists, Flynn\u2019s actions challenged the spirit of Defense Department ethics guidelines but didn\u2019t violate their letter. The rules forbid former employees from accepting a job or compensation from a company within a year of helping it obtain a government contract worth at least $10 million. GreenZone\u2019s contract fell far below that threshold.\n\u201cThat\u2019s almost the classic revolving door problem in Washington,\u201d said Larry Noble, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan group that advocates adherence to campaign finance laws. \u201cWhen you move right to a company that you helped when you were in government, it raises the appearance of something untoward going on, even if there was none.\u201d\n\u201cThis new information indicates that General Flynn\u2019s use of public positions for profit was far more wide-ranging than previously known.\u201d\nKian also worked with Flynn Intel to drum up business around the globe. In October 2015, the two men traveled to Saudi Arabia, where they urged a utility company to hire GreenZone to design and install security systems around nuclear power plants the Saudis were said to be planning, according to company documents obtained by Bloomberg.\nWhen asked about that trip by Congress last June, Flynn said he had traveled with a friend to speak at a conference. He declined to name the friend, the speakers\u00a0bureau that represents Flynn has no record of a conference\u00a0and the hotel he told Congress he stayed at doesn\u2019t exist. Representative\u00a0Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House oversight committee, told Bloomberg that Flynn misled the FBI about the trip and gave false information about it on his security clearance form, both crimes.\n\u201cThis new information indicates that General Flynn\u2019s use of public positions for profit was far more wide-ranging than previously known,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cWe have been raising red flags and requesting documents about these issues for the past year, but the White House continues to stonewall us, and Republicans in Congress continue to wall off the White House from serious oversight.\u201d\nA year after the Saudi trip, in September 2016\u2014the height of the presidential campaign\u2014Kian\u00a0met with half a dozen staffers from the House Homeland Security Committee to promote GreenZone\u2019s secure communications products, saying their end-to-end encryption could protect communications by special forces in the battlefield. At the end of the meeting, Kian suggested a follow-up meeting for a live demonstration.\nAt that gathering, several weeks later at Flynn Intel\u2019s offices in Alexandria, Virginia, Kian was accompanied by Justin Freeh, a GreenZone board member and son of former FBI Director Louis Freeh. After 20 minutes of demonstrating the technology, Kian abruptly ushered in another group with an entirely separate and unexpected agenda. They talked about Fethullah Gulen, the Turkish cleric living legally in Pennsylvania and accused by Turkish President Erdogan of leading a coup attempt. The presenters called Gulen a terrorist and urged hearings about the danger he posed in hopes of getting him extradited. Kian was told the committee couldn\u2019t help.\u00a0Freeh didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nThat same month, Flynn and Kian met with Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican congressman from California who is supportive of Russia, to discuss the construction of up to 40 nuclear power plants across the Mideast in cooperation with Russia, a plan promoted by a consortium that included\u00a0former U.S. military men hoping to work with Flynn and GreenZone. Mueller\u2019s office has inquired about that meeting, according to lawyers involved in the case.\nFlynn arrives at the U.S. Courthouse in Washington on Dec. 1, 2017.\nPhotographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg\nThe previous month, when Flynn began receiving classified security briefings as part of the campaign staff, Kian brought in the $530,000 Turkish contract.\nWoolsey told the Wall Street Journal last year that Flynn and several Turkish government officials met in New York to discuss abducting Gulen and flying him to Turkey. Woolsey reported the plan to a friend who worked for Vice President Joe Biden, saying he considered it illegal, according to a former Biden aide.\nFlynn\u2019s lawyer, Robert Kelner, issued a statement last year denying that Flynn had ever considered detaining Gulen. An Inovo spokeswoman also said there wasn\u2019t any such plan.\nKian also played a crucial role, according to several people involved, in the preparation of an anti-Gulen op-ed article by Flynn that was published the day\u00a0Trump won the election and that has become a frequently cited part of the Turkish government\u2019s campaign against the cleric.\nIn his guilty plea in federal court, Flynn acknowledged lying to FBI agents when he denied that Turkish government officials had played a role in the article.\nFlynn helped Kian land a spot on the transition, where he prepared incoming CIA nominee Mike Pompeo for his confirmation hearing and pushed a number of policy proposals, including fighting a potential threat from electromagnetic pulses, or EMPs. Pompeo has recently been named secretary of state.\nAnother controversial and previously unreported proposal Flynn and Kian promoted was to hire private security contractors to collect information around the globe, then sidestep the CIA and provide the intelligence directly to the national security adviser, according to people who worked with them on the transition.\u00a0Flynn couldn\u2019t hold his administration job long enough to shepherd those plans into action.\nNine days after the inauguration, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates warned the administration that Flynn was susceptible to blackmail because he had lied to officials about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. Flynn resigned after 24 days. He\u2019s no longer on the GreenZone board.\nKian\u2019s standing in official Washington has evaporated. According to associates, he has been spending long stretches of time in California. GreenZone was sold.

But Trump already had made clear his growing impatience at the special counsel and his probe. In a series of posts, he criticized Mueller by name on Twitter for the first time, saying his investigation is corrupted by political bias.\n\u2018Hardened Democrats\u2019\u201cWhy does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans?

Dowd, who said he wasn\u2019t speaking on behalf of Trump, argued that the probe should end in light of \u201crecent revelations,\u2019\u2019 including the Friday night firing of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.\nTrump celebrated McCabe\u2019s dismissal, which he had called for, saying it showed evidence of a broad conspiracy against him.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        In his statement Saturday, Dowd said, \u201cI pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe\u2019s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier.\u2019\u2019\nRead more: Sessions Fires FBI\u2019s McCabe Right Before He Was to Retire\nAny move to oust Mueller would ignite a political firestorm in Washington.

The strongest Republican response to the attacks on the Mueller probe from Trump and his lawyer came from Graham, who repeated in a CNN interview his warning from last year that firing Mueller would be \u201cthe beginning of the end of his presidency.\u201d\nRyan\u2019s Standing PositionFew Republicans joined in.\nMost ducked the issue while at home over the weekend, though House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s spokeswoman, Ashlee Strong, reaffirmed his standing position that the probe should continue.\n\u201cAs the speaker has always said, Mr. Mueller and his team should be able to do their jobs,\u2019\u2019 she said Sunday in a statement.\nAiling GOP Senator John McCain defended Mueller on Twitter, praising his \u201chonesty and integrity\u201d and saying it\u2019s \u201ccritical\u201d the investigation continue \u201cunimpeded.\u201d\nOther Republicans appearing on Sunday talk shows also warned against firing Mueller, but, like Ryan, without saying what they\u2019d do if Trump acts.\nRepresentative Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight Committee and a member of the Intelligence Committee, dinged Dowd, the president\u2019s lawyer, for calling for the investigation to be shut down.\n\u201cIf you have an innocent client, Mr. Dowd, act like it,\u201d he said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\nBut asked what the House of Representatives, which has the power to bring articles of impeachment, would do if Trump fired Mueller, Gowdy said \u201cI\u2019m not sure the House can do a lot.\u201d\nLegislation StalledSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell didn\u2019t comment. The Kentucky Republican said in January he saw no need to act to protect Mueller because he knew of no official effort to undermine the probe. Without McConnell\u2019s backing, bipartisan legislation designed to protect Mueller from dismissal has far stalled so far in the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nDemocrats sounded the alarm and implored Republican colleagues to speak out.\n\u201cEvery member of Congress, Republican and Democrat needs to step up in defense of the Special Counsel. Now,\u201d tweeted Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.\n\u201cOur GOP colleagues, particularly the leadership, have an obligation to our country to stand up and make it clear that firing Mueller is a red line for our democracy that cannot be crossed,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.\nFiring Mueller would be a messy process in any case because Trump can\u2019t remove him directly. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller, has overseen the probe since Attorney General Sessions recused himself. If Trump ordered Rosenstein to fire Mueller and he refused, Trump could fire Rosenstein. That would put Solicitor General Noel Francisco in line to oversee the investigation -- and decide on Mueller\u2019s fate.\nThe probe appears to be focusing more directly on Trump himself.\nMueller recently gave Trump a list of avenues for questioning ahead of a possible interview with investigators, the New York Times reported.

The tax inquiry appears unrelated to other investigations that have since burst into public view.

Reports of sweeps and high-profile detentions are terrifying the state\u2019s undocumented population -- estimated at 2.6 million in 2015 -- who are scared to leave their homes.\nOngoing ShortageTheir absence threatens segments of the largest state economy, including retailers, restaurants and the Central Valley\u2019s $47 billion agricultural industry, which provides more than half of the fruits, nuts and vegetables in the country. That broad, 450-mile swath of California yields an eighth of the country\u2019s agricultural output.\n\n        \n        The farm industry is already struggling to find workers like Maria\u2019s husband. More than 55 percent of 762 farmers and ranchers surveyed in a California Farm Bureau Federation report from October 2017 said half of their land continues to go unattended because of an ongoing labor shortage directly related to U.S. immigration policy.\nOf the state\u2019s more than 2 million farm laborers, 1.5 million are undocumented, according to Tom Nassif, President of the Western Growers Association, a 92-year-old industry group representing farmers in California, Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico. Although Nassif and the association have supported Trump since the early days of his campaign, he says the raids and decades-old immigration policy for farm workers are harming the industry and state economy.\nWorkforce Protections\u201cWe know that a majority of our workers have presented false documents in order to gain employment, so (the raids) are always a concern to us, especially at a time when we have significant labor shortages and no hope that the federal government is going to pass legislation which allows us to have a legal workforce,\u201d Nassif said. \u201cWe\u2019re not so much married to a particular proposal.

The legislation would attempt to force all undocumented workers to return to their native countries and apply for visas. Only a fraction of those who apply would be allowed to return.\nIn effect, that would would be a prohibition on undocumented labor that would paralyze California\u2019s agriculture industry, said Nassif, which is already losing acres of labor-intensive crops, including cherries, apples, peppers and berries to farms in Mexico, South and Central America and East Asia. After setting records for revenue every year in the six years to 2015, receipts fell 13 percent to $47 billion in 2016 because of \u201cthe ongoing drought and shifting market conditions,\u201d according to Karen Ross, Secretary of California\u2019s Department of Food and Agriculture.\nThe most significant \u201cmarket condition\u201d is the labor shortage,\u00a0said Arturo Rodriguez, president of the United Farm Workers of America union, a problem that will get worse as long as Trump\u2019s ICE continues to target California.\nFor every employee who\u2019s detained -- from a farm, restaurant or California meatpacking plant -- dozens of others become fearful of returning to work. Employees across the state are quitting their jobs on the spot when informed that their employers have received federal audit forms requiring them to produce employee work authorization papers.

In the 1980s, he went broke. In 2008, during the financial crisis, he lost billions of dollars on Citigroup Inc. But nothing compares with the humiliation he sustained over the past few months. Last November, Alwaleed\u2019s uncle, King Salman, and his cousin, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, engineered a government roundup of alleged fraudsters, embezzlers, and money launderers that landed Alwaleed in Riyadh\u2019s now-infamous Ritz-Carlton hotel. He didn\u2019t leave for 83 days.\nI saw Alwaleed in late October, the week before he became a prisoner of the state. We spent an evening at his desert camp chatting about the financial markets and U.S. politics, watching a soccer match on TV, taking a walk through the sands, and eating a late dinner in the cool midnight air. Seven weeks after his release, in mid-March, I returned to the kingdom. Alwaleed had decided to break his silence and grant me an interview on Bloomberg Television.\nWe met informally the day before the interview at his palace in Riyadh. As I waited in the foyer, the prince descended the grand staircase from the second floor. He was dressed casually in a beige thobe, brown wool sports jacket, and sandals, and he struck me as relaxed. Over the next two hours, between sips of Arabic coffee and ginger tea, while his five granddaughters sang and danced to Katy Perry\u2019s Hot n Cold in the palace gym, he recounted his ordeal.\nIn the early hours of Nov. 4, Alwaleed, at his desert camp for the weekend, received a phone call summoning him to the royal court. He left at once, without any inkling he was walking into a trap. Soon government officials were leaking the sensational details of an anticorruption purge, with news reports pinpointing Alwaleed as the most prominent among hundreds of tycoons, government ministers, and other princes who were being detained at the Ritz-Carlton. Shares of his main company, Kingdom Holding Co., plummeted 21 percent in three days.\n\n        \n    \n\n    Alwaleed was quite the prize for a government eager to show its people that no Saudi was exempt from an ongoing crackdown on freeloading and graft: His\u00a0fortune of $17.1 billion places him 65th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. And his international profile\u2014forged through friendships and business partnerships with the likes of Bill Gates and Rupert Murdoch\u2014rivals that of Prince Mohammed. Kingdom Holding\u2019s portfolio includes Four Seasons Hotels  Resorts, Citigroup, Euro Disney, and Twitter. Rotana Group, which he controls separately, is the Arab world\u2019s largest entertainment company.\nThe government offered detainees a stark choice: pay up, sign an admission of guilt, and walk free\u2014or refuse and languish. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the price for Alwaleed\u2019s release was $6 billion. Negotiations were held in secret, and the government never disclosed any charges or produced any evidence. Critics said that due process was being denied and accused Prince Mohammed of conducting an intimidation campaign or simply a shakedown under the guise of fighting corruption.\nRumors of mistreatment and even torture at the Ritz-Carlton began to swirl, finding their way into reports by the Daily Mail Online and regional news media. So when the prince, still at the hotel, surfaced in a smartphone video in late January, after more than 2\u00bd months of confinement, appearing underfed and haggard, the speculation only intensified. He said he was being treated decently. No one believed it. (Others may not have fared as well. More recently the New York Times reported, citing anonymous sources, that some detainees were physically abused and otherwise coerced into confessions, and that one military officer in custody died bearing signs of a brutal beating.)\nSince his release, hours after the video was shot, Alwaleed has regained some weight, and he seems as energetic, intense, and engaged as ever. But in conversation it\u2019s clear he\u2019s struggling mightily with the experience. Even if he\u2019s innocent\u2014and he insists he is\u2014the government lumped him in with a group it cast largely as a bunch of crooks. And to complain about that or otherwise fall out of line is to invite a wrath he\u2019s witnessed all too closely.\nWe recorded the interview on a makeshift set in Alwaleed\u2019s apartment on the 67th floor of Riyadh\u2019s Kingdom Tower. Walking in, I wondered how candid he could be. Would he be forthcoming about life inside the Ritz-Carlton? If he\u2019d been harmed, would he admit it? Had he been forced to accept a devil\u2019s bargain to win his release? Would he be credible? What if the government had threatened him? Would I be able to tell?\nThe following is an excerpted version of our conversation, lightly edited for clarity.\nPrince Alwaleed\u00a0bin Talal in his penthouse office suite in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\nPhotographer: Guy Martin for Bloomberg Businessweek\nStarting with the obvious: WhyAlwaleed\u2019s detention was more mysterious than most. Of all the princes who were brought in, he alone hadn\u2019t served in the Saudi government, where kickbacks are considered common. And unlike other businessmen, he wasn\u2019t a government contractor and so couldn\u2019t have overbilled the state. He made most of his wealth transparently, in real estate and as an investor in public markets.\nErik Schatzker: Why were you arrested in the first place?\nPrince Alwaleed: Well, I would not use the word \u201carrested,\u201d because we were invited to the king\u2019s house and then asked to go to the Ritz-Carlton. So it was done with honor and dignity, and our prestige was maintained. Not only me; everybody else.\nSo the word \u201carrest\u201d is fair to use for those who did commit a crime, admit their guilt?\nExactly. And reached a settlement with the government. But in my case, you know, it\u2019s very much different.\nSo were there never any charges? Were you ever accused of anything?\nThere were no charges. Because I have a fiduciary responsibility to my shareholders in Kingdom Holding, to my friends in Saudi Arabia, and to the world community, because we have international investments all over the place, it\u2019s very important to say that there was zero accusation and zero guilt.\nYou\u2019ve described the whole ordeal as a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding over what?\nWhen I say misunderstanding, it\u2019s because I believe I shouldn\u2019t have been there. Now that I\u2019ve left, I would say that I\u2019ve been vindicated. Yet I have to acknowledge to you, for the first time, that yes, we do have with the government a confirmed understanding, going forward.\nWhat does that mean?\nIt is very confidential. I cannot get into that. But there is a confirmed understanding between the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and me personally.\nDoes that require you to do certain things? \nNot necessarily. I cannot get into that, because it is confidential and secret between me and the government. But rest assured that this does not really handcuff me.\nWhat did the government want from you?\nI will not get into the discussions that took place between me and representatives of the government.\nThey must have wanted something.\nI read what was written, that they wanted a chunk of A or B or C of what I have. This was all rumors.\nAccording to one report, it was $6 billion.\nI read $6 billion, I read more than that and less than that.\nDid it cost you anything to leave? Did you have to pay the government any money, did you have to hand over any land, did you have to surrender any shares?\nWhen I say it\u2019s a confidential and secret agreement, an arrangement based on a confirmed understanding between me and the government of Saudi Arabia, you have to respect that.\nI\u2019m a Saudi citizen. But I\u2019m also a member of the royal family. The king is my uncle. Mohammed bin Salman is my cousin. So my interest is in maintaining the relationship between us and keeping it unscratched.\nYou maintain your innocence. You say you didn\u2019t sign a settlement acknowledging guilt and that you\u2019re different.\nWe signed something, yes, a confirmed understanding. Some others may call it a settlement. I don\u2019t call it a settlement, because settlement to me is an acknowledgment you\u2019ve done something wrong.\nYou realize, of course, how important it is to be candid and honest with me about this, because the circle of knowledge is too wide. If a different story emerges, your credibility will suffer.\nSure.\nSo everything you\u2019ve told me is 100 percent true? \nI have a confirmed understanding with the government, and it\u2019s ongoing. I\u2019ll elaborate on that: It\u2019s an ongoing process with the government.\n\n        \n    \n\n    The matter of Alwaleed\u2019s reputationAlready, Kingdom Holding is talking to lenders about getting as much as $2 billion in debt financing\u2014\u201cfirepower,\u201d the prince says, for his next deal.\nThis whole ordeal has affected your reputation. People will still believe, no matter what you tell me, that because you were in the Ritz-Carlton you must be guilty of something. You must realize that.\nWhen you are detained, for sure some of the business community, some of the banking community will say they have doubts. That\u2019s my job right now, to interact, to meet with all of them individually or jointly and tell my story.\nI understand it\u2019s not going to be easy at all, because some banks and some people in the business community will be doubtful. They\u2019ll say, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d However, I assure them that everything is normal, everything is back to normal, and that we are functioning as we were before.\nIt would surely help if the government said, \u201cAlwaleed did nothing wrong, it was a misunderstanding, he paid nothing to leave, he remains a Saudi citizen in good standing.\u201d That hasn\u2019t happened.\nAll of these points were covered in the confirmed understanding, the agreement between me and the government.\nThe fact that I\u2019m speaking to you right now, and I\u2019m saying everything truthfully and honestly, and the fact the government is not going to say, \u201cAlwaleed is wrong,\u201d is an approval of what I\u2019m saying.\nSo you feel you need to speak out to, what, clear your name, because you\u2019ve been maligned?\nI need to clear my name, No.\u20091, and to clear up a lot of the lies. For example, when they said that I was tortured, I was sent to a prison, you know, during my 83 days in the Ritz-Carlton hotel. All these were lies. I stayed there the whole time. I was never tortured.\nThe games room at\u00a0Alwaleed\u2019s palace in Riyadh.\nPhotographer: Guy Martin for Bloomberg Businessweek\nInside the Ritz-CarltonAcross three months, 381 Saudis were hauled in and locked up at the Ritz-Carlton, which boasts 492 rooms, 52 acres of land, and 62,000 feet of conference space. Many left quickly. Alwaleed\u2019s stay was among the longest. The prince says he was kept in Room 628, a 4,575-square-foot royal suite.\nHow did you spend your time?\nA lot of sports, a lot of walking, a lot of meditation, a lot of watching news, a lot of praying.\nWhat was a typical day like?\nI would go to sleep at 6, 7 o\u2019clock [a.m.] and then wake up around noon. We prayed five times a day.\nYou had access to television, to newspapers?\nI had access to everything, everything.\nSo no one on the outside knew what was happening inside, but those of you on the inside knew everything about what was happening on the outside?\nExactly. That\u2019s why I was able to get information about this so-called torture.\nSo you were not harmed or mistreated in any way?\nNot one iota.\nYou\u2019re certain that nobody else who was at the Ritz-Carlton suffered anything akin to abuse, torture, wasn\u2019t even roughed up?\nMaybe someone tried to run away or do something crazy. Maybe he was put down and controlled. Maybe. But for sure there was nothing you could call systematic torturing.\nWere you allowed to talk to other detainees?\nNo. No two people in the Ritz-Carlton could talk to each other. Even in my case. I did not see anyone. I did not talk to anyone.\nYou were allowed to make some phone calls. To whom and under what conditions?\nI made my calls to my son, to my daughter and my granddaughters. And I talked to the heads of my companies, the CEO of Kingdom Holding, the head of my private office, and the secretary general of my foundation.\nWere those calls being monitored?\nMost likely, yes.\nAlwaleed\u00a0with his family at his Riyadh palace.\nPhotographer: Guy Martin for Bloomberg Businessweek\nDealing with the crown princeFor more than 70 years, the Saudi throne passed from one brother to another, but Salman broke with the past, first giving his son control over several government portfolios, then elevating him last year to crown prince. Prince Mohammed\u2019s plans include Vision 2030, an economic program that may see Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s largest oil company, go public. Movie theaters, banned since the early 1980s, are back, and in parts of Riyadh women walk without an abaya covering their heads. Starting in June, they\u2019ll be permitted to drive for the first time since 1990.\nWhat was it like being held captive by your own cousin?\nIt was not easy, I have to confess. It\u2019s not easy to be held against your will. But when I left, I had a very strange feeling. I gathered all the senior officers in my companies and all my close confidants and I told them, \u201cI swear to you I have complete serenity, complete comfort, and no grudge and no bad feelings at all.\u201d\nAnd sure enough, within 24 hours we were back in communication with the king\u2019s office, with the crown prince and his people. That\u2019s a very strange situation. But it\u2019s a fact.\nThat\u2019s because you simply had to move forward?\nNo. I\u2019m a nationalist. I\u2019m patriotic. I believe in my country. So I\u2019m not going to have this, this irritation that happened to me create a vendetta and turn me against my uncle, my cousin, my nation, and my people.\nHow would you describe your relationship with Prince Mohammed?\nIt\u2019s stronger. That\u2019s shocking to many people, even to my people.\nYou\u2019ve forgiven him?\nI\u2019ve forgotten and forgiven the whole process completely. It\u2019s behind me.\nHow often are you and he in contact?\nBarely three days go by without me texting or calling or talking to him.\nYou and he talk almost every three days?\nWe text a lot, but we talk less frequently. Barely a week goes without us communicating.\nPrince Mohammed has a grand plan for the transformation of the Saudi economy and Saudi society. Do you remain supportive?\nYes. His vision took a lot of my ideas, but he multiplied them. I had the sovereign wealth fund idea, I talked about Aramco going public. Women\u2019s rights, women competing in society, women driving, all of these things I called for.\nHe\u2019s establishing a new era in Saudi Arabia. Any person who does not support what Mohammed bin Salman is doing right now, I say, is a traitor.\n\n        \n    \n\n    Navigating the new Saudi ArabiaThe crown prince has also become the biggest Saudi investor, plowing tens of billions of state dollars into Uber Technologies Inc. and funds run by Blackstone Group and SoftBank\u00a0Group.\nDoes the government want you building and maintaining relationships with heads of state and CEOs of multinational companies?\nWhen I left, there were zero conditions on me, which means life as usual. I\u2019ve been in touch with many heads of states, in Europe and the Middle East. Everything\u2019s normal.\nCan you travel?\nSure I can.\nDo you know whether the government is monitoring your whereabouts?\nI\u2019m not worried about that.\nAnd your bank accounts?\nEverything\u2019s back to normal.\nYou\u2019re looking for foreign investments and so is the Public Investment Fund, Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund.\u00a0 Doesn\u2019t that put you in competition?\nActually, we\u2019re in touch with the government to be involved in many projects. They\u2019re going to have a big project in the Red Sea with Maldives-type resorts. Four Seasons was invited to be there. We\u2019ve also been invited to be part of another project in Riyadh, where there\u2019s going to be a huge entertainment center. You know, Disney-type.\nWe\u2019re in hotels, we\u2019re in media and in entertainment, so we\u2019re invited. So no, no competition, we complement each other.\nWhat about co-investment? Will the PIF invest together with Kingdom Holding, or perhaps Rotana, or Prince Alwaleed personally?\nYes, this will happen. We\u2019re in discussions right now with the PIF on certain projects.\nDomestic projects or international ventures?\nDomestically, to begin with.\nThe crown prince is touring the West. He\u2019s meeting President Trump at the White House, and he\u2019s trying to attract capital to Saudi Arabia. Given your experience at the Ritz-Carlton, how good can you feel about presenting a common front with the government, the very same government that put you in the hotel?\nI\u2019m supportive of Saudi Arabia, supportive of my government, supportive of King Salman and Prince Mohammed bin Salman all the way. Before, during, and after detention.\nPeople will find that hard to understand.\nThey don\u2019t understand that you\u2019re talking to a person who is a member of the royal family. We\u2019re all one party here. One party. The ruling family of Saudi Arabia.\nI understand it sounds weird to people. They\u2019ll say, \u201cYou\u2019ve been detained by the king and by the crown prince and you\u2019re still supporting them?\u201d You bet.\nYou have to wonder how comfortable CEOs will be investing in Saudi Arabia after seeing the Ritz-Carlton method of dealing with disputes.\nThey have to decide that.

McMaster as national security adviser, moving as the administration weighs tough actions against Russia and acting far sooner than many White House aides expected.\nMcMaster\u2019s departure had been the subject of intense speculation in recent days, yet most administration officials thought it wouldn\u2019t come for weeks. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said just a week ago that the two men had a great working relationship.\nBut Trump changed all that on Thursday evening, abruptly replacing McMaster with John Bolton, a former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and proponent of the 2003 Iraq War best known for his hawkish views.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        The move was announced by Trump on Twitter so quickly on Thursday afternoon that many of the president\u2019s top aides didn\u2019t know it was coming.\nEven by the standards of Trump, it was a turbulent day that left staff frustrated and demoralized. Earlier, the president rattled markets by imposing tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese imports, saw one of his top lawyers in the Russia probe quit in frustration and watched Congress struggle to try to avoid a government shutdown.\nThe ride isn\u2019t over: Sunday brings a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with porn actress Stormy Daniels, who is expected to say she slept with Trump just months after his wife Melania gave birth to their son in 2006.\nNorth KoreaThe McMaster move also means Trump is heading into talks with North Korea with a new national security team, having also just sacked his top diplomat, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Trump\u2019s tariffs meanwhile risk alienating one of the most important countries to the success of those talks, China -- which retaliated early Friday with $3 billion in levies on imports from the U.S.\nMcMaster\u2019s exit also comes as Trump faces tough decisions on whether to punish Russia for the attempted assassination of a former spy in the U.K. His security advisers discussed on Wednesday a list of options to present to the president, including fresh sanctions, closing consulates and expelling Russians from the U.S., according to two people familiar with the matter. Trump has been asking aides what allies -- including France and Germany -- are doing in response to the attack, conducted with what the U.K. says was a Soviet Union-designed nerve agent.\n\n        \n        Earlier this week, McMaster briefed Trump for a call with Vladimir Putin and didn\u2019t warn against offering congratulations on the Russian leader\u2019s election win, according to three people familiar with the matter.\nWritten guidance prepared for the president by White House advisers ahead of Tuesday\u2019s phone call explicitly cautioned against complimenting Putin. But in a verbal briefing he personally delivered to Trump before the call, McMaster didn\u2019t emphasize what not to say about the election, said the people, who discussed the matter on condition of anonymity.\nTrump likely didn\u2019t read the written guidance before speaking with his Russian counterpart, and he ended up offering good wishes to Putin on his re-election. That congratulatory message -- uttered as the U.S. considers a tougher stance toward Moscow -- prompted sharp criticism from senior Republican lawmakers and intensified tensions among White House aides involved in Russia matters.\nMcMaster\u2019s omission may not have made much difference. By the time the call was set up at Trump\u2019s request, two of the people said, most of the president\u2019s advisers widely believed their boss wanted to congratulate Putin and would have ignored any advice to the contrary.\nThe administration\u2019s stance toward Russian President Vladimir Putin had been the source of friction between McMaster and Trump. Last month, McMaster echoed the sentiments of top U.S. intelligence officials who told Congress that Russians are targeting the 2018 elections with potential cyber attacks and efforts to sow political division.\nTrump Conflict\u201cThe evidence is now really incontrovertible and available in the public domain, whereas in the past it was difficult to attribute,\u201d McMaster said on Feb. 17, after Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted a Russian \u201ctroll farm\u201d and its operators for an alleged covert social media campaign to influence the election.\nMcMaster called the Russian actions as described in the indictment a \u201csophisticated form of espionage.\u201d\nTrump rebuked him on Twitter, saying McMaster \u201cforgot\u201d to say that the results of the election weren\u2019t changed by the Russian meddling -- something the indictment didn\u2019t address -- and that the only collusion was between the Russians, Clinton and Democrats.\n\n        \n        During his 30-minute call with Putin Trump didn\u2019t mention such sensitive issues as the U.K. poisoning or ongoing concerns over Russian interference in U.S. elections. He conducted the conversation while alone in the White House residence, though some Trump aides were on the line. There has been some second-guessing in the White House that Trump was left without the proper staffing support at his side for this call.\nSenator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, assailed Trump\u2019s outreach to the Russian leader.\n\u201cAn American president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections,\u201d McCain said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cAnd by doing so with Vladimir Putin, President Trump insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election to determine their country\u2019s future.\u201d\nLater, the Washington Post reported that written guidance for Trump had advised him not to congratulate Putin.\nMcMaster, an Army lieutenant general, had been the focus of recent speculation that he would soon leave as Trump reshaped his foreign policy team. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly was said to be in consultations with Pentagon officials about finding a command that would have allowed McMaster to obtain a fourth star. In a statement released by the White House after his departure was announced, McMaster said he would retire from the military this summer.\nLater Thursday night, after Trump announced his replacement, McMaster attended a dinner for visiting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Washington and received a standing ovation after former Florida Governor Jeb Bush pointed him out in the crowd from the stage.\n\u2014 With assistance by Nick Wadhams", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Henry Meyer", "body": "Russian election observers denounced what they said were large-scale violations in the presidential vote that handed Vladimir Putin a crushing victory, including ballot-stuffing that was captured on state-controlled cameras.\nGolos, an election-monitoring organization, said it registered more than 1,500 violations in regions across Russia. Several cases of people stuffing ballot boxes at polling stations, including near Moscow, were recorded on cameras set up by the authorities to ensure a transparent vote.\nOpposition leader Alexey Navalny said data compiled by his observers at polling stations showed that the official turnout of 67.5 percent was inflated by 10 percentage points.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan has crushed peaceful protests at home and abroad, closed newspapers, threatened American soldiers, and collectively scapegoated Kurds. But over the weekend, Erdogan managed to go even lower.\nAt a rally at Kahramanmaras, the Turkish leader brought a trembling 6-year-old girl on stage dressed in military garb and told her she would be honored if she died as a martyr. He sounded like a terrorist. We expect this kind of child abuse from the fanatics in Hamas or Hezbollah. Erdogan though is the leader of an important NATO ally.\nTurkey is beginning to resemble Pakistan, a perpetually failing state whose military leadership has tolerated and advanced a vision of political Islam deeply hostile to U.S. and Western interests.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        To be sure, Turkey is not quite there yet. There is still a majority of Turks who want to eventually join the European Union. The Turkish economy is stronger than Pakistan's, and its banks are more trusted. And unlike in Pakistan, the driving force to further Islamize society has come from Erdogan, an elected leader, not the military. Indeed, the Turkish military has (until some of Erdogan's recent reforms) historically been a force that undermined the elected leadership through coups to preserve the secular tradition of modern Turkey's founder, Kemal Ataturk.\nThat said, Erdogan is following the Pakistani model in disturbing ways, according to Husain Haqqani, the former Pakistani ambassador to Washington. Haqqani, a former journalist, is in a unique position to evaluate this trend because he wrote the best history of how the Pakistani military embraced Islamic fundamentalism.\u00a0\nIn an interview Haqqani said Erdogan's approach was reminiscent of Pakistan's military dictator between 1978 and 1988, Zia ul-Haq. Like Zia, Erdogan has instituted legal and societal reforms to further Islamize society. In January, for example, he instituted a new plan to pour government money into Islamic schools.\n\"Erdogan has taken the Pakistani formula of mixing hard-line nationalism with religiosity,\" Haqqani said. \"Zia imposed Islamic laws by decree, amended the constitution, marginalized secular scholars and leaders, and created institutions for Islamization that have outlasted him. Erdogan is trying to do the same in Turkey.\"\nThe clearest parallel with Pakistan is Turkey's current approach to the war in Syria. In January, Erdogan launched a new offensive against America's Kurdish allies in Afrin. Even though the Turks have worked against the regime in Damascus, during the first weeks of that offensive they actually coordinated with their erstwhile adversaries in Syria.\n\n        \n        This is a less toxic version of Pakistan's broader approach to the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan. There, the Pakistani military and intelligence services have tolerated and at times encouraged a group known as the Haqqani Network (no relation to the ambassador) to become a lifeline for the Afghan Taliban and other terrorists attacking U.S. forces and the elected government in Kabul. At the same time, the Pakistanis have been important allies for the U.S. dating back to the Islamic insurgency against the Soviets in Afghanistan, and more recently against elements of al Qaeda since 2001. Of course when the U.S. finally tracked down Osama bin Laden, it found him living in the same town as Pakistan's prestigious military academy, Abbottabad.\nAgain, Turkey has not yet sunk to this level. But it's heading down this path. In the first years of the Syrian civil war after 2011, Turkey's border with that country was a sieve for new Islamic State recruits joining the short-lived caliphate in Raqqa. To this day, Turkey remains a friendly outpost for Hamas, the terror group that has run Gaza since 2007.\nAs a former U.S. ambassador to Turkey, Eric Edelman, told me this week: \"Turkey is not Pakistan yet, but if it continues on the trajectory that Erdogan has put it on, there is a prospect it could become like Pakistan.\"\u00a0\nThis is the deep challenge today for Washington. So far however the U.S. government has not shown Ankara the tough love necessary to stop Turkey's slide. The latest high-level visit for example, from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last month, sought to paper over Turkey's campaign in Afrin and Erdogan's recent threat to deliver an \"Ottoman slap\" to the U.S.\nThis kind of short-term thinking is understandable, but it doesn't address the slow-motion disaster happening now in Turkey. Here it's important, at the very least, to draw some boundaries for Erdogan and convey that he cannot maintain the current relationship with the U.S. if he crosses them. A good starting point would be to demand Erdogan stop threatening U.S. soldiers.\nIn the meantime, it's telling that Turkey and Pakistan are getting closer. Last week at a meeting of the Financial Action Task Force, the international body to counter money laundering, it was Turkey that helped counter a U.S. move to place Pakistani banks on a watch list for financing terrorism. Given the direction Turkey is heading, it looks like they are hoping Pakistan may one day return the favor.\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\nTo contact the author of this story:\n                Eli Lake     at elake1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:\n                Philip Gray     at philipgray@bloomberg.net", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jennifer Epstein", "body": "President Donald Trump plans to sign a spending bill that funds the federal government for the next six months, according to two people familiar with the matter, reversing a veto threat he made earlier Friday.\nTrump\u2019s turnabout came after a meeting with Defense Secretary James Mattis, who advocated for the bill\u2019s increases in defense spending and wanted the relative certainty of six months of assured funding.", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Josh Eidelson", "body": "Several Democratic congressional campaigns have agreed to bargain collectively with the Campaign Workers Guild, a new union trying to organize election campaign staff in what may be a first for national politics.The CWG announced Monday that it had secured a union contract with the campaign of Wisconsin activist Randy Bryce, the leading Democratic challenger to Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan in this year\u2019s mid-term elections.Campaign staffers are the latest professional targets for labor organizers.\u00a0While overall U.S. unionization remained at a record-low 10.7 percent, last year saw membership in the overwhelmingly non-union professional and technical services sector grow by close to 90,000 members,\u00a0bringing the total number of unionized American workers to 14.8 million, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\u00a0\n        \n        \n        \n        The CWG\u2019s effort is a first for congressional campaigns, which are staffed largely by contract and short-term workers operating in what are often high-pressure work environments.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that it\u2019s exploitative work,\u201d said Rutgers University labor studies professor Janice Fine, who\u2019s worked on local and national election campaigns. \u201cIt\u2019s premised on the idea that young people will work 24-7 in a selfless--and often dangerously selfless--way, and that culture has been passed on for generations.\u201dAmong the issues the union said it seeks to take on are hours that approach eighty per week and wages that are below $15 an hour.Under the agreement with Bryce\u2019s campaign, workers will get paid time off and earn at least $3,000 per month.

White House lawyers have said in the past they plan to cooperate fully with Mueller\u2019s probe, but Trump\u2019s other personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, has used his daily radio show to chip away at Mueller\u2019s investigation for months.\nThe show, which Sekulow has broadcast for more than two decades to an audience of more than 1.5 million daily listeners, has become a key venue for challenging the basis for Mueller\u2019s investigation. Sekulow has regularly attacked the credibility of McCabe and other FBI officials looking into Russian election meddling, as well as the use of a surveillance warrant against a Trump campaign adviser.\nDemocrats said they were alarmed by the latest attacks on the investigation.\n\n        \n        \u201cAny attempt by the president to obstruct or remove the special counsel would create a constitutional crisis and represent an attack on the core American principle that nobody, including the president of the United States, is above the law,\u201d warned Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware.\nThe president can\u2019t fire Mueller directly, since he answers to the Justice Department official who appointed him, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Usually a special counsel would report to the attorney general, but Sessions recused himself from the inquiry because he advised and supported Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. But Trump still has options.\nCan Trump Fire the Special Counsel? A QuickTake QA\nA series of potentially pivotal events are on the horizon for the investigation. Beyond a possible interview of the president, Mueller still hasn\u2019t had wide-ranging interviews with members of Trump\u2019s family who were witnesses to some of the issues he\u2019s investigating.\nWhile Mueller is believed to be nearing the end of his investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice, he may hold off on releasing any conclusion until other parts of his probe are settled, current and former officials said.\nMueller also appears to be looking into Trump\u2019s business, including asking witnesses about a proposed Trump Tower Moscow. The New York Times reported Mueller issued a subpoena for documents to the Trump Organization several weeks ago. Dowd had previously said it would be outside Mueller\u2019s mandate to probe into Trump\u2019s business dealings. He declined to comment on the subpoena.\nObstruction CaseGiven McCabe\u2019s role as an important witness with details about the firing of Comey, his termination could add to -- but not derail -- an obstruction of justice case, said William Yeomans, a 26-year Justice Department veteran who\u2019s served as an acting assistant attorney general.\n\u201cIf anybody had any doubts about the integrity of this process, they were put to rest by the president\u2019s tweet, which basically announced he had forced this, and it was a good thing that this long-serving FBI employee who had done some wonderful things during his career was going to be forced out two days before he qualified for his retirement,\u201d Yeomans said in an interview.\nSessions fired McCabe ahead of his planned retirement on Sunday at age 50, a move that Trump celebrated on Twitter as a \u201ca great day for Democracy.\u201d Sessions said he was responding to a report by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general and finding by the FBI\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility. Those offices found that McCabe hadn\u2019t been fully forthcoming with investigators in discussing his contacts with a reporter, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nMcCabe, who joined the FBI in 1996, became a Republican target partly because he helped oversee the investigation into Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s email practices in 2016, even though his wife had accepted donations from Democratic political organizations during a losing campaign for the Virginia state Senate the previous year.\n\u201cHow many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife\u2019s campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation?\u201d Trump said on Twitter. \u201cHow many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!\u201d\n\u2014 With assistance by Chris Strohm, and Toluse Olorunnipa", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jennifer Jacobs", "body": "Aides Urge Trump to Expel Russian Envoys Over U.K. Attack\n            \n            By  and \n            \n            \n                \n        \n            \n        \n        March 23, 2018, 7:47 PM EDT\n    \n        \n    \n                \n            \n\n            \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n                                \n    \n            President Donald Trump\u2019s advisers are poised to recommend that he expel some Russian diplomats from the U.S. in response to the nerve-agent poisoning of a former Russian spy living in the U.K., a person familiar with the matter said.\nThe advisers reached the preliminary recommendations at a National Security Council meeting on Wednesday and honed them on Friday in a gathering that included Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, according to two people familiar with the meeting.\nTrump has not made a decision and is unlikely to do so before next week, one of the people said.\n\n        \n        A battle within the White House over how to best address the provocations of Russian President Vladimir Putin has been intensifying. The internal divisions flared this week after Trump congratulated Putin on his recent re-election without first reviewing written guidance that he not do so, a person familiar with the matter said.\nTrump has been reshaping his national security staff. On Thursday, he announced the departure of National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, who favored a tougher public posture toward Putin, and announced that he would replace him with John Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations known for his hawkish views. That move came just a week after the president fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who also took a more combative stance toward Russia, and nominated Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, to replace him.\nTrump faces pressure to take a stronger stance against Putin from Congress, which passed legislation in August giving lawmakers the power to block the president from lifting punitive measures imposed after Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine. Substantively, Washington\u2019s policy toward Russia has become tougher in recent months, though Trump\u2019s critics say he has dragged his feet in responding to Putin\u2019s provocations.\nTrump, who\u2019s aware of the disagreement among his aides, didn\u2019t mention such sensitive issues as the U.K. poisoning or continuing concerns over Russian interference in American elections during a 30-minute call with Putin.\nRelationship PriorityTrump has been willing to adopt increasingly tough policy stances on Russia. But the president places a priority on maintaining a personal relationship with the Russian president, won\u2019t publicly attack him, and doesn\u2019t see any benefit to the U.S. in confronting Putin in one-on-one encounters, one administration official said.\nTrump defended his call with Putin on Twitter Wednesday, dismissing those who \u201cwanted me to excoriate him.\u201d \u201cThey are wrong!\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cGetting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.\u201d\n\n        \n        Regardless of the president\u2019s own rhetoric, his administration sees the Kremlin as a threat.\nA national defense strategy assembled by the Pentagon under Defense Secretary James Mattis and publicly summarized in January described China and Russia as the top global adversaries of the U.S. Last week, the administration slapped financial sanctions against a St. Petersburg-based internet \u201ctroll farm\u201d and its alleged owner -- a close Putin ally -- whom Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted over a covert social media campaign to influence the 2016 U.S. election.", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "David Voreacos", "body": "Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a former associate were indicted for a second time on new charges including failure to report income to tax authorities, in a move that could increase the pressure on them to cooperate with the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\nManafort and his former deputy, Rick Gates, were, accused in an October indictment of laundering millions of dollars earned while acting unregistered agents of the Ukrainian government.

A Democratic takeover of the Senate will be harder to achieve.\n\n\u201cWe are all very sensitive to the political environment we\u2019re in,\u201d said Oklahoma Representative Tom Cole, who led House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm in 2008. Republicans are girding for an \u201cextraordinarily competitive\u201d election.\n\nEven if only one chamber flips to the Democrats, Trump\u2019s ability to impose his agenda would be thwarted, and his administration almost certainly would find itself pinned down by investigations and subpoenas from congressional committees.\n\nAn analysis by Bloomberg Government of historical data, election maps and public polling points to sweeping Democratic gains in the November election, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate are on the ballot.\n\nSince the end of World War II, the party in control of the White House has, on average, had a net loss of 26 House seats in midterm elections. Democrats can win control of the House with a net gain of 24 seats in November. They\u2019d need to win two seats to gain a majority in the Senate.\n\nAdding to that, Trump\u2019s approval rating at this stage of his presidency, 36 percent, is lower than any of his predecessors going back to Harry Truman, according to Gallup polling data. The less popular the president, the more seats his party tends to lose.\n\nThat translates to \u201ca very poor chance of bucking the midterm odds if it holds at this level,\u201d Republican pollster Lance Tarrance wrote in a Jan. 5 analysis for Gallup. \u201cTrump\u2019s 20-point approval deficit in recent Gallup polling does not bode well for him, in part because none of the past five presidents saw an increase in their approval rating in the year before their first midterm.\u201d\n\nRepublicans do hold some cards. Those include favorable electoral maps drawn by Republican-dominated state governments after the last census. GOP candidates also should be able to run on solid U.S. economic growth, a 26 percent surge in the S&P 500 Index since Trump took office and an unemployment rate that stood at 4.1 percent at the end of the year.\n\nYet none of the good economic news has budged Trump\u2019s stubbornly low approval ratings so far, or what polls show is a sour public view of the direction of the country.\n\nIn that environment, Democratic candidates are swarming to run in Republican-held districts and drawing donors. Through the end of September, 145 House Democratic challengers to 73 Republicans raised at least $100,000, according to the Campaign Finance Institute. At a similar point in 2015, 35 Democratic challengers to 25 incumbent Republicans raised more than $100,000.\n\nRepublicans currently hold a 238-to-193 edge in the House, with four vacancies, and a 51-to-49 advantage in the Senate, but there\u2019s a lot of turnover in their ranks. There are 39 House Republicans who\u2019ve announced they\u2019ll retire or leave to run for another office, or have resigned for other reasons. Several of them are in districts won by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race. Among Democrats the number of departures is 16.\n\nThree Senate Republicans aren\u2019t running for re-election. Two of them, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee, publicly split with Trump and likely would have faced significant primary challenges from the party\u2019s right wing, highlighting some of the ideological splintering among Republicans.\n\nThe off-year and special elections conducted since Trump took office underscore the Republican challenges.\n\nDemocrats won governors\u2019 offices by wide margins in New Jersey and Virginia while also capturing Republican seats in both states\u2019 legislatures, as suburban voters shifted to Democratic candidates. In Alabama, Doug Jones became the first Democrat elected to the Senate from the state in 25 years in a race that featured a scandal-tarred and controversial Republican who divided his own party, even though he had Trump\u2019s endorsement.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s three pretty big canaries in the coal mine that ought to warn you that you\u2019re headed into a turbulent period in the next election,\u201d Cole said.\n\nAnother indicator comes up on March 13 in a special election for a House seat in southwestern Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump won the district by 20 percentage points and Democrats didn\u2019t field a candidate there in the last two elections. But the Republican Party is investing heavily to hang on to it. Trump paid an official visit there on Jan. 18, and both Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan are set to help the Republican candidate, Rick Saccone, raise money. If Saccone barely squeaks by, and certainly if Democrat Conor Lamb wins, it would be a shift of momentum that other campaigns will take seriously.\n\nDemocrats improved their showing in well-educated, historically Republican areas in the 2016 and 2017 elections, so some hard-fought races in the fall will be in the suburbs. Among the House districts that may be in play are those of Representatives Rodney Frelinghuysen and Leonard Lance in New Jersey, John Culberson in the Houston area, Barbara Comstock in the Virginia suburbs near Washington, and Peter Roskam in the Chicago area.\n\n\u201cI would not want to be an incumbent Republican member of Congress going into these midterms, especially in a suburban swing community,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a former deputy executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the political arm of House Democrats. \u201cIt is a toxic brew of typical midterm rejection of the party in power, combined with a historically unpopular president and a historically unpopular congressional agenda.\u201d\n\nLittle public polling is done for individual House races. But one indicator is the generic ballot preference question on national polls that asks voters whether they would prefer a Democratic or Republican candidate in their district. In the average of polls compiled by RealClearPolitics, Democrats have held a steady lead that\u2019s currently at 7.9 percentage points.\n\nLook for Republican candidates in competitive districts to emphasize local issues and legislative accomplishments for their home areas while also highlighting their independence from Trump, if he remains unpopular.\n\n\u201cYou need to have an identity that is different than just being a generic Republican congressman,\u201d Cole said.\n\nTargets for Democrats include the 23 districts that voted in 2016 for Clinton and for a House Republican. Seven are in California. There are another 12 Republican-held districts that Trump won but had voted to re-elect Democratic President Barack Obama in 2012. Seven of those are in New York and New Jersey.\n\nRepublicans have far fewer opportunities on offense and will look to offset expected losses by targeting some of the 12 districts that voted for Trump and a House Democrat in 2016.\n\nIn the Senate, where one-third of members come up for election every two years, Republicans may cling to their majority only by the good fortune of a friendly map.\n\nDemocrats have 26 of their seats on the line in November compared to just eight for Republicans\u2014one of the most politically skewed Senate-election maps in history.\n\nTen of the 26 Democrats are from states Trump won in 2016. Five are defending seats in states the president won by at least 18 percentage points. They include Senators Joe Manchin in West Virginia, whose Republican opponents include Representative Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey; Claire McCaskill of Missouri, challenged by state Attorney General Josh Hawley; and Indiana\u2019s Joe Donnelly, who likely will face either Luke Messer or Todd Rokita, both House members.\n\nDemocrats are seeking to unseat Dean Heller in Nevada, the only state Trump lost in 2016 where a Republican is defending a Senate seat. Democratic Representative Jacky Rosen is opposing Heller, who also faces a primary challenge from Danny Tarkanian, a businessman and frequent candidate.\n\nThe Democrats are also making a serious takeover bid in Arizona, where Flake is eschewing a re-election bid in a state Trump won by 3.5 percentage points. The likely Democratic nominee is Representative Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nDemocrats face longer odds but have credible candidates in the more heavily Republican states of Texas, where Ted Cruz is seeking a second term, and Tennessee, where Corker is retiring.\n\nFor all of their challenges, House Republicans can cling to a few mitigating forces that could give them hope of holding off a Democratic wave.\n\nKey among them are structural advantages in the electoral map.\n\nRepublicans dominated state-level elections in 2010, giving them the upper hand when congressional districts were redrawn after the last national Census. They concentrated Democratic voters to create overwhelming Democratic majorities in the core of bigger metropolitan areas but with fewer seats. Republican votes, by contrast, are more efficiently distributed over a broader number of congressional districts.\n\nThat was illustrated in the presidential election. Although Trump won 2.9 million fewer popular votes than Clinton, he carried more congressional districts, 230 to 205.\n\nAnd the election is still nine months away. Continued economic growth and the impact of voters seeing more take-home pay as a result of the Republican tax cuts could shift public attitudes toward Trump.\n\nIn individual races, the candidates the Democrats run can matter as much as broader national issues, and Republicans can exploit the considerable political advantages of incumbency. Those GOP officeholders are steeling themselves for a turbulent election that won\u2019t take any of them by surprise.\n\n\u201cOpen seats are a key part of a potential Democratic House takeover,\u201d Kyle Kondik, the managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, said in a Jan. 18 analysis, \u201cbut the majority of Democratic gains will have to come from beating GOP incumbents.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jennifer Epstein", "body": "U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was ousted Tuesday after months of strained relations with President Donald Trump, who sometimes used tweets to disparage the former Exxon Mobil CEO\u2019s efforts at international diplomacy.\nTrump said he is nominating CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace Tillerson.\n\"I am proud to nominate the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Mike Pompeo, to be our new Secretary of State,\u201d Trump said in a statement.\n\n        \n        \u201cAs Director of the CIA, Mike has earned the praise of members in both parties by strengthening our intelligence gathering, modernizing our defensive and offensive capabilities, and building close ties with our friends and allies in the international intelligence community,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI have gotten to know Mike very well over the past 14 months, and I am confident he is the right person for the job at this critical juncture.

Bernstein/Bloomberg\u201cThe threshold is there has to be value for the American people to hear a public hearing, and I have yet to identify anything that I need to know that they haven\u2019t answered,\u201d Burr said.He hasn\u2019t ruled one out, however. \u201cI\u2019ll wait and see if somebody presents me a plausible reason to have one,\u201d he said.Testimony Transcripts\n        \n        Kushner and Trump Jr. testified separately last year behind closed doors before both the House and Senate Intelligence committees, and Trump Jr. also testified to the Senate Judiciary staff, though all of the transcripts of those sessions remain closely held so far. Grassley, the Judiciary chairman, has said that he intends to make his committee\u2019s transcripts public soon.Grassley said recently that his committee\u2019s investigation into the Trump Tower meeting was over because Kushner was \u201cspooked\u201d out of providing a voluntary closed-door interview with the panel\u2019s staff. The chairman blamed ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein\u2019s unilateral release of the transcript from an interview with another key witness -- Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, who commissioned an unverified dossier on Trump from former British spy Christopher Steele.Feinstein, in turn, said the transcripts of the committee\u2019s interviews should be provided to Mueller and reiterated her calls for a public hearing.\u201cTransparency in congressional investigations is important. I hope this means Chairman Grassley will move forward with public hearings for Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner, which we agreed to pursue last year,\u201d she said in a statement.Grassley had threatened to subpoena Trump Jr., among others, to testify, before announcing an agreement in July of last year for a staff interview \u201cprior to a public hearing.\u201dThe Iowa Republican hasn\u2019t yet ruled out compelling Kushner or Trump Jr. to appear in public through a subpoena, something Feinstein and other Democrats have been prepared to do for months. But he said he wants \u201cto know what we would accomplish\u201d by doing so. Instead, he said he hopes to get access to Kushner\u2019s staff interview with the Senate Intelligence Committee, though Burr has said he would share transcripts only with Mueller.\u2018Keep Working\u2019The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner, who with Burr has strived to keep a bipartisan approach to the panel\u2019s probe, also continues to push for public hearings where lawmakers can question major figures, including Trump Jr. and Kushner.\u201cWe\u2019ll keep working through this,\u201d Warner said. \u201cThe public has a lot of questions and equally important, a lot of senators need to talk to a lot of these principals.\u201dSenate Intelligence committee staffers have interviewed well over 100 people in that panel\u2019s yearlong probe so far. It\u2019s likely to take more months to conclude, with Burr and Warner planning to release an interim joint report in coming weeks on election security while there\u2019s still time to plan for November\u2019s mid-term elections.\n        \n        \n        \n        Grassley has told the Judiciary panel that the transcripts he plans to release include interviews with those who attended the Trump Tower meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. That will include the transcript of Trump Jr.\u2019s interview, several other attendees, and a written response from Veselnitskaya.Several Democrats, however, say there\u2019s no substitute for the key eyewitnesses appearing in public.\u201cFor me, I\u2019m going to push back with everything I have, if somebody tries to say this is over without Jared Kushner and Donald Trump Jr. coming to the committee to answer questions,\u201d said Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon, an Intelligence Committee member.", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Michael P Dempsey", "body": "President Vladimir Putin\u2019s re-election on Sunday to a fourth six-year term comes amid a feeling both in the West and in Moscow that he is ascendant as a global leader and that Russia has reemerged as a global superpower. However, if one scratches beneath the surface of these assertions, it\u2019s clear that Putin faces a growing number of complex challenges that are likely to deepen in the coming months and gradually erode his political momentum. Here are a few that will be the most difficult for him to overcome.\nIn Syria, as I wrote last year, Russia is increasingly stuck on both the military and diplomatic fronts. On the battlefield, Putin has repeatedly boasted that Russia\u2019s military goals in Syria have been accomplished -- the defeat of extremist groups threatening the regime of Bashar al-Assad -- and that he soon plans to draw down Russian military forces. However, given the chaotic situation on the ground -- the Assad regime still controls only about one-third of the country -- that seems unlikely anytime soon.\nThe cost of Moscow\u2019s presence in Syria, meanwhile, continues to grow. In the past few weeks, the Russians have suffered the crash of a military transport with several senior officers on board, the downing of a Russian fighter jet by anti-government forces, a clash involving American-backed forces and Russian mercenaries that produced dozens of Russian casualties, and an attack by insurgents using drones on two of its bases. The latter reportedly damaged several Russian aircraft, and is likely to be repeated in the coming months.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        There are also, despite recent regime advances, still thousands of Islamic State and al Qaeda-affiliated extremists operating in Syria, as well as many thousand embittered and heavily armed opponents of the Assad regime, who will never accept his legitimacy. A question: Is it likely that Assad\u2019s political opponents will embrace a spirit of political reconciliation in the wake of the regime\u2019s brutal conduct in the ongoing Eastern Ghouta campaign?\nOn the diplomatic front, meanwhile, Putin had hoped his 2015 military intervention would pave the way for Moscow to play a lead role in negotiating a final resolution to the civil war -- one that would bolster Russia\u2019s diplomatic influence regionally and secure its defense and commercial interests in Syria in the post-conflict reconstruction phase. Instead, it\u2019s crystal clear, and has been for some time, that Assad has no intention of negotiating his departure from office, that the opposition will never trust him, and that countries such as Turkey and Iran have their own distinct visions for Syria\u2019s future, and their roles in it.\nFinally, there is no chance that the U.S. and the West will provide major reconstruction aid to Syria as long as Assad is in power. This is especially problematic for Assad (and Putin) given that America\u2019s Kurdish-backed allies now control most of the critical oilfields in Eastern Syria. Therefore, it\u2019s a safe bet that Assad is unlikely to have sufficient money to begin rebuilding Syria\u2019s badly damaged infrastructure in the near future, even though this is critical to ensuring his long-term political viability. So, while Russia had hoped by this point in the conflict to present a bill to Assad for services rendered, it may instead be presented with a tab for money owed. Nearly three years on from Russia\u2019s military intervention, then, Putin is discovering that playing both fireman and arsonist in Syria is a difficult needle to thread.\nIf Syria is a mess, how about the situation in Eastern Ukraine? For Putin, that\u2019s not looking good either. Despite periodic spikes in fighting over the past few months, the front lines (as well as the negotiations for a political settlement) have been largely static. So, even if Putin (at least for now) has succeeded in preventing Kiev from pursuing closer integration with the West, the cost is steep and growing steeper by the month.\nRussia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine is continuing to prompt punishing economic sanctions from the U.S. and its European allies with no relief in sight. This at a time when Russia\u2019s economic growth is already anemic (the World Bank forecasts GDP growth of below 2 percent through 2019) and with 20 million or so Russians already living below the official poverty rate of $180 per month. Even more ominous, the loss of access to U.S. and Western technology and investment over such an extended period is going to erode Russia\u2019s long-term economic competitiveness.\n\n        \n        It\u2019s also worth noting that Russia\u2019s intervention is steadily undermining traditionally high public sentiments toward Russia in Ukraine. According to recent polling, more than 60 percent of young Ukrainians now believe that Moscow is responsible for the escalation of the conflict, while only five percent blame Kiev. In short, Putin is steadily turning the next generation of Ukrainians against Russia.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. has finally announced plans to provide Kiev with so-called lethal defensive aid including more than 200 Javelin anti-tank missiles and 37 launch units in the coming weeks. This equipment will certainly help Ukrainian units counter the old-model tanks that Moscow has provided to the separatists in recent years. As in Syria, then, Russia is finding that intervening in the Ukraine conflict was far easier than extricating itself.\nIn the run-up to the election, Putin trumpeted Russia\u2019s resurgence under his leadership, skillfully portrayed Russia as a victim even as it acted aggressively abroad, spoke publicly (and menacingly) of Russia\u2019s newfound military prowess, and engaged in a series of brazen acts, most notably the reported nerve agent attack against two Russians residing in England. If he intends to govern in his next term according to this script, the U.S. and its allies will have little choice but to push back hard.\nSome of the options that policymakers might consider include: new and creative ways to raise the military cost to Russia for its foreign interventions; sweeping policies to further curb Russia\u2019s access to advanced technology; measures to eliminate the ability of Putin\u2019s cronies to hide money abroad; active cyber operations against Russian entities involved in hacking; and aggressive public messaging efforts to highlight Putin\u2019s anti-democratic actions and expose the sources of his vast personal wealth, especially to audiences inside Russia.\nIt seems clear to me\u00a0 -- \u00a0I'm currently on a government-funded fellowship and these\u00a0opinions are solely mine\u00a0 --\u00a0all this adds up to a daunting set of challenges Putin faces in the coming years. And it\u2019s certain that provoking a more intense and direct confrontation with the West is not going to make his job any easier.\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\nTo contact the author of this story:\n                Michael Dempsey     at mdempsey@cfr.org\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:\n                Tobin Harshaw     at tharshaw@bloomberg.net", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jennifer A Dlouhy", "body": "Russian hackers are conducting a broad assault on the U.S. electric grid, water processing plants, air transportation facilities and other targets in rolling attacks on some of the country\u2019s most sensitive infrastructure, U.S. government officials said Thursday.\nThe announcement was the first official confirmation that Russian hackers have taken aim at facilities on which hundreds of millions of Americans depend for basic services. Bloomberg News reported in July that Russian hackers had breached more than a dozen power plants in seven states, an aggressive campaign that has since expanded to dozens of states, according to a person familiar with the investigation.\n\"Since at least March 2016, Russian government cyber actors\" have targeted \"government entities and multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors,\" including those of energy, nuclear, water and aviation, according to an alert issued Thursday by the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        Critical manufacturing sectors and commercial facilities also have been targeted by the ongoing \"multi-stage intrusion campaign by Russian government cyber actors.\"\nCyber-attacks are \"literally happening hundreds of thousands of times a day,\" Energy Secretary Rick Perry told lawmakers during a hearing Thursday. \"The warfare that goes on in the cyberspace is real, it\u2019s serious, and we must lead the world.\"\nSeparately Thursday, the U.S. sanctioned a St. Petersburg-based \u201ctroll farm,\u201d two Russian intelligence services, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian citizens and businesses indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on charges of meddling with the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\nA joint analysis by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security described hackers as extremely sophisticated, in some cases first breaching suppliers and third-party vendors before hopping from those networks to their ultimate target. The government\u2019s report did not say how successful the attacks were.\nRead More: Russia Is Said to Be Suspect in Hacks of U.S. Power Plants\n\n        \n        The Russian hackers \"targeted small commercial facilities\u2019 networks where they staged malware, conducted spear phishing, and gained remote access into energy sector networks,\" according to the Homeland Security alert.\nThe hackers deliberately selected targets and methodically went after initial victims as a way to reach their ultimate prizes, including industrial control systems used by power plants and other infrastructure. Their tactics included sending spear-phishing emails and embedding malicious content on informational websites to obtain security credentials they could then leverage for more information and access.\nAnd once they obtained access, the attackers \"conducted network reconnaissance,\" and moved within the systems to collect information on industrial control systems.\n\n        \n        The government\u2019s alert on Russian cyber-attacks does not cover suspected meddling by the country in the 2016 election.\nAn October report by researchers at Symantec Corp., cited by the U.S. government Thursday, linked the attacks to a group of hackers it had code-named Dragonfly, and said it found evidence critical infrastructure facilities in Turkey and Switzerland also had been breached.\nThe Symantec researchers said an earlier wave of attacks by the same group starting in 2011 was used to gather intelligence on companies and their operational systems. The hackers then used that information for a more advanced wave of attacks targeting industrial control systems that, if disabled, leave millions without power or water.\nThe disclosure comes amid mounting calls from lawmakers to step up protection of the nation\u2019s electric grid. Senator Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, pushed for a cyberthreat assessment of the grid last year, to better defend the infrastructure against potential attacks.\n\"I hope today\u2019s belated response is the first step in a robust and aggressive strategy to protect our critical infrastructure,\" Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state, said in an emailed statement.\nU.S. intelligence officials have long been concerned about the security of the country\u2019s electrical grid. The recent attacks, striking almost simultaneously at multiple locations, are testing the government\u2019s ability to coordinate an effective response among several private utilities, state and local officials, and industry regulators.\nMany of the targeted power plants are conventional, but the attacks included at least one nuclear power plant in Kansas, Bloomberg News reported in July. While the core of a nuclear generator is heavily protected, a sudden shutdown of the turbine can trigger safety systems. These safety devices are designed to disperse excess heat while the nuclear reaction is halted, but the safety systems themselves may be vulnerable to attack.\nThe operating systems at nuclear plants also tend to be legacy controls built decades ago and don\u2019t have digital control systems that can be exploited by hackers.\n\u2014 With assistance by Toluse Olorunnipa, Ari Natter, and Nafeesa Syeed", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Andrew Mayeda", "body": "In a two-week span, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered up an array of tariffs against numerous countries, blocked Chinese takeovers of U.S. companies and sought new restrictions on future Chinese investment. Economists are warning that the world is on the verge of an all-out trade war, featuring tit-for-tat reprisals, heated rhetoric and appeals to the World Trade Organization, which may be ill-equipped to respond. If Trump\u2019s trade provocations mushroom out of control, dozens of border-opening trade deals negotiated over several decades could be shoved aside. The prospect of slower economic growth has stock markets worldwide reeling.\n1. What is a trade war?The dictionary says it\u2019s\u00a0\u201can economic conflict in which countries impose import restrictions on each other in order to harm each other\u2019s trade.\u201d Trump\u2019s tariffs and the threatened retaliation from other countries meet this definition, but so do centuries of protectionist skirmishes by numerous countries in countless sectors.\u00a0The recent escalation is stoking fears that Trump has touched off a full-blown trade war by singling out of China for retaliation for intellectual property theft. The quid-pro-quo actions by the U.S. and China over steel tariffs, Trump\u2019s invocation of national security to justify some of his moves -- which could open a Pandora\u2019s Box of similar claims by other nations -- and Trump\u2019s threat to further punish the EU if it imposes counter-duties also add to the trade-war atmospherics.\n2. What happened in previous trade wars?One of the most notorious examples is the Smoot-Hawley Act passed by Congress in 1930 and\u00a0often blamed for deepening the Great Depression. The law hiked U.S. tariffs by an average of 20 percent, initially to protect American farmers but then broadened as other industries lobbied for protections. As demand collapsed, countries scrambled to maintain their gold reserves by devaluing their currencies or imposing even more trade barriers. Global trade fell off a cliff.\n3. Who wins in trade wars?\n        \n        No one, if history is any guide.\u00a0When President George W. Bush raised steel tariffs in 2002, U.S. gross domestic product declined by $30.4 million, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. The U.S. lost about 200,000 jobs, about 13,000 of which were in raw steel-making, by one estimate. A report by the pro-free trade Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that Bush\u2019s tariffs cost about $400,000 for every steel-industry job saved.\u00a0The World Trade Organization also ruled that the Bush tariffs were illegal.\u00a0\n4. What has Trump done so far?\nHe\u2019s imposing tariffs on up to $60 billion of as-yet unspecified products imported from China in retaliation for what he calls decades of intellectual property theft. He imposed tariffs of 25 percent and 10 percent, respectively, on steel and aluminum imports, which prompted China to say it could hit back with tariffs of its own. While he temporarily exempted allies, including the European Union, from the metals tariffs, he expects them to grant concessions to the U.S. to maintain the exemption.\n5. Why did Trump invite this fight?In a March 2 Twitter post, he declared trade wars \u201cgood, and easy to win.\u201d His focus remains reducing the U.S. trade deficit, which shows the country imports hundreds of billions of dollars more than it exports. Stepping back from trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership also appeals to Trump\u2019s base of voters in America\u2019s Rust Belt. But talk of a trade war is alarming to many U.S. business leaders, who largely support existing trade deals, and the securities markets, which fear lower profits and slower economic growth if the U.S. turns protectionist and other countries retaliate.\n6. Who has retaliated?So far, China said it would hit $3 billion of U.S. wine, fruit, steel pipe and other exports with tariffs. The bigger worry for the U.S. is that China, the U.S.\u2019s biggest creditor, will scale back purchases of Treasuries in retaliation. China\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. doesn\u2019t rule out the option. Other countries haven\u2019t retaliated for the steel and aluminum tariffs, which took effect March 23, largely because Trump temporarily exempted many of them. Still, the EU is unhappy and warned it will respond with its own 25 percent tariffs on $3.5 billion of American goods, particularly iconic U.S. brands produced in states that are part of Trump\u2019s political base.\u00a0The list includes motorcycles, blue jeans and bourbon whiskey. In turn, Trump warned that he would impose a 25 percent penalty on European car imports if the EU carried out its threat.\n7. When does the WTO get involved?The U.S. took the first step on March 23, filing a \"request for consultations\" with China at the WTO on technology licensing. China also notified the WTO how it could respond to the steel tariffs with levies of its own. But retaliatory actions that unfold quickly can test the WTO\u2019s somewhat ponderous deliberative process. The arbiter of international trade disputes was born in 1995 out of a set of agreements struck by countries trying to reduce trade barriers. If a government\u2019s complaint about another nation\u2019s trade barriers is seen as grounded, the WTO recommends acceptable retaliation. In the case of steel, Trump is invoking a seldom-used clause of a 1962 U.S. law that gives him the authority to curb imports if they undermine national security. Under WTO rules,\u00a0countries can take trade actions to protect \u201cessential security interests.\u201d Other nations could challenge the validity of the U.S. use of that clause. They also could copy the U.S. move by citing national security to block imports themselves.\n8. Could tariffs backfire on the U.S.?\n        \n        Yes. Take steel tariffs. Many more people are employed in industries, such as auto manufacturing, that buy steel to make products, than in steel-making itself. Some consumers may also have to pay higher prices. Trade tensions could boost inflation more than desired by Federal Reserve policy makers, who might feel the need to raise rates more aggressively than planned. On the other hand, if the tariffs result in job losses and the economy slows, the Fed might want to ease the pace of rate hikes.\n9. Are tariffs the only weapon in trade wars?No, there are many others. Clamping down on Chinese investments in the U.S., which Trump is already doing, is one example. Talking down, or manipulating lower, one\u2019s currency is another. Countries through the years have used other means to keep foreign goods out and protect homegrown companies, a practice known as mercantilism. Trump accuses China of using government subsidies to prop up its domestic industries. Some practices are overt, such as quotas, and others covert, such as unusual product specifications, lengthy inspections of goods at entry ports and intricate licensing requirements.\nThe Reference ShelfQuickTake explainers on Trump\u2019s claim that China stole U.S. intellectual property, the 1962 law Trump cited for his steel tariffs, the difficulty of the U.S. quitting Nafta and Trump\u2019s solar-panel tariffs.

The president agreed with a New York Times reporter's question about whether doing so would amount to crossing a \"red line.\"\nMueller apparently has decided to cross that line anyway. The Times reported on Thursday that Mueller's team has subpoenaed Trump's company, the Trump Organization, for records pertaining to a number of business deals -- including some related to Russia.\nQuickTake QA: Guide to the Trump-Russia Probe\n\n        \n        Trump and his lawyers have thrown down all sorts of gauntlets around Mueller's probe. They have argued for a tight deadline leading to its conclusion, negotiated for where, when and how the president might agree to an interview with investigators, and pointed to areas that they think are off limits.\nIt would appear that Mueller, with the full force of the law and subpoena power behind him, intends to proceed as he sees fit.\nMueller has already made it clear that he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to look at Trump's business transactions. My Bloomberg News colleagues reported last July -- just a day after Trump conversed with the Times about that red line -- that Mueller was expanding the scope of his investigation to Trump's commercial dealings.\nMueller's probe seems to be pursuing three primary questions. The first is whether Trump or his campaign worked with the Kremlin to tilt the 2016 election in Trump's favor. The second is whether Trump or his advisers obstructed justice to derail the federal investigation. The third involves the possibility of financial quid pro quos that Trump and his family members (especially his son-in-law, Jared Kushner) may have sought in exchange for public policy favors (like, for example, possibly lifting economic sanctions on Russia or shifting U.S. Ukraine policy).\nThe quid pro quo stuff is likely to be all about money ultimately, and that's why the Times's scoop on Thursday is significant. Mueller is venturing into the Trump Organization itself, the nexus of all of the president's business deals. He's collecting records from a company that's inseparable from the president himself. No major transactions have occurred at the Trump Organization without Trump\u2019s blessing, and his unwillingness and failure to separate himself from his company since entering the White House makes that reality even more apparent.\n\n        \n        The president's intersection with Russian money is also a potential powder keg. The Times said that Mueller is examining a 2015 proposal by a Trump business partner, Felix Sater, to Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to orchestrate a real estate deal in Moscow. Sater claimed that he could get Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, to buy into the transaction and that doing so could help the president win the election.\nSater is, as they say in the trade, a character. And Cohen's efforts to contact the Kremlin about that deal relied on using a publicly available email address in the Kremlin's press office. That's not exactly the work of sophisticates who have contacts in the highest reaches of Russia's government.\nCohen has handled some of Trump's most sensitive matters, including payoffs to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        And Sater is a career criminal with organized crime ties. Trump and his children worked closely with him on the launch of the Trump SoHo Hotel and other real estate projects in the U.S. long before he set himself on course for the White House.\nAs I noted in a series of columns in 2016 and 2017, some of the murkiest financial dealings with possible Russian ties that Trump engaged in may have taken place in New York, not Moscow.\nTrump has repeatedly called Mueller's investigation a \"witch hunt,\" and his lawyers have\u00a0said\u00a0that the last decade of Trump\u2019s tax returns (which the president has\u00a0declined to release) would show that he had no income or loans from Russian sources. Last year, Trump\u00a0told NBC\u00a0that he had no property or investments in Russia.\n\"I am not involved in Russia,\" he said.\nBut Trump's description of his dealings doesn't allow for the fact that national security problems and other quandaries might arise for the president if Russia is involved in him -- either through potentially compromising business transactions and relationships in the U.S., or because of funds that might have flowed into his wallet years ago.\nSater's company, the Bayrock Group, operated out of Trump Tower, just two floors beneath the Trump Organization's headquarters. A former partner of Sater at Bayrock claimed that the company was run as a money laundering operation. Bayrock also allegedly got some of its funding from Eastern Europe and from Iceland, and the company paid Trump to put his name on their projects.\nAlthough Bayrock eventually went dormant, Sater never left the Trump team. He tried to engineer a diplomatic overture to Ukraine in early 2017, an effort he reportedly undertook with Cohen and which he tried to present to Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. And, of course, there is the 2015 Moscow deal he pitched to Cohen that Mueller is now examining.\nI have some history with Sater. Trump sued me in 2006, alleging that my biography, \u201cTrumpNation,\u201d had misrepresented his business record and his wealth. Trump lost the suit in 2011; my lawyers deposed him and Sater during the litigation.\nSater's intersection with the Trump Organization -- and the subpoena that landed on the company's doorstep -- probably should be reminders to the president, his family, and their lawyers that Mueller is content to draw his own lines in his investigation.\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\nTo contact the author of this story:\n                Timothy L.

The internal divisions flared this week after Trump congratulated Putin on his recent re-election without first reviewing written guidance that he not do so, a person familiar with the matter said.\nTrump has meanwhile reshaped his national security staff. On Thursday, he announced he would replace McMaster, who favored a tougher public posture toward Putin, with John Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations who is a staunch conservative and military hawk. That move came just a week after the president fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who had also adopted a more confrontational stance toward Russia, and nominated Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, to replace him.\n\n        \n        Congress has pressured Trump to get tougher on Putin and passed legislation in August giving lawmakers the power to block the president from lifting punitive U.S. measures imposed after Russia\u2019s incursion into Ukraine. Substantively, Washington\u2019s policy toward Russia has become tougher in recent months, though Trump\u2019s critics say he has dragged his feet in responding to Putin\u2019s provocations.\nRelationship PriorityTrump has agreed to adopt increasingly tough policy stances on Russia. But the president places a priority on maintaining a personal relationship with the Russian president, won\u2019t publicly attack him, and doesn\u2019t see any benefit to the U.S. in confronting Putin in one-on-one encounters, one administration official said Thursday.\nTrump defended his call with Putin on Twitter Wednesday, dismissing those who \u201cwanted me to excoriate him.\u201d\n\u201cThey are wrong!\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cGetting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.\u201d\n\n        \n        \n        \n        May earlier this month condemned Russia for the nerve-agent attack that critically injured the former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter Yulia. A British police officer was also hospitalized. May said the 23 Russians she ordered to leave Britain were undeclared spies, and she has sought the cooperation of other countries in her campaign to punish Moscow.\nHeather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said on Friday night that \"the United States is considering a range of options to respond to Russia\u2019s outrageous actions in the U.K., both to demonstrate our solidarity with our ally and to hold Russia accountable for its clear breach of international norms and agreements.\"\nShe added that the State Department \u201cdoesn\u2019t have any actions to announce today.\u201d\nRegardless of Trump\u2019s rhetoric, his administration sees the Kremlin as a threat.\nA national defense strategy assembled by the Pentagon under Mattis and publicly summarized in January described China and Russia as the top global adversaries of the U.S. Earlier this month, the administration slapped financial sanctions against a St. Petersburg-based internet \u201ctroll farm\u201d and its alleged owner -- a close Putin ally -- whom Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted over a covert social media campaign to influence the 2016 election.\n\u2014 With assistance by Margaret Talev", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Erik Larson", "body": "A federal court backed Pennsylvania\u2019s redrawn congressional voting map, making it likely that borders friendlier to Democrats will be in place for the midterm election as the party seeks to retake the U.S. House.\nA panel of three federal judges on Monday denied a request from eight Republican congressmen who sought to block the implementation of the revised map, which Pennsylvania\u2019s highest court drew up after ruling the earlier borders had been put in place to favor Republicans.

I think it will destroy the futures of the next generation in this country,\u201d says Chuka Umunna, the charismatic, 39-year-old member of Parliament who chairs the weekly gathering. \u201cBut it\u2018s not about what I think\u2014and shouting \u2018Stop Brexit\u2019 is not a political strategy. I want the people to get a vote.\u201d\nFor the first time, people in the anti-Brexit movement in the U.K. are getting organized. That\u2019s because, for the first time, they believe they can win. Ever since May lost her majority in Parliament after a catastrophic gamble on an early election last June, it\u2019s been clear that she is in a weak position to lead the country through withdrawal from the EU. For six months after her election failure, she held her ruling Conservative Party together and managed to navigate the first phase of Brexit negotiations, albeit only after agreeing to pay the other 27 member states a 40 billion-pound ($56.4 billion) divorce bill.\n\n        \n    \n\n    Then came her first defeat. On Dec. 13, 11 members of May\u2019s Tory party defied her orders and overturned the government\u2019s will in a key vote in Parliament. The rebels ensured that lawmakers will get a binding vote on whether to accept or reject May\u2019s final Brexit deal once negotiations with the EU end later this year. Put simply, this means that May must get an agreement that is good enough to please her own lawmakers, and that\u00a0she cannot simply impose her policy on the country.\nIt is this make-or-break vote\u00a0in Parliament\u2014which is likely to come around October this year\u2014that the Brexit resistance is now targeting. By lobbying legislators, they hope to block May\u2019s deal, bring about a new referendum, or perhaps\u00a0trigger a new national election. The pro-EU alliance that\u00a0Umunna chairs\u2014which includes\u00a0Brexit rebels in Parliament and thousands of activists around the country\u2014played a crucial role behind the scenes in inflicting the defeat on May.\nSpeaking in his exposed-wood and glass office overlooking the Palace of Westminster, Umunna\u00a0says\u00a0that campaigners across the country targeted different members of Parliament in the run-up to the December vote\u00a0to persuade them to back the rebellion. They got \u201can avalanche of emails and hundreds of visits\u201d\u00a0to their offices, he says.\u00a0\nIncreasingly, the public and politicians alike can see the dangers of Brexit\u00a0and are changing their attitude as the economic risks become clear, he says. A recent leak of government analysis showed how Brexit will reduce\u00a0growth by as much as 5 percentage points over 15 years\u00a0if there\u2019s a free-trade deal, or 8\u00a0points if there\u2019s no deal at all. The most-affected areas are likely to be some of those that voted heavily to leave the EU. \u201cIt terrified some people what it was saying was going to happen in their communities,\u201d Umunna says. \u201cIf it does happen, and they are still the members of Parliament, they won\u2019t be forgiven.\u201d\nChuka Umunna,\u00a0at Parliament.\nPhotographer: Felicity McCabe for Bloomberg Businessweek\nUmunna is always immaculately dressed, a slick media performer who briefly stood for the leadership of his Labour party in 2015, before what he called \u201cthe added level of pressure\u201d\u00a0prompted him to pull out of the race. (It was ultimately won by socialist firebrand Jeremy Corbyn). Until recently, he\u2019s been careful to keep quiet about the work of his Grassroots Coordinating Group, as the committee is unfashionably known. He won\u2019t say where or exactly when they meet, because he doesn\u2019t want the gatherings to be mobbed by photographers and reporters.\nAway from prying camera lenses, Umunna and his fellow Brexit rebels have been seeking\u00a0the help of European leaders for their mission. On Jan. 15, he joined senior members of the Conservative party, including Anna Soubry, a former business minister, and Dominic Grieve, who served as the U.K.\u2019s Tory attorney general (before masterminding May\u2019s December defeat), to visit the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator,\u00a0Michel Barnier, in Brussels. They\u2019ve met senior officials in other EU institutions, European foreign ministers, and ambassadors from the bloc\u2019s remaining 27 member states\u2014even the heads of foreign governments. Some involved privately confide that the access to senior EU politicians has been \u201cextraordinary.\u201d\u00a0\nThe high-level contact is paying off. While EU officials know they must tread lightly to avoid appearing to meddle in British affairs, they are privately feeding valuable intelligence on the unfolding negotiations to their British allies. On March 6, a day before the EU published its draft plan for the next phase of Brexit negotiations, Umunna\u00a0was\u00a0in his office, focusing on the future trade deal with the U.K.\u00a0He told\u00a0Bloomberg reporters something that not even the British government officially knew at that point: that the\u00a0EU would make clear in its document that its offer of a limited trade deal, with poor access for services such as banks, could be improved\u2014if May backs down on her own strict \u201cred lines.\u201d\nConservative Anna Soubry (left) and Labour\u2019s\u00a0Chuka Umunna,\u00a0members of Parliament\u00a0critical of Brexit, leave\u00a0BBC Broadcasting House in February.\nPhotographer: Vickie Flores/Alamy\nThe prime minister has laid down hard rules for the talks. She wants to leave the single market, the customs union, and the direct jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, as well as to end\u00a0the free migration of people. But Umunna\u2019s information proved accurate. When the bloc published its guidelines the following day, they said\u00a0that if May\u2019s position \u201cevolves\u201d and she backs down on these issues, the EU will be willing to consider making a better offer.\nThe EU\u2019s controversial gambit became known as the \u201cevolution clause.\u201d It was seen as an attempt to pry open divisions among U.K.\u00a0strategists, a temptation to water down May\u2019s hard-line stance. To some of the more paranoid anti-EU campaigners in the U.K., Umunna\u2019s prior knowledge of the clause will serve as evidence of an international conspiracy against Brexit.\n\n        \n    \n\n    May\u2019s\u00a0defeat in December was a turning point for politicians in Europe, too. For many EU officials in Brussels and European capitals, Brexit had seemed inevitable. Their only hope was to limit the damage that the split would do and try to find a way to plug the 10 billion-euro hole in the bloc\u2019s annual budget that the U.K.\u2019s exit will leave. All that changed after May lost the vote in Parliament. \u201cThey recognize that Theresa May does not necessarily have a mandate for her negotiating position,\u2019\u2019 Umunna says. \u201cThey are very aware that actually, she isn\u2019t in the driving seat of this. It is Parliament that will be in the driving seat.\u201d\nSince the start of the year, European leaders have lined up to tell Britain that it is free to change its mind. If May\u2014or a different prime minister\u2014were to write\u00a0to European Council President Donald Tusk to say Brexit is off, the EU would\u00a0welcome the country back into the club without hesitation, they say. While the EU continues to take the hardest line in the negotiations, officials have made clear privately that they will agree to pause the Brexit process to allow time for a new referendum, perhaps\u00a0even another election\u00a0if necessary, according to Umunna. \u201cIf a crisis is precipitated and there were a general election, or a new national poll, we would be granted the time to do that,\u201d he says.\nSix of the 10 groups that\u00a0send representatives to join Umunna\u2019s Wednesday morning coffee meetings have now moved into the same offices at Milbank Tower, a 10-minute walk from Parliament. This shared space\u2014along with the weekly gatherings\u2014makes it easier for the separate groups to brainstorm, decide on the best media lines to use, and coordinate their campaign strategy and activities. \u201cWe\u2019ve got six months to change the game and get a people\u2019s vote on the Brexit deal,\u201d says Eloise Todd, chief executive of Best for Britain, one of the groups in Umunna\u2019s weekly meeting. Partly because\u00a0it\u00a0accepts\u00a0large donations, including 400,000 pounds from billionaire investor George Soros, Best for Britain has found itself the target of right-wing newspapers that\u00a0campaigned for the U.K. to leave the EU.\nTodd reckons the press attacks backfired and fueled a surge of interest in\u2014and donations to\u2014her campaign. She puts the odds of engineering a new referendum at \u201c50/50.\u201d Her team has already trained 2,000 activists in street-campaigning techniques and aims to prepare an additional 1,000 by the end of April. Digital operations are also getting the funding and resources they will need for a massive \u201cRemain\u201d\u00a0campaign\u00a0designed to build support over the summer for a referendum on May\u2019s exit deal. Many in the movement believe that only a new public vote would have the political legitimacy to halt Brexit.\nThe public is warming to the idea of having the final say on the Brexit deal, says James McGrory, executive director of Open Britain. With more than 500,000 supporters, his is the largest group attending\u00a0Umunna's weekly meetings. \u201cThis is not a slam dunk, either with the public or Parliament,\u201d\u00a0McGrory says. \u201cPeople will holler and say, \u2018How dare you?\u2019\u00a0but what is absolutely critical is that the democratic argument is on our side.\u201d\nLabour MPs\u00a0Chuka Umunna\u00a0(forward, holding sign) and Harriet Harmon (to his immediate right, wearing blue) campaign to remain\u00a0 in the EU\u00a0in June 2016.\nPhotographer: Nicola Tree/Getty Images\nThe campaign against May's version of Brexit faces huge challenges. There is no clear evidence that a new referendum would deliver a different result. In order to bring about a second national vote\u2014against May\u2019s wishes\u2014Umunna and company will need to persuade enough Conservative politicians to defy their leader on an issue that could bring down her government. They must also convince the main opposition Labour Party to back their cause. At the moment, Corbyn does not support a new referendum, though he hasn't ruled it out in the future. Umunna believes that Labour\u2019s leadership\u00a0could be persuaded, \u201cparticularly if they\u00a0feel it can bring a general election closer.\u201d\nNevertheless, the first task for the campaign groups is to make more noise in the run-up to the Parliamentary vote on May\u2019s Brexit deal in October. \u201cThere is a weird silence that has befallen our country,\u201d says Todd. \u201cBusinesses have persuaded themselves that they are Brexiting\u00a0and they need to shore up their political capital.

To date, his approach has been to say as little as possible. But he needs to strike a complicated balance in light of Trump\u2019s popularity among Republican voters and his toxicity among Democrats and independents, who could help Democrats win the House in congressional elections later this year.\nLawmakers took some comfort in statements from Trump attorney Ty Cobb and White House officials that Trump wasn\u2019t planning to fire Mueller. But Trump continued to attack the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d and he hired Joseph diGenova, a former federal prosecutor who has said Trump is the victim of a \u201cbrazen plot\u201d by the FBI and the Justice Department. DiGenova also has repeatedly criticized the Trump appointee who oversees Mueller\u2019s probe, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\nUndermining MuellerBack in January, McConnell said he saw no need to pass proposed legislation to protect Mueller because he knew of no \u201cofficial\u201d White House effort to undermine him. That position is no longer tenable, some Democrats said.\n\u201cThe presumption of that response has now been exploded by both the president and his lawyers,\u201d said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, a senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.\nFor one thing, the White House was slow to try to defuse Trump\u2019s attacks on Mueller. It took more than 24 hours for Cobb to issue his statement saying Trump had no plans to fire the special counsel.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        For Newest Lawyer, Trump Picks Fierce Critic of Mueller\u2019s Probe\nDiGenova\u2019s addition to Trump\u2019s team is a signal that Trump\u2019s lawyers don\u2019t see the probe ending soon. It may also reflect growing dissatisfaction by Trump with his lawyers\u2019 be-patient assurances that he should let the Mueller probe take its course.\nCobb had said since the summer that the investigation wouldn\u2019t stretch beyond the end of 2017. Trump and his legal team have been cooperating with the Mueller probe so far and have been negotiating terms for Mueller to interview Trump.\n\n        \n        Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, perhaps Trump\u2019s most prominent Republican critic in the Senate, said he hoped his party\u2019s leaders would speak out for Mueller.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always felt, and a lot of my colleagues have said privately, that\u2019s the red line we can not cross,\u201d Flake said Monday. \u201cI hope that leadership stands up and is more forceful in saying, \u2018Don\u2019t go there.\u201d\u2019\nA senior Republican senator said Monday evening that legislation to protect the special counsel isn\u2019t necessary.\n\u2018Straight Shooter\u2019\u201cI know Mueller well and believe him to be a straight shooter, and I continue to believe that giving Mueller the time and support necessary to get to the bottom of things is in the best interest of all parties involved,\u201d Orrin Hatch of Utah said in a statement. \u201cMy conversations with the White House have led him me to believe legislation is not necessary at this point because I do not believe the president would take such a foolish action.\u201d\nBut Democratic Senator Ron Wyden said all lawmakers should speak out now.\n\u201cEvery single member of Congress should regard this particular moment as one of the most important in their period of public service, because this is a fundamental question of American values,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cAre we going to secure the rule of law, or in effect are we just going to, you know, let the politics of raw power and brute force make these decisions?\u201d\nLegislation SoughtThe attacks have alarmed a number of Senate Democrats, some of whom are pressing their colleagues not just for statements but also to back legislation.\nWhitehouse said the attacks on Mueller should prompt a markup in the Judiciary Committee on legislation to protect Mueller\u2019s job. Bipartisan bills requiring judicial oversight of any effort to fire a special counsel received a hearing on Sept. 26.\nThe Democratic sponsor of one of the bills, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, said he\u2019s going to press hard this week for action -- maybe even on the must-pass omnibus spending bill needed to keep the government open past Friday night.\nCan Trump Dismiss the Special Counsel? Not Exactly: QuickTake\nDemocratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware said he\u2019ll also push for a bipartisan statement warning of consequences if Trump fires Mueller, noting that the president previously said he wasn\u2019t about to oust Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, only to go ahead and fire him.\n\u201cClearly stating to the president what the consequences would be, how seriously we would take that, is something I\u2019m going to be working relentlessly on this week, and trying to find Republican partners willing to do that,\" Coons said.\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley has urged the proponents of the two bills aimed at preventing Mueller\u2019s dismissal without cause to negotiate a compromise, according to Grassley spokesman George Hartmann.\n\u201cIt appears that some recent progress has been made along these lines,\u201d Hartmann said, but he added that \u201cthe constitutionality of legislation that affects the executive\u2019s ability to appoint and remove members of the executive branch remains an important concern.\u201d\nThe lead sponsors of the bills are Republican Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, both of whom have reiterated their opposition to firing Mueller since Trump\u2019s new attacks over the weekend.\nNo Bills NeededThe No. 2 Senate Republican leader, John Cornyn of Texas, said he doesn\u2019t think lawmakers need to do anything yet because he doesn\u2019t believe Trump will act.\n\u201cObviously, legislation requires a presidential signature. I don\u2019t see the necessity of picking that fight right now,\u201d he said.\nWhile conceding Trump\u2019s attacks on Mueller aren\u2019t helpful, Cornyn said the message has been sent to the president many times, formally and informally, that he shouldn\u2019t fire Mueller.\nBut like most Republicans, he wouldn\u2019t name a specific consequence Trump would face if he went ahead and did it anyway.\nDemocrats aren\u2019t unanimous in their worries.\nDianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said she was heartened by seeing Republicans like House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy speaking out over the weekend against any effort to shut down the Mueller probe.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we need it,\" she said of the legislation to protect Mueller. \u201cI was listening to various comments even from Republicans like Trey Gowdy. And people felt very strongly it would be a major breach for the president to fire Mr. Mueller. I agree with that.\u201d\n\u2018Rip Apart\u2019Efforts to remove him \u201cwould rip apart this administration,\u201d Feinstein predicted.\nAnd Graham, who warned over the weekend that firing Mueller would be the beginning of the end of Trump\u2019s presidency, says he\u2019s not worried either.\n\u201cI have zero concerns that the president or his team is going to fire Bob Mueller,\u201d he said. \u201cZero.\u201d\nIf that did happen, he predicted Congress would step in and reinstate Mueller.\n\u201cIf he got fired without cause, there would probably be an effort to reinstate him as an independent counsel,\u201d he said, although it\u2019s not clear whether such a push could overcome a presidential veto.\n\u2014 With assistance by Laura Litvan, and Shannon Pettypiece", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Chris Dolmetsch", "body": "President Donald Trump can\u2019t avoid a former \"Apprentice\" contestant\u2019s defamation lawsuit and may be forced to respond under oath to allegations of sexual assault and his treatment of women.\nSummer Zervos, a contender on The Apprentice in 2005, sued Trump in January 2017 alleging he \u201cambushed\u201d her on more than one occasion starting in 2007, kissing her, touching her breast and pressing his genitals against her.

The judge\u2019s ruling cited the Supreme Court\u2019s 1997 decision in Paula Jones\u2019s lawsuit against Bill Clinton, which held that the president doesn\u2019t have immunity in federal lawsuits over purely private acts.\n\"This case seems to be turning on the very question that the Supreme Court left open in Clinton versus Jones, which is whether their same decision would apply in a state court case,\" Mezey said.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        Zervos said Trump injured her reputation by denying that he groped her and branding women who accused him of similar behavior as liars.

He has said she continued to attempt to contact him and seek employment even after he made the alleged unwanted sexual advances -- and only turned against him after he failed to accept an invitation to her restaurant.\nTrump had also argued that he\u2019s immune from lawsuits in state court, citing the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. He has cited the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Jones\u2019s lawsuit against Clinton, where the justices ruled her federal case could proceed. But the nation\u2019s highest court explicitly stated that it wasn\u2019t deciding if lawsuits in state court could proceed against a president.\n\"There is absolutely no authority for dismissing or staying a civil action related purely to unofficial conduct because defendant is president,\" Schecter said. \"Even after Clinton v.

Tuesday night, state union leaders and the Governor Jim Justice reached a deal, and the teachers were expected to be back at work on Thursday.\nThey didn\u2019t go.\nUnsatisfied with the resolution, they stayed on the picket line, mounting one of the country\u2019s biggest unauthorized \u201cwildcat\u201d strikes in decades. \u201cI think that teachers had just finally had enough,\u201d said striking English teacher Erica Rodeheaver.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        As uncommon as work stoppages have become in the U.S., big wildcat strikes like West Virginia\u2019s are almost unheard of. It arrives at a moment when organized labor, already in steep decline, is facing a new emergency: The Supreme Court heard arguments Monday in a case that\u2019s expected by June to end mandatory union fees for all government employees, an outcome that would slash unions\u2019 budgets and power.\nAgainst this backdrop, the strike in West Virginia, where unions lack both mandatory fees and formal collective bargaining rights, has become for some a beacon, an example of the type of disruptive activism that could keep the labor movement alive.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the most important thing going on in the labor movement in recent years,\u201d said Joe Burns, the director of bargaining for the Association of Flight Attendants. \u201cI think it presents a path forward for the labor movement: solidarity and strike action.\u201d\nWest Virginia teachers say several factors convinced them to take the risk of striking. In addition to rising health-care costs and unusually low pay -- the state\u2019s average teacher salary was $45,622 in 2016, about 22 percent below the national average -- they found safety in numbers. The state already has hundreds of teacher vacancies, made existing employees that much more valuable. And the lack of formal collective bargaining rights, along with the state legislature\u2019s years-long refusal to address their grievances, left them without much recourse.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst thing that could happen \u2013 they fire me and I have to go get a job that pays more money than this?\u201d said Catherine Pizzino, who\u2019s in her 29th year teaching math.

Many doubted that the legislature would actually sign off on the governor\u2019s agreement to raise their pay by 5 percent, and they weren\u2019t happy that the deal created a task force to address escalating health costs in lieu of a concrete solution.\nSome said they also felt responsible to the teachers who planned to keep striking, because they wouldn\u2019t cross a picket line. \u201cEven though they said that we\u2019d go back on Thursday, nobody was ready to go at any school that I visited \u2013 and I visited a lot of schools,\u201d said history teacher and local union officer Greg Phillips.\nThis kind of workplace turbulence could become more common if the Supreme Court gets rid of mandatory fees, a decision that would make more of the country \u201cright-to-work.\u201d Many states legalized collective bargaining and mandatory fees in hopes of averting wildcat disruptions and securing \u201clabor peace,\u201d and they largely have.\nIf more moderate members decline to fund their unions, the remaining members could prove more eager for aggressive action. If unions can\u2019t get the state to guarantee they can collect fees from everyone they\u2019re representing, they could be more hesitant to give the state a guarantee that their members won\u2019t strike. And if some unions give up their right to represent non-members and reboot as \u201cmembers-only\u201d groups advocating just for those who pay dues, unions could end up in competition with one another, trying to outdo each other with more militant, demonstrative protests.\n\u201cWhat we could see is multiple organizations competing for membership and for shop floor leadership in these workplaces, and as a result making it harder for employers to settle controversies,\u201d said Shaun Richman, a former organizing director for the American Federation of Teachers. \u201cWest Virginia is a good example of what this could look like: you\u2019ll have competing unions, competing over who can take the bigger action.\u201d\nOn Thursday, Governor Justice told a crowd of teachers he was trying his best to reach a resolution. \u201cI\u2019m not king,\u201d he said from his SUV. \u201cI\u2019m doing what all I can possibly do.\u201d But while the 5 percent raise he proposed was passed by a supermajority in the state house Wednesday, it\u2019s having a harder time in the state senate, which referred it to the body\u2019s Finance committee.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in a state of limbo,\u201d said striking teacher Kristina Gore.

Yet his command of the nation\u2019s 1.2 million active duty personnel makes him uniquely placed to steer Trump away from any rash decision to unleash the U.S. military.\nTrump stunned his own aides this month by reshaping his foreign policy team in a more hawkish bent ahead of a key decision on the Iran nuclear deal and a historic summit with North Korea\u2019s leader. With a tweet, he said he\u2019d replace Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Then Thursday he tapped former United Nations ambassador John Bolton to be his third national security adviser in 14 months, dismissing H.R. McMaster.\n\n        \n        While the 67-year-old Mattis has broken with his boss on several top policy issues, he\u2019s as permanent a fixture as anyone can be in the tumultuous Trump administration.\n\u2018Last Man Standing\u2019\u201cHe\u2019ll be the last man standing,\u201d said MacKenzie Eaglen, a defense analyst with the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cHe is the most powerful Cabinet member and knows it. He gets to run DoD and be a shadow secretary of state.\u201d\nMattis made rare public comments alongside Trump on Friday when the president announced his decision to sign a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill that earlier in the day he threatened to veto. Trump cited a $70 billion boost to the Pentagon budget as the overriding reason for him to sign the legislation, singling out a number of priority weapons projects that could now go forward.\n\u201cWe need to take care of our military,\u201d Trump said.\n\n        \n        Taking the microphone, the four-star general lauded Trump\u2019s decision to sign the funding bill by citing comments attributed to President George Washington in the 1790s, saying the support will help guarantee peace. \u201cWe in the military are humbled\u201d by the backing provided by the American people, he added.\n\n        \n        It\u2019s clear from their relationship that Mattis \u201cwon\u2019t be next\u201d to leave the administration, Eaglen said, even though his three predecessors at the Pentagon -- Ash Carter, Chuck Hagel and Leon Panetta -- each lasted two years or less in the job.\nSee a list of all the officials who have left the Trump White House\nMattis, who Trump introduced to the country more than a year ago using the general\u2019s \u201cMad Dog\u201d nickname, will still have to contend with the rise of Pompeo and Bolton. The two are widely viewed as more hardline conservatives who have openly championed the utility of regime change and pre-emptive strikes abroad.\nSo far, Mattis\u2019s term as defense secretary has been characterized by a low-profile approach seemingly designed to limit \u201cgotcha\u201d moments where he might be seen as openly contradicting his boss. He\u2019s held only two televised press conferences in the Pentagon briefing room -- one last April after a cruise missile attack on Syria and the other in May, directed by Trump, to tout progress against the Islamic State.\n\u2018Locked and Loaded\u2019But he has shown flashes of disagreement.\nIn a pep talk overseas last year, Mattis told U.S. soldiers to \u201chold the line\u201d until Americans respect each other again, a comment many analysts interpreted as a criticism of the rhetoric emerging from Washington.\nAfter Trump said in August that U.S. forces were \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to confront the North Korean regime, Mattis helped calm tensions by saying \u201cnothing\u2019s changed\u201d in U.S. force posture and continuing with a tour of the U.S. west coast. \u201cU.S. forces maintain their usual high state of readiness in their deployed positions,\u201d he said.\nAnd while Trump has repeatedly labeled the 2015 deal with Iran to curtail its nuclear program a \u201cdisaster,\u201d and threatened to tear the agreement up by mid-May, Mattis has been more cautious. He told the Senate Armed Services Committee in October that if the U.S. \u201ccan confirm that Iran is living by the agreement,\u201d he believed \u201cthis is something the president should consider staying with.\u201d\nModeration and BombastThat tightrope act between moderation and bombast seems to have worked so far. Trump referred to Mattis as \u201cour great military genius-slash-person\u201d in December. And the defense secretary earned a laudatory presidential tweet when he said it would be \u201cgame on\u201d if North Korea fires missiles at the U.S.\nIn at least one way, Mattis has had a simpler job than any of his counterparts did: he oversees a department whose success Trump holds paramount and whose budget he has long sought to increase.\nUnlike Tillerson, Mattis also seems to have earned the right to steer his department as he sees fit. On foreign policy, Trump once said \u201cI\u2019m the only one that matters.\u201d He\u2019s made no such claim when it comes to military issues, seeming to treat the military brass as a breed apart. Trump early on moved to give his generals in the field -- from Afghanistan to Syria -- more direct authority over combat decisions.\nPentagon-State AllianceThe question now is whether Mattis will find Bolton and Pompeo chipping away at his powers. Mattis had a strong alliance with Tillerson -- they frequently coordinated their positions -- in a partnership that was a break from past tensions between the heads of the Pentagon and the State Department.\nNow, however, he finds himself surrounded by Cabinet members and advisers who disagree with his worldview, experienced bureaucratic insiders who enjoy the rough-and-tumble of Washington politics. Mattis is a firm believer in the so-called rules-based international order, under which the U.S. pays for the bulk of institutions such as the United Nations and NATO as a way of ensuring stability and maintaining its influence.\nOf course, there\u2019s never any guarantees in the Trump White House. The president has frequently proven quick to sour on top aides whose views he disagrees with, with almost half of his key advisers leaving since he took office.\n\u201cMattis is now more isolated,\u201d said Byron Callan, a defense markets and politics analyst in Washington for Capital Alpha Partners LLC. \u201cHe had kindred spirits in Tillerson and McMaster.\u201d\nTwo-Year TenuresIf Mattis were to leave this year, he\u2019d be the fourth consecutive defense secretary to do so after serving less than 24 months. Panetta, asked by President Barack Obama to shift over from the Central Intelligence Agency to the Pentagon, served less than two years, from July 2011 to February 2013.\nHis successor, former Republican Senator Chuck Hagel, lasted a little longer -- from February 2013 to February 2015. Hagel was succeeded by his deputy, Carter, who filled the position until January 2017.\nThose who know Mattis say that he will play a more important role than ever now, with Iran deal decision looming and the president\u2019s planned meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un coming as soon as May.\n\n        \n        \u201cTrump is the decider and while he is a saber rattler I think he is very reluctant to get into conflicts that are dangerous with people who can shoot back,\u201d said James Jeffrey, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Studies who was previously ambassador in Iraq, where Mattis commanded the 1st Marine Division during the most recent war.\nJeffrey said he expects Mattis to resist any effort by Bolton to encourage another war. Even if he pushes, Jeffrey said, the Pentagon chief \u201cwon\u2019t loan him an army to carry it out.\u201d\n\u2014 With assistance by Toluse Olorunnipa, and Margaret Talev", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Andrew Mayeda", "body": "President Donald Trump is taking his boldest step to level the economic playing field with China, ordering sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods in a move that could escalate already tense trade relations between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.\nThe president will instruct U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to levy tariffs on about $50 billion in Chinese imports, a senior White House official said. Trump is scheduled to sign an executive memo issuing the instructions on Thursday in Washington. Within 15 days, USTR will come up with a proposed list of products that will face higher tariffs.\nTrump will also direct Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to propose new investment restrictions on Chinese companies within 60 days to safeguard technologies the U.S. views as strategic, said senior White House economic adviser Everett Eissenstat.\n\n        \n        The move comes as policy makers across the world warn of a brewing trade war that could undermine the broadest global recovery in years. U.S. stocks fell sharply early Thursday amid worries that the U.S. action could provoke a stern response from China. Meanwhile, business groups representing companies ranging from Walmart Inc. to Amazon.com Inc. are warning U.S. tariffs could raise prices for consumers and sideswipe stock prices.\nFed WarningsEven central banks, which normally stay above the fray of trade spats, are weighing in. \u201cA number of participants reported about their conversations with business leaders around the country and reported that trade policy has become a concern,\u201d Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said this week, while cautioning that trade issues haven\u2019t changed the Fed\u2019s outlook. The Bank of England warned Thursday that increased protectionism could have a \u201csignificant negative impact\u201d on global growth.\nThe Trump administration is framing the move as a major turning point in U.S.-China relations. It followed a seven-month investigation by USTR into allegations China violates U.S. intellectual property, under the seldom-used section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. The U.S. concluded China engages in a range of violations, including policies that force American companies to transfer technology and the accessing of trade secrets through hacking, said Eissenstat.\nTrump\u2019s actions represent a \u201cseismic shift from an era dating back to Nixon and Kissinger, where we had as a government viewed China in terms of economic engagement,\u201d White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told reporters on Thursday. \u201cThat process has failed.\u201d\n\u201cThe problem is that with the Chinese in this case, talk is not cheap. It has been very expensive for America,\u201d said Navarro. \u201cFinally the president decided that we needed to move forward.\u201d\n\n        \n        Before the tariffs become final, there will be a 30-day comment period, the White House said. Trump is also directing his officials to pursue a World Trade Organization complaint against China for discriminatory licensing practices.\nIt will be Trump\u2019s first trade action directly aimed at China, which he has blamed for the hollowing out of the American manufacturing sector and the loss of U.S. jobs. The Trump administration is also increasingly signaling it will exclude allies such as the European Union and Brazil from tariffs on steel and aluminum that take effect Friday, suggesting the U.S. is more interested in raising pressure on China, the world\u2019s biggest producer of both commodities.\nChina WarningChina\u2019s Ministry of Commerce has cautioned against the U.S. taking measures \u201cdetrimental to both sides.\u201d The nation strongly opposes such unilateral and protectionist action, and will take \u201call necessary measures\u201d to firmly defend its interests, the ministry said in a statement on its website.\n\u201cIf Trump really signs the order, that is a declaration of trade war with China,\u201d said Wei Jianguo, former vice commerce minister and now an executive deputy director of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, a government-linked think tank.\nWhat Our Economists Say\n\u201c$50 billion in tariffs against China, if that is what the U.S. moves ahead with, is serious money. Even so, the impact on China\u2019s GDP would still be just a fraction of a percent off the growth rate,\u201d Tom Orlik, chief Asia economist for Bloomberg Economics, wrote in a note. \u201cThe greater risk comes to China\u2019s long-term development trajectory, if the rise of economic nationalism impedes their march up the value chain.\u201d\u201cChina is not afraid, nor will it dodge a trade war,\u201d Wei said. \u201cWe have plenty of measures to fight back, in areas of automobile imports, soybean, aircraft and chips. On the other hand, Trump should know that this is a very bad idea, and there will be no winner, and there will be no good outcome for both nations.\u201d\nChinese Premier Li Keqiang said this week that the nation will further open its economy, including the manufacturing sector, and pledged to lower import tariffs and cut taxes.

The revenue they\u2019ll raise won\u2019t come from China, but from the pockets of Americans who\u2019ll have to pay more for Chinese goods.\nImposing this tax requires a strong justification, or at least an intelligible rationale. The Trump administration offers neither. It\u2019s true that the U.S. has legitimate trade grievances with China, but there are much better ways of resolving them.\nThe White House says it will impose tariffs on $50 billion (or maybe $60 billion) of China\u2019s annual imports to the U.S. Not quite yet, though: Details will follow in 15 days, and there\u2019ll be 30 days for comments before any tariffs take effect. At the same time, the Treasury has been given 60 days to come up with new restrictions on investment by Chinese firms in the U.S.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        Maybe\u00a0Trump hopes these threats will lead China to make trade concessions and he will not need to actually put these tariffs in place. Conceivably, it could work out that way: Premier Li Keqiang said this week China will open its economy further, do more to protect intellectual property, and restrain its efforts to get foreign investors to transfer technology. If China follows through, that might be enough for Trump to declare victory and move on to his next adventure.\nThe danger is that Trump actually believes his own bombastic rhetoric about winning a trade war\u00a0-- that the time for talking is past, that China\u2019s promises are worthless, and that the administration will keep raising taxes on U.S. producers and consumers until the trade deficit with China is eliminated. That would be a lunatic growth-killing plan even if China didn\u2019t retaliate. If China did push back, and raised tariffs of its own against U.S. exports, the impact on both countries\u2019 growth would be worse.\nEven if it doesn\u2019t come to that, the other great cost of Trump\u2019s approach is the threat it poses to the rules-based system of liberal trade -- one designed and built over decades by none other than the U.S.\nThe president may be deluding himself that he can change China\u2019s behavior merely by bullying. A far better plan would be to bind an increasingly powerful China into this system as a matter of mutual advantage. This is a multilateral effort, involving the European Union and Japan, and it would be made more difficult by the unilateral rule-bending (or -breaking) that the Trump administration is proposing. How wise is it, really, to tell China, \u201cDo as you\u2019re told: Might is right\u201d?\nOn intellectual property and technology transfer, China is widely agreed to have done some rule-bending of its own. That does need to be addressed\u00a0-- and the existing system provides ways to do so. Oddly enough, the Trump administration acknowledges as much; it announced this week that the U.S. would launch a new case at the World Trade Organization on China\u2019s rules for licensing technology, and it has also relied on the expertise of CFIUS, the committee on foreign investment, to block deals on national-security grounds.\n\n        \n        Starting a trade war, however, is another matter entirely. That\u2019s a plan with a likelihood of high casualties for both sides. No one is arguing that Trump lacks the authority to prosecute such a war.

Trump must have known this, of course. But the president, a survivor to his core, had to find some novel way of explaining why he was trying to escape the clutches of an obstruction of justice investigation by obstructing justice. Trump's White House counsel, Donald McGahn, saw this overreach for exactly what it was and threatened to quit unless Trump backed down. And so Trump backed down, according to the Times.Let's not pretend, however, that the president will remain subdued for very long. All of this transpired last June. Since then, Mueller has indicted or secured guilty pleas from four former Trump insiders for a variety of crimes. He's conducting interviews with senior White House officials and a meeting with the president apparently is on the horizon. As the temperature of his investigation rises, expect the president to act out in increasingly volatile ways, and to stretch the boundaries of the law to counter Mueller's probe.What might that look like?Trump has the power to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the official overseeing Mueller's probe, if Rosenstein doesn't obey a request to fire Mueller. Trump could then tear through the Justice Department's senior ranks, firing people until he finds one who would comply with his demands.Although there's some debate among legal scholars about how much latitude the president\u00a0would have for such a\u00a0purge, Trump's previous maneuvering in this investigation suggests he believes he can do almost whatever he wants. That might explain why the Times report is surfacing now: Perhaps White House officials, perhaps even McGahn himself, are worried that the president is set again on toppling Mueller and they want to stop it (having the president safely tucked away in Switzerland and unable to counter-program probably helps).\n        \n        McGahn also has much on the line himself. Last January, he met with Sally Yates, the acting attorney general at the time, after she told him that Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had lied to the White House about his contacts with a Russian official. McGahn invited Yates back the next day and asked her why the Justice Department cared if White House officials were lying to one another. Yates said that it would possibly give the Russians leverage to blackmail Flynn. As it turned out, the White House knew for weeks that Flynn hadn't been truthful about his communications with Russia -- and neither McGahn nor Trump apparently felt concerned enough to force him out.If McGahn is now in Mueller's crosshairs, he might have decided that the simplest solution is to cooperate with the probe and turn over information in exchange for gentler treatment. In that scenario, McGahn becomes the source, directly or indirectly, of all kinds of interesting stuff for investigators and the media to ponder.As the White House gets rattled further, Trump will test how deeply Congress believes in and respects the rule of law. The U.S. legal system, whatever its imperfections, is a pillar of American life and liberty. Republicans and Democrats in Congress should remind themselves of that and prepare for the very real possibility that the president will try to fire the special counsel again\u00a0-- especially if Mueller's probe ensnares any of the Trumps, including the paterfamilias.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.To contact the author of this story:                Timothy L.

It would be reminiscent of the infamous 1973 \"Saturday Night Massacre\" when President Nixon fired the Watergate special prosecutor, causing his attorney general and deputy attorney general to resign in protest.\nFew in Washington expect Sessions to follow that course if similar actions were taken today.\nThere is crucial context both in why Rosenstein\u00a0took charge of the Russian investigation and the reasons for firing McCabe.\n\n        \n        The choice of Rosenstein, a respected U.S. attorney, was a calculated one. Sessions wanted to \u00a0pursue his ideological agenda -- anti-immigration, tough on crime and right-wing appointments -- while Rosenstein focused on managing the department and bringing expertise to criminal prosecutions.\nBut those plans were thwarted when Sessions was caught misleading the Senate in his confirmation hearings on his dealings with the Russians during the Trump campaign. Under pressure, he had to recuse himself from the Trump-Russia investigation. He also vowed to recuse himself from any matters involving the Hillary Clinton campaign or the Clinton Foundation.\nThat left Rosenstein to run\u00a0the Russia investigation. When Trump fired the FBI director for pursuing the Russia investigation, Rosenstein tapped Mueller as special counsel. That infuriated Trump, who has spent months threatening to fire Sessions for allowing this to happen. So the attorney general has tried to accommodate the White House at every other potential flashpoint, including the McCabe dismissal.\n\n        \n        McCabe was fired by Sessions for authorizing a leak in 2016 on the investigation into the Clinton Foundation and foreign money. He was also accused of lacking candor when interviewed by investigators.\u00a0But Sessions has not made public any part of the inquiry by the\u00a0department's inspector general, Michael Horowitz. Known as a straight shooter, he recommended\u00a0McCabe's dismissal. McCabe countered that his firing was really about trying to discredit Comey and Mueller investigation. McCabe has already appeared as a witness.\nTo fire him for leaks seems specious. First, the actual leak to the Wall Street Journal, contrary to Trump's assertion, suggested how McCabe was intent on pursuing a real investigation into the Clinton Foundation.\nLeaks, including pertaining to criminal inquiries, are common with the FBI. If Sessions wants a full-scale leak inquiry, he could start with Rudy Guiliani's friends in the New York office of the FBI. Their leaks against Hillary Clinton in the closing weeks of the 2016 campaign were calculated for maximum electoral damage. I once asked Oscar Goodman, a famous mob lawyer and later mayor of Las Vegas, how he won acquittals for some bad guys. \"Easy,\" he replied, \"FBI abuse,\" including leaks.\nThe irony of Sessions firing McCabe over a lack of candor\u00a0was put on full display on Wednesday, when\u00a0ABC News reported\u00a0that McCabe authorized an inquiry into Sessions' lack of candor before Congress; it was later closed.\u00a0If McCabe lied to FBI investigators about a leak he authorized, that would be grounds for dismissal. He denies this. The attorney general should release the IG's findings on McCabe immediately. \u00a0\nBoth Trump and his outside attorney, John Dowd, seized on the McCabe firing as a reason to end the Mueller inquiry. The president's in-house attorney, Ty Cobb, then insisted the president had no intention of firing Mueller. Then Trump hired lawyer Joe diGenova, a right-wing hit man who has criticized Rosenstein, Wray and Mueller.\nNo one knows what to expect from Trump when he feels threatened. But few believe Sessions would follow the brave example set by another attorney general\u00a0during a similarly dangerous moment for our democracy.\u00a0\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\nTo contact the author of this story:\n                Albert R.

Craker, Doblin likes to say, is the perfect flag bearer for the cause of medical marijuana production\u2014not remotely controversial and thus the ideal partner in a long and frustrating effort to loosen the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s chokehold on cannabis research. There are no counterculture skeletons in Craker\u2019s closet; only dirty boots and botany books. He\u2019s never smoked pot in his life, nor has he tasted liquor. \u201cI have Coca-Cola every once in a while,\u201d says the quiet, white-haired Craker, from a rolling chair in his basement office at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, where he\u2019s served as a professor in the Stockbridge School of Agriculture since 1967, specializing in medicinal and aromatic plants. He and his students do things such as subject basil plants to high temperatures to study the effects of climate change on what plant people call the constituents, or active elements.\nCraker first applied for a license to grow marijuana for medicinal research in 2001, at the urging of Doblin, the founder and executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), a nonprofit that advocates for research on therapeutic uses for LSD, MDMA (aka Ecstasy), marijuana, and other psychedelic drugs. Doblin, who has a doctorate in public policy, makes no secret of his own prior drug use. He\u2019s been lobbying since the 1980s for federal approval for clinical research trials on various psychedelics, and he saw marijuana as both a promising potential medicine and an important front in the public-relations war. Since 1970 marijuana has been a DEA Schedule I substance, meaning that in the view of the federal government, it\u2019s as dangerous as LSD, heroin, and Ecstasy, and has \u201cno currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\u201d\nRick Doblin, relentless advocate.\nPhotographer: Jonathan Schoonover for Bloomberg Businessweek\nBy that definition, pot\u2014now legal for medicinal use by prescription in 29 states and for recreational use in eight\u2014is more dangerous and less efficacious in the federal government\u2019s estimation than cocaine, oxycodone, or methamphetamine, all of which are classified Schedule II. Scientists and physicians are free to apply to the Food and Drug Administration and DEA for trials on Schedule I substances, and there are labs with licenses to produce LSD and Ecstasy for that purpose, but anyone who seeks to do FDA-approved research with marijuana is forced to obtain the plants from a single source: Uncle Sam. Specifically, since 1968 the DEA has allowed only one facility to legally cultivate marijuana for research studies, on a 10-acre plot at the University of Mississippi, funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and managed by the Ole Miss School of Pharmacy.\nThe NIDA license, Doblin says, is a \u201cmonopoly\u201d on the supply and has starved legitimate research toward understanding cannabinoids, terpenes, and other constituents of marijuana that seem to quell pain, stimulate hunger, and perhaps even fight cancer. Twice in the late 1990s, Doblin provided funding, PR, and lobbying support for physicians who wanted to study marijuana\u2014one sought a treatment for AIDS-related wasting syndrome, the other wanted to see if it helped migraines\u2014and was so frustrated by the experience that he vowed to break the monopoly. That\u2019s what led him to Craker.\nIn June 2001, Craker filed an application for a license to cultivate \u201cresearch-grade\u201d marijuana at UMass, with the goal of staging FDA-approved studies. Six months later he was told his application had been lost. He reapplied in 2002 and then, after an additional two years of no action, sued the DEA, backed by MAPS. By this point, both U.S. senators from Massachusetts had publicly supported his application, and a federal court of appeals ordered the DEA to respond, which it finally did, denying the application in 2004.\n\n        \n    \n\n    Craker appealed that decision with backing from a powerful bench of allies, including 40 members of Congress, and finally, in February 2007, a DEA administrative law judge ruled that his application for a license should be granted. The decision was not binding, however; it was merely a recommendation to the DEA leadership. Almost two years later, in the last week of the Bush administration, the application was rejected. Craker threw up his hands. He firmly believed marijuana should be more widely grown and studied, but he\u2019d lost any hope that it would happen in his lifetime. And he had basil to attend to.\nThen, in August 2016, during the final months of the Obama presidency, the DEA reversed course. It announced that, for the first time in a half-century, it would grant new licenses.\nDoblin, who has seemingly endless supplies of optimism and enthusiasm, convinced the professor there was hope\u2014again. So Craker submitted paperwork, again, along with 25 other groups. The university\u2019s provost co-signed his application, and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D\u2013Mass.) wrote a letter to the DEA in support of his effort.\nHe\u2019s still waiting to hear back. \u201cI\u2019m never gonna get the license,\u201d Craker says.\nPessimism isn\u2019t surprising from a man who\u2019s been making a reasonable case for 17 years to no avail. Studies around the world have shown that marijuana has considerable promise as a medicine. Craker says he spoke late last year at a hospital in New Hampshire where certain cannabinoids were shown to facilitate healing in brain-damaged mice. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018If cannabinoids could do that, let\u2019s put them in medicines!\u2019\u200a\u201d He sighs. \u201cWe can\u2019t do the research.\u201d\nAnother sigh. \u201cI\u2019m naive about a lot about things,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it seems to me that we should be looking at cannabis. I mean, if it\u2019s going to kill people, let\u2019s know that and get rid of it. If it\u2019s going to help people, let\u2019s know that and expand on it.\u2009\u2026\u2009But there\u2019s just something wrong with the DEA. I don\u2019t know what else to say.\u2009\u2026\u2009Somehow, marijuana\u2019s got a bad name. And it\u2019s tough to let go of.\u201d\nCraker\u00a0looks over some of the plants used in studies in the agriculture department\u2019s greenhouse at UMass.\nPhotographer: Jonathan Schoonover for Bloomberg Businessweek\nBack in 1990, Ethan Russo was a practicing neurologist who\u2019d grown frustrated with his pharmaceutical options. \u201cIt occurred to me I was giving increasingly toxic drugs to my patients with less and less benefit,\u201d says Russo, now one of the world\u2019s leading experts and advocates for research in marijuana medicine. \u201cIt caused me to go back to a childhood interest in medicinal plants and see if there were alternatives.\u201d\nIn 1996, when California became the first state to allow the use of marijuana by prescription, Russo saw an opening. With the support of\u2014who else\u2014Doblin and MAPS, he wrote a protocol and prepared for what he hoped would be a formal clinical trial using cannabis to treat migraines. Obviously, he\u2019d need to use NIDA-supplied marijuana. You can\u2019t do research acceptable to the FDA with marijuana grown illegally, as is all marijuana not grown at Ole Miss.\nNIDA twice rejected his applications to use its pot, but then the FDA assumed oversight of what it calls \u201cinvestigational new drug\u201d applications, and Russo got his approval. In the eyes of the FDA, his study was promising enough to warrant a clinical trial. \u201cWith any other drug, I would have been able to begin work on the trial the next day,\u201d he says. But the use of cannabis, and only cannabis, required a second \u201cpublic health service review,\u201d according to a rule instituted in 1998 to, ostensibly, facilitate more research. In reality, it did the opposite. NIDA denied Russo access to its cannabis. \u201cDespite the fact that the FDA had approved it,\u201d he says.\nAround the world, cannabis research was a growing field. Russo began to write and publish on the subject, and in 1998 he was recruited as a consultant by a British startup, GW Pharmaceuticals Plc, founded by two physicians who\u2019d been granted a license to cultivate cannabis by the U.K. Home Office, which oversees, among other things, security and drug policy.\n\n        \n    \n\n    In 2003, Russo joined GW full time, serving as medical monitor of clinical trials for two drugs developed from marijuana that GW grew: Sativex, for pain caused by cancer, and Epidiolex, for the treatment of severe seizure disorders. Phase III trials for both drugs were conducted in multiple countries, including the U.S. (The FDA doesn\u2019t have a problem with drugs derived from legal pot. It\u2019s just that in the U.S., the only federally legal pot is from Ole Miss.) Sativex is now available in every country in which trials were conducted except the U.S., where GW expects approval soon. \u201cBasically, I had begun working for a foreign company because of the impossibility of doing clinical work with cannabis in the United States,\u201d Russo says. \u201cAnd here we had a situation where a medicine, made from cannabis, that was manufactured in England, was able to be imported and tested. It was legally impossible to do the same thing based in the U.S.\u201d GW has a market value of more than $2 billion and a robust drug development pipeline.\nDoblin\u2019s ultimate goal isn\u2019t to compete with GW Pharmaceuticals. Should the NIDA monopoly ever end, he says, a number of companies will surely want to grow marijuana \u201cto make extracts in nonsmoking delivery systems that can be patented\u201d\u2014that is, pharmaceuticals. This is a good thing, in his estimation. \u201cBut MAPS is focused on developing a low-cost generic plant in bud form,\u201d he says. In other words, he wants specific varieties of marijuana, not derivatives thereof, to be FDA-approved.\nMany people expect the Republican-controlled Congress to follow its recent tax overhaul by looking for ways to slash costs in Medicaid and Medicare. Legitimate research into the medicinal properties of marijuana could help. Studies show that opioid use drops significantly in states where marijuana has been legalized; this suggests people are consuming the plant for pain, something they could be doing more effectively if physicians and the FDA controlled chemical makeup and potency. A study published in July 2016 in Health Affairs showed that the use of prescription drugs for which marijuana could serve as a clinical alternative \u201cfell significantly,\u201d saving hundreds of millions of dollars among users of Medicare Part D.\n\u201cThe marijuana plant in bud form, if we can get it available by the FDA, is going to be incredibly cheap,\u201d Doblin says. His Israeli partners, Better by Cann Pharmaceuticals, can produce organic, high-potency trimmed marijuana for roughly 65\u00a2 a gram, or $18 or so per ounce. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about kicking people off of health insurance and reducing Medicare and Medicaid costs, we better find a way to provide medical relief to people at a low cost,\u201d he says.\n\n        \n    \n\n    Every year the percentage of Americans who favor legalization of marijuana climbs. Last year it topped 60 percent for the first time. A remarkable 94 percent support medical use. \u201cAnd businesses outside of the country are already making billions of dollars,\u201d Doblin says. Canada, the Netherlands, and Israel all have booming cannabis research sectors; in Israel, some of the work is government-funded. \u201cWe have enormous opportunity that we\u2019re squandering as a country to reduce health-care costs, build businesses, and create jobs,\u201d he says.\nRusso agrees. He now lives in Washington state consulting for several biotech startups working on cannabis projects. \u201cLet\u2019s face facts: This is a very technologically advanced nation with a great deal of talent. There is no way, shape, or form that the dangers of cannabis warrant this kind of control,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are issues. There are side effects. Anyone who tells you differently is simply inaccurate. However, the kinds of problems related to cannabis administration are totally controllable. And it is a much safer drug than many, if not most, pharmaceuticals that are currently being approved.\u201d\nHe\u2019d just returned from an industry conference in Medell\u00edn, Colombia. \u201cI think that there\u2019s a greater chance of significant clinical cannabis research coming out of Colombia in the coming years than there is in the U.S.,\u201d Russo says. \u201cWhy would people allow this loss of business in a situation where, clearly, Americans could be preeminent?\u201d\nAmong those who\u2019ve advised Craker is Tony Coulson, a former DEA agent who retired in 2010 and works as a consultant for companies developing drugs. Coulson was vehemently antimarijuana until his son, a combat soldier, came home from the Middle East with post-traumatic stress disorder and needed help. \u201cFor years I was of the belief that the science doesn\u2019t say that this is medicine,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when you get into this curious history, you find the science doesn\u2019t show it primarily because we\u2019re standing in the way. The NIDA monopoly prevents anyone from getting into further studies.\u201d\nCoulson blames the Obama administration for not acting sooner, creating a situation in which the decision on granting new growing licenses was passed down to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has publicly declared his belief in the dangers of marijuana. The NIDA monopoly is now his to change. \u201cSessions has a 1930s Reefer Madness view of the marijuana world,\u201d Coulson says. \u201cIt\u2019s not realistic, and it\u2019s not what rank-and-file DEA really are concerned about. DEA folks have moved beyond this.\u201d\n\u201cI guess I take a nationalist approach here,\u201d says Rick Kimball, a former investment banker who\u2019s raising money for a marijuana-related private equity fund and is a trustee for marijuana policy at the Brookings Institution. \u201cWe have a huge opportunity in the U.S.,\u201d he says, \u201cand we ought to get our act together. I\u2019m worried that we\u2019re ceding this whole market to the Israelis.\u201d\nFrom left: Craker in his lab; inspecting samples of grass being grown in a cooler.\nPhotographer: Jonathan Schoonover for Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhich doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no intellectual property left to grab. Research into the chemical makeup of marijuana is still new, but there are at least 160 cannabinoids and as many as 500 terpenes and flavonoids in the plant, all of which can be separated out, mixed, and matched. CBN is thought to aid sleep. CBG may have anticancer potential. One Israeli researcher has synthesized 22 different versions of THC to treat specific neurological conditions. \u201cThere\u2019s reason to believe there\u2019s a cornucopia of medicines in there,\u201d Kimball says\u2014medicines that, in theory, are patentable.\nAt foreign labs, and even at state-licensed operations in Colorado and Washington, plant scientists are growing genetically modified varieties that optimize for certain properties. The majority of their work is focused on increasing potency for recreational use\u2014getting people high\u2014but these companies are learning how to cultivate and engineer plants using increasingly sophisticated methods.\nMeanwhile, Mahmoud ElSohly, director of the Marijuana Project at Ole Miss, is growing limited varieties, outdoors, while trying to keep undergrads from breaching his security. (At one point, students were caught using fly rods to cast over the fence and steal buds.) It took ElSohly three years to get DEA permission to grow a strain high in CBD, a nonpsychoactive cannabinoid thought to have many healthful properties. The key ingredient in GW Pharmaceutical\u2019s epilepsy drug, it may have promise as an anti-inflammatory and antipsychotic.\n\u201cI am the most restricted person in this country when it comes to production of cannabis and different varieties,\u201d ElSohly says. \u201cIn Colorado and Washington or any other state where people don\u2019t have to get any approval from anybody, they just do it. They have the freedom to experiment. I don\u2019t have that freedom. My hands are tied. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\nIt appears that none of the 25 applications to grow marijuana for purposes of medical research have gone anywhere. (The DEA won\u2019t comment on this or release the names of the applicants.) Craker has yet to get a single call or email about his methods or motivations. No agent has come to inspect his facility or ask questions about security.\nHe marvels at the power of bureaucratic inertia: \u201cThe federal government can be so stubborn. To me they\u2019ve closed their minds.\u201d Craker can\u2019t grow marijuana, but he does lecture about it in his plant medicine classes. \u201cI go through the scenario of what we\u2019ve tried to do,\u201d he says. Ultimately, he says, some of those students may have to do the work he\u2019s been wanting to do for 20 years. \u201cMy generation has passed, and we haven\u2019t made it. But it\u2019s going to happen.

For almost an hour, the ex-coal executive and ex-con reads off a teleprompter, doing his best impression of a political candidate. For a big man, Blankenship has a\u00a0surprisingly soft voice. His message\u00a0is anything but. He talks of his years of union-busting, the twin evils of illegal immigration and opioid addiction\u2014blaming the first for causing the second\u2014and the folly of environmental regulation.\nThroughout, he never strays far from the true target of his ire: Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. Blankenship blames Manchin not only for much of what\u2019s wrong with West Virginia, but also for helping put him behind bars.\u00a0\nSenator Joe Manchin.\nPhotographer: Alex Brandon/AP Photo\nIn 2016, the former hard-charging chief executive officer of Massey Energy Co. went to federal prison for conspiring to evade safety laws in the lead-up to the worst coal mine disaster in a generation\u2014a 2010 explosion at Upper Big Branch Mine that killed 29 miners. Manchin, the governor at the time, commissioned an independent probe that reached blistering conclusions about Blankenship\u2019s tight grip over Massey and did a lot to seal public opinion about his role in the disaster.\nYears later, as federal prosecutors zeroed in on Blankenship, Manchin, by then a senator, said on national TV that the ex-coal boss had \u201cblood on his hands.\u201d\nDuring his year in prison, Blankenship maintained his innocence, even issuing a press release blaming the federal government for the explosion and referring to himself as a political prisoner. The day he got out in May 2017, he began tweeting insults at Manchin, accusing him of lying about the causes of the explosion and challenging him to a debate. Manchin said he hoped Blankenship would disappear from the public eye. Instead, Blankenship declared his candidacy for Manchin\u2019s seat.\n\u201cDon Blankenship has entered this race because he has an ax to grind with Joe Manchin,\u201d says Mike Caputo, Democratic minority whip of the West Virginia House of Delegates. \u201cIt\u2019s more personal than politics.\u201d\n\n        \n    \n\n    Before he can face Manchin, Blankenship has to get through the Republican primary on May \u202f8. His two main challengers, Evan Jenkins, the congressman who represents the state\u2019s southern coalfields, and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, are more polished politicians than Blankenship. But it\u2019s not clear that this matters. Their early polling lead has withered in the face of Blankenship barnstorming the state and spending millions of his money. A survey commissioned in early March by Jenkins shows him just two points ahead of Blankenship, who a month ago was a distant third. That\u2019s now where Morrisey sits.\u00a0\nAll three are trying to align themselves with the Trump agenda\u2014a smart move in West Virginia, where Trump\u2019s 61\u202fpercent approval rating is the highest of any state. But Blankenship can lay a truer claim to the sort of positions that got Trump elected. That\u2019s because in many ways, Blankenship blazed the trail Trump rode to the presidency, having spent years railing against free trade and government over-reach in his role as the state\u2019s most powerful coal executive.\nTo understand Blankenship\u2019s appeal\u00a0is to understand the current conservative movement in rural America, and how, in the span of several years, West Virginia became one of the reddest states in the country after decades as a Democratic enclave. \u00a0Asked to describe his politics, Blankenship says simply: \u201cI don\u2019t believe in liberal causes because I think liberalism is too close to socialism, and that\u2019s been proven to fail around the world.\u201d\nFor generations of politicians, the key constituent force in West Virginia was the organized labor movement. No one wielded that power better than Robert Byrd, a New Deal Democrat whose 51-year tenure in the U.S. Senate is the longest ever. Today, Byrd is remembered as the masterful rainmaker who, as chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, steered billions of federal dollars into the state, as evidenced by the scores of roads, bridges, and buildings that bear his name. Upon Byrd\u2019s death in 2010, Manchin took over his seat\u00a0and then won it outright in 2012.\u00a0\nThe Upper Big Branch Miners Memorial in Whitesville, W. Va., is dedicated to 29 coal miners who died in a\u00a02010 explosion.\u00a0\nPhotographer: Andrew Lichtenstein/Getty Images\nBy the 1980s, labor was losing its clout around the country. Blankenship, then a fast-climbing accountant at Massey, did as much as anyone to speed its decline in West Virginia. When Massey refused to sign a new union contract in 1984, it kicked off a 15-month strike by the United Mine Workers of America. Blankenship led the effort to keep Massey mines open, bringing\u00a0in non-unionized workers and leading to spats of violence that left one non-union truck driver dead, and bullet holes in Blankenship\u2019s office walls and car. Ultimately, Massey won, delivering the first of many blows to West Virginia\u2019s union base.\nBlankenship eventually became CEO and\u00a0chairman of Massey. By the early 2000s, he began spending millions of his own money getting Republicans elected to state office, including $3\u202fmillion in 2004 to defeat a pro-labor state Supreme Court judge. His power peaked on Labor Day 2009, when, on the top of a mountain that had been leveled for coal mining, to a crowd of tens of thousands, Blankenship delivered a broadside against his many enemies: the federal government, environmentalists, and companies that send jobs overseas. Clad in an American flag hat and shirt, he gave a performance that in hindsight seems torn from the page of a Trump stump speech, right down to the phrase \u201cmaking America great\u201d and\u00a0invective\u00a0against government regulation. \u201cI know that the safety and health of coal miners is my most important job,\u201d Blankenship said. \u201cI don\u2019t need Washington politicians to tell me that, and neither do you.\u201d\nSeven months later, Upper Big Branch exploded.\nProtesters hold signs as Blankenship (front left) prepares to testify at a hearing in Washington on coal mining safety in May 2010.\nPhotographer: Alex Wong/Getty Images\nSoon, Blankenship was being hauled before Congressional committees and being held personally accountable by men he regarded as political foes.\u00a0That included Robert Byrd. In a particularly heated exchange\u00a0in May 2010, Byrd, then 92, sparred with Blankenship during a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. \u201cThis is a clear record of blatant disregard for the welfare and safety of Massey miners,\u201d Byrd said. \u201cShame!\u201d he called out at Blankenship. It was among the last public appearances by Byrd. He\u00a0was dead a month later.\nDespite the deaths associated with Upper Big Branch,\u00a0to a lot of West Virginians, Blankenship is more martyr than villain. Even in the state\u2019s southern coalfields, where the disaster ruined so many lives, many miners associate him with better economic times, when the state\u2019s coal production was three times higher than it is today. Though Massey was sold in\u202f2011, it\u2019s not uncommon to see people wearing old jackets and hats emblazoned with the company logo. On a February morning in Mingo County, miners coming off the overnight shift streamed into a small gas station convenience store, wearing their old Massey Energy jackets. Buying a hot sandwich before heading home to sleep, Terry Maynard, 46, acknowledges he doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019ll vote in November, but he isn\u2019t ruling out his old boss. \u201cEvery coal miner I\u2019ve talked to, you don\u2019t ever hear Don Blankenship get blamed for Upper Big Branch,\u201d he says. \u00a0\nThough he spent much of his career fighting\u00a0against\u00a0organized labor,\u00a0Blankenship has tapped into the anger of working people in West Virginia and their deep frustration over the state\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0stagnant economy. It\u2019s consistently at the bottom in terms of job creation, along with most other measures of prosperity. In 2016, it had the country\u2019s highest rate of drug overdose deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While these issues have long festered, the sense of exasperation has mounted in the past decade as the state\u2019s coal production fell by nearly half, pressured\u00a0by the slowdown of China\u2019s economy and also the rise of cheap natural gas from America\u2019s shale formations.\n\n        \n    \n\n    To feel the impact, you can zip down the Robert Byrd Freeway south of Charleston and drive to Mingo County, one of America\u2019s poorest regions and the childhood homd of Blankenship.\u00a0Near the highway exit to\u00a0the town of Williamson, population\u00a02,900, two giant signs hang\u00a0from the side of a building:\u00a0\u201cLEGALIZE COAL,\u201d says one. \u201cTRUMP,\u201d says the other.\nWhile he\u2019s popular with the base, Blankenship makes most establishment Republicans nervous, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who recently said he didn\u2019t want to see Blankenship as the GOP standard-bearer against Manchin. Blankenship\u2019s campaign staff practically delights in how uncomfortable they make such people. \u201cThe Mitch McConnells of the world will say, \u2018This is risky,\u2019\u201d says Greg Thomas, Blankenship\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cHe\u2019s been public in the past about this\u2014Don doesn\u2019t think Mitch McConnell should be in the Senate.\u201d\nManchin\u00a0may actually welcome Blankenship as his opponent. In an impromptu interview on Capitol Hill, Manchin chuckles when asked about\u00a0Blankenship\u2019s attempt to unseat him. \u201cHe\u2019ll have to join a crowd,\u201d he says. Although he\u2019s among the most endangered Senate Democrats up for reelection\u2014and the only West Virginia Democrat in Washington\u2014Manchin\u2019s prospects shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. He\u2019s out-raised the rest of the field, with $3.6 million by Dec.\u00a031. Manchin is also a natural campaigner, with a gift for shaking hands, kissing babies and remembering names. Voters feel as if they know him. Manchin\u00a0has been a politician for more than 35 years, going back to his time in the West Virginia House of Delegates in the early 1980s.\u00a0\nOver the years, Manchin has been able to morph into the kind of Democrat who can survive in a state that has gotten increasingly more red\u00a0during his time in office. He\u2019s distanced himself from the more progressive elements of the party and is culturally and politically attuned to West Virginia. In 2010, he famously ran an ad where he shot a version of Barack Obama\u2019s cap and trade bill with a rifle. Since Trump was elected, Manchin\u2019s been careful to focus on practical issues such as pension benefits for miners, rather than on political crusades such as immigration. That\u2019s at times drawn the ire of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate, which could end up being a plus.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that Manchin is an incumbent, and he will be hard to beat,\u201d says Bill Bissett, president of the Huntington\u00a0 Regional Chamber of Commerce.\u00a0\u201cBut at the same time, this is a volatile political climate, and it\u2019s going to be very interesting times in West Virginia.\u201d\u00a0\n\n        \n    \n\n    In recent years, Republicans took control of both branches of the state legislature for the first time since the Great Depression. The new GOP establishment is turning up the heat on Manchin. Billionaire Governor Jim Justice, himself a coal magnate from the state's southern coalfields, got elected in 2016 as a rare Democrat, then changed party affiliation last summer at a rally alongside a visiting Donald Trump. On March 14, after weeks of high-profile teacher strikes, Justice fired his Secretary of Education and the Arts\u2014Gayle Manchin, the senator's wife.\nWhile Justice acceded to the state's shifting political identity, Manchin is looking to tap West Virginia\u2019s once-dependable reservoir of Democratic support. Even today, 43\u00a0percent of the state\u2019s registered voters are Democrats, compared with just 32\u00a0percent Republicans. He may get help from such down-ticket friends as Richard Ojeda, a retired U.S. Army officer who was Manchin\u2019s guest at President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address in 2013. Ojeda, a state senator, is running for Jenkins\u2019s seat in Congress and has gained a strong following, particularly as he rallied with striking West Virginia teachers. As a state senator, Ojeda\u00a0has sponsored bills to legalize medical marijuana, championed Planned Parenthood, and pushed for pay raises for teachers and other public employees. In a sign of the delicate politics of West Virginia, however, Ojeda voted for Trump over Clinton in 2016.\u00a0In West Virginia, even some of the staunchest Democrats voted for Trump.\nWhen it comes to Blankenship though, Ojeda is no fan and can help in the\u00a0attack should Blankenship defy the odds and\u00a0become Manchin\u2019s opponent. \u201cDon Blankenship is a toxic leader,\u201d Ojeda says. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run for office.\u201d\nAs the primaries approach, Blankenship has continued to crisscross the state with town halls and buy up radio and TV ads, which\u00a0his opponents simply aren\u2019t doing.\u00a0Bissett, of the\u00a0Huntington chamber, says that by self-financing, Blankenship has freed himself from spending time, energy, and influence attending fundraisers, unlike Morrisey and Jenkins.\u00a0Greg Thomas, Blankenship\u2019s campaign manager, has a different explanation. The establishment wing of the GOP is looking for someone safe, he says, but Blankenship\u2019s surging popularity suggests the voters want someone more aggressive. \u201cWe have to identify as the person who\u2019s gonna take on Joe Manchin,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cWho in the world would get out of prison, be on probation, and run for Senate against the people who put him in jail?\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Erik Wasson", "body": "The House passed a $1.3 trillion spending bill that would avert a government shutdown and increase funding for the military, border security and other domestic programs, though two GOP senators who oppose the measure haven\u2019t said whether they\u2019ll force a delay past a Friday funding deadline and cause a closure.\nIn 256-167 vote on Thursday, the House sent the compromise measure to the Senate, which is expected to act on Friday.

Asked about the rushed process to consider the legislation, Ryan told reporters, \"By and large we\u2019ve done a phenomenal job\" in following House rules. \nThe proposal includes $1.6 billion for border security, including money for fencing and levees, though that\u2019s only a fraction of the $25 billion that Trump wanted to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\n        \n        The compromise spending proposal, unveiled after repeated delays and all-night bargaining sessions, has a provision creating incentives to bolster reporting by federal agencies to the database for gun-buyer background checks, as well as $21 billion for infrastructure projects and an additional $4 billion to combat opioid addiction.\nNew York\u2019s Nita Lowey, the top spending panel Democrat, said on the House floor that the measure \u201crepudiates the abysmal Trump budget,\" which sought $54 billion in cuts to domestic spending.\nRyan delivered a summary of the spending legislation to Trump at the White House Wednesday afternoon. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky joined the meeting, which included Vice President Mike Pence, by telephone.\nHudson River TunnelOne of the biggest obstacles to reaching the agreement was the status of funding for a Hudson River tunnel between New York and New Jersey. Advocates, mainly Democrats and Republicans representing the two states, argued it is one of the most important infrastructure projects in the U.S. But Trump has insisted on removing money for the project, known as Gateway, from the spending plan.\nThe spending agreement omits language steering money to the Gateway project, although the project could access about half the funds supporters are seeking -- as much as $541 million -- through other accounts, one congressional aide said. Additional funding would be available to the project through Amtrak and grants that don\u2019t require approval from the U.S. Department of Transportation, the aide said.\nThe legislation includes several provisions in response to mass shootings.

Fleeing war-torn China for Hong Kong in 1940, Li found factory work while also caring for his ailing father, who soon died from tuberculosis. By the time he was a teenager, Li was working 16 hours a day at a plastics trading company.\nAfter the war, Li made his first fortune as a manufacturer of plastic flowers. His career as property mogul began in the late 1950s when, unable to renew his lease, he bought the site of his factory.\nPolitical ConnectionsIn the years to come, Li invested in local real estate as others sold, most notably in 1967, when riots inspired by Mao Zedong\u2019s Cultural Revolution in China rocked Hong Kong and sent property prices plunging.\nHis most symbolic coup as a businessman may have come in 1979, when he bought control of trading house Hutchison Whampoa from Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. Li quietly negotiated with the bank, now called HSBC Holdings Plc, to buy Hutchison shares for less than half their book value. HSBC agreed and Li became the first person of Chinese origin to own one of the British-founded companies that had dominated the local economy since the colony\u2019s founding in 1841.\nThat reputation helped Li make inroads in China, where he mixed extensive political connections with financial interests. Li was a senior adviser to the Chinese government on Britain\u2019s 1997 handover of Hong Kong and served on the committee that drafted the Basic Law, the city\u2019s mini-constitution under Chinese rule.\n16-Hour WorkdayClose Chinese ties had their downside too, particularly in the U.S., as critics including former President Ronald Reagan\u2019s defense secretary to ex-Republican Senate leader Trent Lott voiced concerns about Li\u2019s relationship with China -- allegations denied by Li\u2019s camp.

He helped Trump steer tax cuts into law last year but proved unpersuasive on trade, where Cohn was a stark counterpoint to nationalists and economic populists in the administration led by former chief strategist Stephen Bannon.\nHis departure may cause further turbulence in financial markets, where investors saw him as a steady hand in an otherwise unpredictable administration.

He had planned to bring in executives from U.S. companies that depend on the metals to meet this week with Trump to make the case that the tariffs will cost more jobs than they save and damage the U.S. economy, according to two people familiar with the plan. The meeting was canceled Tuesday, according to another person.\nTrump had told advisers he believed Cohn would quit if the tariff plan went ahead, said people familiar with the matter.\nTrump reiterated his determination to proceed with the tariffs at the Tuesday press conference, brushing aside threats of retaliation from the European Union.\n\n        \n        \u201cWhen we\u2019re behind every single country, trade wars aren\u2019t so bad,\u201d Trump said Tuesday in a press conference at the White House with Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven. \u201cThe trade war hurts them, not us.\u201d\nCohn appeared on the verge of leaving the White House as early as August, in the aftermath of violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, between white supremacists and counter-protesters. Trump\u2019s contention that there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d of the conflict, in which one counter-protester was killed, drew widespread condemnation -- including from Cohn, who is Jewish.\n\u201cI believe this administration can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning these groups and do everything we can to heal the deep divisions that exist in our communities,\u201d Cohn told the Financial Times.\nAt the time, Cohn said he was reluctant to leave his position \u201cbecause I feel a duty to fulfill my commitment to work on behalf of the American people.\u201d He said later that he decided to stay in the administration in part to help win passage of the tax law Trump signed in December.\n\u201cThe amount of impact that we can have on the U.S. economy and U.S. citizens and changing the forward outlook of the United States -- this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I would never miss this,\u201d he said.\nCohn grew up in the Cleveland suburb of Shaker Heights, grandson of a Polish immigrant, son of an electrician who became a real estate developer. On a day off from an early job selling window frames and aluminum siding, Cohn shared a ride to the airport with a trader, according to a commencement address he gave in 2009 at his alma mater, American University in Washington. The man said he needed someone to help trade options, and Cohn talked his way into the job.\nHe became an independent silver trader on Comex in 1983, and seven years later was hired by the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. commodities unit J. Aron. Not long after, Lloyd Blankfein took over the division; Cohn became Blankfein\u2019s deputy in 1996. They spent two decades at each other\u2019s side.\nWhen Blankfein was promoted to chairman and chief executive officer in 2006, Cohn went with him as president and chief operating officer. They were the only two executives on the Goldman Sachs board.\nThroughout those years, Cohn was regarded both inside the firm and outside as a man who pushed hard.\n\u201cIf there is one thing out of this on how to stand out, it\u2019s take risks,\u201d Cohn said in the commencement address. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve done in my career, and everything that most of you have done to this point, is to take risks.\u201d\nCohn\u2019s aggressiveness helped keep Goldman Sachs on top of the Wall Street pecking order, where it became the most profitable securities firm in history. For his work in 2007, he was rewarded with a $67.5 million pay package. The next year, the U.S. economy nearly collapsed, and Congress fixed part of the blame on Goldman Sachs.\nCohn was seen by some as too abrasive to lead Goldman Sachs despite his efforts to soften his style. When Blankfein announced in September 2015 that he had cancer, Cohn took over some of the CEO\u2019s client and traveling duties. But it was clear by the summer of 2016 that Blankfein wasn\u2019t going to step down, and by the end of the year it was Cohn who was out.\nTrump treated Goldman Sachs as a punching bag on the campaign trail, but he relied on people with connections to the bank after he won the White House. During the transition, Cohn visited Trump Tower, stepping into the role of what some have described as Trump\u2019s personal investment banker. He helped vet potential financial regulator picks, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s Christopher Giancarlo and Fed Vice Chairman Randal Quarles.\n\u2014 With assistance by Jennifer Jacobs", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "The Editors", "body": "The National Rifle Association has long offered its expertise in politics and public relations to gun groups in Australia, Brazil, Canada and elsewhere.

In recent years the NRA has developed relationships with several well-connected Russians, including Alexander Torshin, an ally of President Vladimir Putin who is deputy governor of the Russian central bank.Torshin, who has been implicated in money laundering by Spanish authorities, is also an NRA member. In 2016 he is reported to have met with Donald Trump Jr. at the NRA\u2019s annual meeting in Kentucky, and in 2015 NRA leaders met with Torshin in Moscow.\n        \n        \n        \n        The NRA has said that the FBI has not contacted it about Russian funds. Curiously, however, the gun group has so far failed to take the simple step of denying that it accepted Russian money at all. The NRA reported spending more than $55 million in the 2016 election, including $30 million on Trump\u00a0-- more than the organization has spent on any candidate in its history.Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee, has sent letters to the U.S. Treasury Department and to the NRA requesting information on the group\u2019s ties to Putin allies. Committee chairman Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, should do the same.The public has the right to know if the NRA served as a backdoor for Putin\u2019s sabotage of the election -- especially given the NRA\u2019s role in lobbying Congress and state governments, and funding political campaigns. Did the NRA receive any money from Russia-linked individuals or entities? Did it facilitate meetings between Russians and members of the Trump campaign? To what end?As a 501(c)(4) organization, the NRA is not required to disclose its donors. Congress should change that law. Regardless, thorough answers from the NRA to each of these questions could resolve any doubts about its conduct, even if they also show that the group chooses its friends poorly.Russia's sabotage of the 2016 election was an attack on American democracy.

Lawmakers routinely ignore the spending requests required annually from the executive branch. And Congress passed its own spending bill on Friday, which the president signed.\n        \n        The White House document also proposes an increase in defense spending and earmarks $200 billion for the infrastructure proposal the administration plans to unveil alongside the fiscal year 2019 budget, as well as new regulatory cuts.$1 Trillion DeficitsMonday\u2019s document will outline proposed spending reforms the administration says would, in enacted, cut deficits over the next decade -- even as recently passed tax legislation and spending caps threaten to drive future annual deficits above $1 trillion.\u201cJust like every American family, the budget makes hard choices: fund what we must, cut where we can, and reduce what we borrow,\u201d Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s with respect for the hard work of the American people that we spend their tax dollars efficiently, effectively, and with accountability.\u201dA year ago, Trump asked lawmakers to cut $3.6 trillion in federal spending over the next ten years, and identified deep cuts to domestic spending programs. Instead, lawmakers last week passed a two-year government funding deal that would boost military and non-defense spending by $300 billion over the next two years and add more than $80 billion in disaster relief.But administration officials argue their proposals, dead on arrival though they may be, is still an important marker of the president\u2019s legislative priorities.Immigration Enforcement\n        \n        The plan includes a heavy emphasis on immigration enforcement. Trump is requesting $782 million to hire 2,750 new border and immigration officers, and $2.7 billion to detain people in the country illegally. Trump is also asking for $18 billion over the next two fiscal years toward the goal of constructing a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. That\u2019s a key point of contention in the ongoing legislative battle over the fate of young people, known as \u201cDreamers,\u201d who were brought to the country illegally as children.The proposal also includes $13 billion in new funding to combat the opioid epidemic, which Trump has frequently cited as among his top domestic priorities. The administration would provide a $3 billion boost to the Department of Health and Human Services in the next fiscal year, and $10 billion in 2019.The proposal takes \u201cmoney that the Democrats want to put to these social programs and move it to things like infrastructure, move it to things like opioid relief, move it to things that are in line with the president\u2019s priorities so that if it does get spent, at least it get spent to the right places,\u201d Mulvaney said Sunday during an appearance on Fox News.Boost for VeteransOther elements include $85.5 billion in discretionary funding for veterans health services, education, and vocational rehabilitation, the OMB said on Sunday. It is not clear how much of that funding would represent an increase from current spending levels.The budget also includes $200 billion in federal funds over the next decade that the White House says would spur $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending through partnerships with state and local governments and private developers. That includes $21 billion over the next two years that the White House says would \u201cjump start key elements of the infrastructure initiative.\u201dTrump will discuss the public works proposal on Monday with governors, mayors, state legislators and other officials, and he expects to meet with Congressional leaders from both parties at the White House on Feb. 14.

They try to clearly spell out the kinds of remarks and other posts that won't be tolerated in special sections such as one Facebook, the largest online social network, has set up. Instagram, a popular service among kids and young adults for sharing photos and videos, provides links to the U.S. government's anti-bullying site and tips from a cyberbullying research center on one of its help pages.\n\nBut the efforts so far have fallen short, leading to rampant abuses that even some of the companies acknowledge have driven away or tormented portions of their audience.\n\nIt got so bad on Twitter, which has 68 million U.S. users, that the San Francisco company vowed last fall to crack down on hateful tweets. Among other things, Twitter adopted new policies aimed at protecting women who unknowingly or unwillingly had nude pictures of themselves distributed online \u2014 a common bullying tactic.\n\nYik Yak, another messaging app once popular among high school and college students, shut down last year partly because schools banned it following complaints about bullying and harassment.\n\nOnline bullying takes many shapes, but some of the most common tactics include posting embarrassing or salacious photos, making demeaning or cruel remarks under a photo or in a general post about someone, and sharing screenshots of what at least one person thought was a private text.\n\n\n        \n        Harassment is widespread and extends beyond teenagers. A Pew Research Center poll last year found 41 percent of U.S. adults believed they had been harassed online.\n\nThe popularity and volume of content on major social media sites presents a huge challenge in policing what is being shared. Facebook, for instance, has 2.1 billion worldwide users who collectively share billions of posts on their pages daily. More than 300 hours of video is uploaded to Google's YouTube site every minute.\n\nThe companies are also constantly struggling to balance the desire to prevent harassment and other abuses and maintain a commitment to freedom of expression.\n\nIn some cases, they see harassment and still look the other way. For instance, some of President Trump's more vitriolic tweets have openly mocked and denigrated people, prompting calls for Twitter to shut down his account and ban him from its service. But Twitter has declined, maintaining the news value of the president's tweets eclipse complaints about him being a bully.\n\nThere is no federal law that applies to bullying. State laws vary, ranging from requiring public schools to have a bullying policy to requiring anonymous reporting systems, said Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University. The federal government can best help by giving schools more tools and money to provide programs, Hinduja said.\n\nMrs. Trump announced in a speech near the end of the 2016 presidential campaign that her priority as first lady would be to fight cyberbullying. A native of Slovenia, she at the time lamented a U.S. culture that she said had grown \"too mean and too rough.\" It was a curious speech for a woman whose husband uses Twitter to dismiss people as losers and taunt them with unflattering nicknames.\n\nThe mother of a 12-year-old son, the first lady has made child well-being her focus in the White House, including an unexpected interest in how the opioid crisis is affecting youngsters.\n\n\n        \n        She has visited hospitals and care centers to see the effects first hand, and has embraced parents whose children died from drug overdoses.

The indictment alleges that the operation was funded to the tune of $1.25 million a month by companies controlled by a Russian businessman close to the Kremlin.Photographer: Andrew Harrer/BloombergThe indictment means that Trump can no longer credibly cast doubt on alleged Russian election meddling.

It represents a fundamental shift. The U.S. intelligence community\u2019s assertions that Russia interfered in the election, based on classified evidence never revealed to the public, was easily dismissed by Trump and his allies.

Federal prosecutors are investigating the business practices of RWC Group LLC, which owns Kalashnikov USA\u2019s plant in Pompano Beach, a person familiar with the investigation said.\nIt\u2019s unclear which business practices are under investigation, and a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Miami declined to confirm or deny any probe. Representatives for the company didn\u2019t respond to repeated requests for comment, but a top executive for RWC Group and Kalashnikov USA has said the manufacturer is doing nothing wrong.\n\n        \n        Nonetheless, the company\u2019s past links to Russia -- and its storied state arms maker Kalashnikov Concern JSC -- have drawn increasing scrutiny in the weeks since the Feb. 14 mass shooting at a high school in nearby Parkland, Florida. RWC Group became Kalashnikov\u2019s sole U.S. distributor in 2012, and the Russian company planned to sell 200,000 guns a year in America through that arrangement.\nBut in 2014, the U.S. Treasury imposed economic sanctions on Kalashnikov Concern and other Russian arms makers to punish Putin for supporting separatists in the Ukraine. RWC Group has said that since then, it has cut all ties to Russia and Kalashnikov Concern and is fully complying with the U.S. sanctions.\nTax-Break ApplicationBloomberg Businessweek reported this month that there\u2019s evidence that some ties persisted after sanctions were imposed. In an April 2015 application for $162,000 in tax incentives -- the subject of this week\u2019s federal subpoena -- Kalashnikov USA said it planned to assemble guns at its Pompano Beach plant from parts imported from Russia. (The tax breaks were approved in October 2015, but RWC never received them because it didn\u2019t deliver on commitments to create dozens of high-paying jobs.)\nIn addition, in December 2016, RWC Group said in court filings that it still had a license to make and sell Kalashnikov guns.\nThe sanctions ban any U.S. person or company from doing business with Kalashnikov Concern, so any ties between the Florida factory and the Russian arms maker could raise red flags with the U.S. Treasury, said Daniel Fried, a former U.S. Department of State diplomat who crafted Russia sanctions during the Obama administration.\n\n        \n        Executives for Kalashnikov USA have said generally in interviews and statements that their company isn\u2019t violating sanctions because it makes guns of its own design and doesn\u2019t source any parts from Russia.\n\u2018Museum\u2019 FactoryKalashnikov Concern sits at the crossroads of business and power in Russia. Putin once likened Kalashnikov\u2019s factory there to a \u201cmuseum of modern art.\u201d Last year, he presided over the unveiling of a 16-foot statute of the AK-47\u2019s late inventor, Mikhail Kalashnikov, near the Kremlin.\nKalashnikov Concern CEO Alexey Krivoruchko has the confidence of some of Putin\u2019s closest allies -- so much so that he has been allowed to buy 75 percent of the company from the Russian government since 2014. Krivoruchko has spent his career managing companies under Sergey Chemezov, a powerful Putin appointee who runs Rostec State Corp., a state conglomerate. Chemezov was personally targeted by same the U.S. sanctions that named Kalashnikov Concern.\n\"Krivoruchko is close to Chemezov, who right now is probably the most influential person next to president Putin,\" said Evgeny Minchenko, a Moscow political consultant who advises the Kremlin. \"Chemezov and Putin know each other since they both worked in Germany in the 1980s.\"\nKrivoruchko, who wasn\u2019t been personally sanctioned by the U.S., didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nInterlocking CompaniesKalashnikov Concern, the Russian company, has said that neither it nor its managers or shareholders, have any business relationship with Kalashnikov USA. But a closer look shows how interlocking companies, some of them set up since sanctions began, connect Kalashnikov USA executives to Krivoruchko.\nFor example, Michael Tiraturian is listed as senior vice president of Kalashnikov USA and as manager of its parent, RWC Group. He\u2019s a longtime business associate and friend of Krivoruchko. Tiraturian also is a manager of Florida companies that Krivoruchko created and used to buy a $2.4 million condo, a yacht and luxury cars in Miami over the last seven years.\nTiraturian also is listed as the manager of another Florida company, Solomon Asset Management LLC, which owns 65 percent of RWC Group, documents filed with the state of Florida show.\nTiraturian didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. In an interview earlier this month, Tiraturian said he\u2019s friends with Krivoruchko but denied any current business relationship.\nSince sanctions were put in place, in 2014, the two men don\u2019t even discuss business or Kalashnikov, Tiraturian said. Kalashnikov USA has spent years restructuring the company to comply with sanctions, severing all ties to Russia, he said. \u201cWe were very, very, very careful about what we do,\u201d said Tiraturian, who recently changed his name from Tiraturyan in corporate records. \u201cEverything we are doing is by the book, and clearly we are not doing anything wrong.\u201d\n\u2014 With assistance by Ilya Arkhipov", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jennifer Epstein", "body": "President Donald Trump directed the Justice Department to write regulations banning the use of accessories known as \u201cbump stocks\u201d that allow semiautomatic rifles to be fired more rapidly, and his press secretary declined to rule out supporting restrictions on the purchase of AR-15-style rifles like the one used in a Florida school shooting last week.\n\u201cI signed a memorandum directing the attorney general to propose regulations to ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns,\u201d Trump said on Tuesday at the White House. \u201cI expect that these critical regulations will be finalized, Jeff, very soon,\u201d he added, speaking to Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\nHe added that the government should focus on \u201cevidence-based solutions\u201d to gun violence.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        Asked if Trump would support renewing a federal assault weapons ban that expired more than a decade ago, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said at a briefing that \u201cwe haven\u2019t closed the door on any front.\u201d She also said it \u201chasn\u2019t yet been determined\u201d whether there should be a federal age limit for purchasing semiautomatic rifles like the one the Florida shooter bought as a teenager.\n\u201cBackground checks are something that the president is supportive of making more efficient and looking at better ways to improve that process,\u201d Sanders said.\nHer briefing was the White House\u2019s first since the attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which killed 17 people and reignited calls for stricter gun controls.

The Gates guilty plea prompted Manafort to say he hoped his longtime associate \u201cwould have had the strength to continue the battle to prove our innocence.\u201d\nNew AllyGates worked with Manafort for a decade in Ukraine, serving as a loyal wingman. In his guilty plea, Gates admitted that he helped Manafort set up dozens of undisclosed offshore bank accounts, hide their work as unregistered agents for Ukraine and launder millions of dollars into the U.S. Manafort convinced Gates to help him create false documents for banks, urged his son-in-law to lie to a bank appraiser and misled lenders about the use of loans, prosecutors charged.\nOne reason for Manafort\u2019s depleting cash flow was that the bulk of the work he did with Gates in Ukraine began to dry up when Yanukovych fled to Moscow after widespread popular protest in 2014.\nManafort returned to Ukraine just months after Yanukovych was toppled and Russia annexed Crimea, advising the former president\u2019s Party of Regions to rebrand itself as a catch-all party -- the Opposition Bloc -- that could be the voice of Russians in the east.\n\n        \n        Manafort was paid roughly $1 million for his work on the October 2014 parliamentary election, Nestor Shufrych, one of the Opposition Bloc\u2019s leaders told Bloomberg in April.\nManafort\u2019s last consulting assignment in Ukraine ended less than six months before he started working for the Trump campaign: He spent at least a month in Ukraine advising the Opposition Bloc ahead of local elections in October 2015, said the person familiar with the situation, adding that Manafort received payment for only part of that work.\nIn a 2016 bank loan application, Gates submitted a \"fake invoice\" on Manafort\u2019s behalf\u00a0to support a mortgage on his home in Bridgehampton, New York, according to the indictment. The falsified document said Manafort was owed $2.4 million for a \"consultancy agreement pertaining to parliamentary elections.\" The bank requested more information but later turned down the loan application, prosecutors said.\nUnpaid BillsManafort was still chasing unpaid bills from his Ukrainian work while he was chairman of Trump\u2019s campaign.\nIn July, with Trump closing in on the Republican Party\u2019s nomination, Manafort made a previously reported effort to patch his soured relationship with Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum magnate who is close to President Vladimir Putin.\u00a0\nManafort once did consulting work for Deripaska\u2019s businesses. The men had a falling out over $18.9 million that Deripaska invested with Manafort in a Ukrainian cable television venture in 2007. The venture failed, leading to litigation, including a lawsuit that Deripaska filed in January claiming Manafort and Gates defrauded him.\nIn an email to an intermediary, Manafort offered to give private briefings about the campaign to Deripaska.\u00a0\u201cI assume you have shown our friends my media coverage, right?\" Manafort wrote, according to an email obtained by the Atlantic. \u201cHow do we use to get whole?\"\nManafort wanted to meet in hopes of resolving the dispute over Deripaska\u2019s investment, according to two people familiar with the offer. The meeting never took place, they said.\nA spokeswoman for Deripaska has said he had \u201cno communications, meetings, briefings or other interactions with Mr. Manafort during, after, or in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.\u201d\nLarger Payoff?There are many explanations for why Manafort may have taken a job without pay, including a desire to gain a victory on a national stage to help reboot his consulting work. The indictment doesn\u2019t discuss any interactions with Russians or payoffs.\u00a0\n\u201cIf I were investigating the case, I would want to know whether or not he\u2019s expecting to get some kind of larger payoff from his Russian benefactors,\u201d said Zeidenberg, the former prosecutor.\nStarting around the time Manafort emailed the intermediary about the Deripaska meeting, he also got the first of two loans totaling $16 million, secured by his homes in Bridgehampton and Brooklyn, New York, from a bank not identified in the indictment. Descriptions of the loans match those extended by the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago. The bank is headed by Stephen Calk, who was part of Trump\u2019s economic advisory council during the campaign. Calk and the bank have declined to comment on client financial matters.\nIn all, Manafort defrauded banks of $20 million between 2015 and January 2017, the U.S. alleges.\nWhile Gates and other cooperators could lead Mueller into fresh avenues in its Russia inquiry, they may also help prosecutors flesh out their indelible portrait of Manafort\u2019s financial state. Former prosecutors say that Mueller\u2019s team already has the arc of its narrative, should the case go to trial.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a financial fraud case that sounds more desperate,\u201d said attorney\u00a0Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor. \u201cI\u2019m very confident that prosecutors will say in their opening statement this is a story about a man who was desperate to get this money to live the lifestyle he had and to get the money he had overseas.\u201d\n\u2014 With assistance by Daryna Krasnolutska", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Justin Sink", "body": "President Donald Trump defended his congratulatory call to Vladimir Putin on the Russian leader\u2019s re-election against criticism from some lawmakers that the election wasn\u2019t fair.\n\u201cThey are wrong!\u201d Trump said in a series of tweets Wednesday. \u201cGetting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing,\u201d he continued, \u201cThey can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming Arms Race.\u201d\n\n        \n            \n                I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also).

But the gains they expect to make in governor's races may be more important to the party\u2019s long-term future.\nOf 36 gubernatorial seats up for grabs this year, 26 are held by Republicans. The Democrats' top targets are Ohio, Florida and Michigan, where they have been out of power for years. If they succeed, the party stands to gain strength on three critically important fronts:\nPolicy issues ranging from Medicaid expansion to environmental protection and gay rights.Congressional and state legislative redistricting after the 2020 census.National candidate development: Two of the past three Democratic presidents were governors, but the ranks have been thin recently.\"The governor's races this year are even more important than Congress,\" says Terry McAuliffe, who just stepped down as Virginia governor and is a former party chairman.

The result: a policy and political counterweight to a Democratic White House.\n\n        \n        The fruits of state battles are already becoming clear. The GOP\u2019s gerrymandering in Pennsylvania in 2011 was overturned this year, thanks in part to help of a Democratic governor who took \u00a0office in 2015. The result? Three to five House seats this fall, Democrats say.\nBut they still are suffering from partisan lines in Ohio, Michigan and Florida. All three are purple; only a third of their combined 57 members of the House are Democrats.\nIn recent months, in part reflecting a national tide, Democrats have become more optimistic about contests in Ohio and Michigan.\nRichard Cordray, who clashed with Trump as the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is the party's preferred candidate in Ohio. He should be a strong general election candidate if he avoids getting beat up in the primary by left wing provocateur Dennis Kucinich, the former congressman. That probably would set up a rematch with Attorney General Mike DeWine, who narrowly won in 2010, in a climate friendlier to Republicans.\nIn Michigan, the political and labor union establishment has gotten behind Gretchen Whitmer, a former state legislative leader, one of many women this year riding the energy of the MeToo movement.

After this week's primary, Democrats expect to flip Illinois.\nGovernors aren't as directly affected by the Trump factor as are members of Congress, but the gathering blue wave represents a major force nevertheless. Two Republican governors in Democratic states, Charlie Baker in Massachusetts and Larry Hogan in Maryland, having distanced themselves from Trump are in good shape.\nBoth sides are looking for a surprise.

Now, as Special Counsel Robert Mueller bears down on Trump, Flynn is a key cooperating witness.\nA three-month Bloomberg investigation has found that Flynn, who was fired for having lied to the FBI and the vice president about his contacts with Russians, had a slew of other problematic entanglements. Previously unreported documents, including Pentagon contracts, emails and internal company papers, point to overlapping business conflicts around the world.\u00a0\nSelf-dealing is, in some ways, at the core of the Mueller inquiry, which is looking at money laundering, contact with foreign (especially Russian) officials and a blending of personal profit with public policy. During the campaign, the transition and his few weeks as national security adviser, Flynn was in Trump\u2019s inner circle. While it remains unclear what he\u2019s providing Mueller, his history of mingling business with government could point investigators to look for similar overlaps among other Trump insiders.\n\n        \n    \n\n    \u201cThese conflicts of interest and hidden deals are highly relevant to what was going on with the Russians,\u201d said Nick Akerman, a former Watergate prosecutor, noting that Flynn was in close touch with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak while also being close to Trump. \u201cHis hidden business entanglements\u00a0and his back channel communications with foreign governments raise a lot of possibilities.\u201d\nFlynn\u2019s troubles trace back to a previously unreported million-dollar contract for computer chips forged with a friend, Bijan Kian, a suave, Iranian-born businessman. A former governor at the Export-Import Bank, Kian was chairman of a Persian cultural nonprofit group, the Nowruz Commission, that gave him entree into high Washington circles. He built a relationship with former CIA Director James Woolsey and, in 2013, used it to get Flynn, then the Pentagon\u2019s top intelligence officer, to support his computer chip company\u2019s bid for a contract.\nThe next year, when Flynn was forced out by the Obama administration, his friendship with Kian blossomed into a business partnership. Kian brought him into the chip company, GreenZone Systems Inc., as a board member. According to Flynn\u2019s financial disclosure, GreenZone and its parent company paid him more than $150,000 in cash, plus an undisclosed amount of stock in 2015.\nKian also helped fund and found Flynn Intelligence Group, the ex-general\u2019s consulting firm, and served as a senior partner. While it\u2019s been known that Flynn was advocating in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Israel in 2015 for a consortium seeking to build several dozen nuclear power reactors, it\u2019s not been reported that he and Kian were also trying to sell GreenZone\u2019s secure chips as part of the deal. Flynn lied about the trip in his federal disclosures.\nKian also brought Flynn Intel its most problematic deal: a previously reported $530,000 contract with Dutch company Inovo BV, ostensibly to improve the business climate in Turkey. Flynn later admitted that the contract primarily benefited Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and that his firm had been paid to lobby U.S. officials to extradite an Erdogan enemy living in Pennsylvania.\nWhen he pleaded guilty in December, Flynn acknowledged that he had lied about the extent of his work for the Turkish government, though he was charged only with making false statements to federal agents about his contacts with Russia\u2019s ambassador.\nNeither Kian nor Flynn agreed to be interviewed for this story and their lawyers declined to comment. Kian has never spoken publicly about his business dealings with Flynn.\nNational Security Agency\u00a0Director Mike Rogers (left), Bijan Kian\u00a0(center) and Michael Flynn at a Nowruz Commission gala in 2014.\u00a0\nSource: Facebook\nAfter Trump\u2019s election victory, Flynn and Kian, both of whom served on the transition team\u2019s intelligence committee, worked on highly sensitive matters without disclosing that they had been paid to represent Turkey\u2019s government. Flynn also stopped a U.S. military plan to attack Islamic State in an offensive that would have armed the Kurds, Erdogan\u2019s avowed enemy, according to a Flynn confidant who said the decision was aimed at assessing previous policy.\nOnce Trump was sworn in, Flynn used his position as national security adviser to promote the Middle East nuclear deal that he and Kian had also pursued as a business opportunity for GreenZone. Documents released by a congressional oversight committee, citing the Wall Street Journal, show that Flynn, without disclosing his investment, ordered his staff to prepare a briefing memo urging the president to approve the plan.\nFlynn first met Kian in 2008, according to a disclosure Kian filed. There are photos of them socializing at the Nowruz Commission in 2011, and, by 2013, when Flynn was running the Defense Intelligence Agency, Kian came calling to pitch his computer chip.\nKian had tried for years to sell his chip to the government. White House logs show he was a frequent visitor, pushing the chip there in a 2012 meeting, according to a participant. The following February, Kian\u2019s fortunes changed when he got former CIA director Woolsey, a GreenZone board member, to help him land a meeting with Flynn. Flynn greeted the men at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, a military\u00a0base in Washington, and walked them to his office, a GreenZone colleague recalled. Woolsey declined to comment for this article.\nA slide from the presentation used to sell GreenZone Systems computer chips.\nKian spent nearly two hours extolling the benefits of his microchip that, once plugged into a smartphone, can mask the user\u2019s identity.\nFlynn was impressed. In a move that hasn\u2019t been reported before, he assigned the DIA\u2019s chief scientist to help the chip maker pass military certification standards, according to people Kian briefed on the meeting.\n\u201cIt was fantastic,\u201d Kian told a colleague after that first meeting. \u201cWe got everything we wanted.\u201d\u00a0The colleague, who was involved in GreenZone\u2019s promotional efforts, spoke on condition of anonymity.\nBy May, according to a previously unreported email Kian\u2019s associate sent to GreenZone executives, the company was \u201cway ahead\u201d of competitors in its quest for a contract with the DIA, which was considering buying 250 units that included the chips.\n\n        \n    \n\n    GreenZone\u2019s bid was still pending in August 2014, when\u00a0Flynn left the military. In November, Flynn joined GreenZone\u2019s board. The following year,\u00a0GreenZone was awarded a $1.1 million contract from the Pentagon\u2019s Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office, which works with, but doesn\u2019t report to, the DIA.\nIn the view of many ethicists, Flynn\u2019s actions challenged the spirit of Defense Department ethics guidelines but didn\u2019t violate their letter. The rules forbid former employees from accepting a job or compensation from a company within a year of helping it obtain a government contract worth at least $10 million. GreenZone\u2019s contract fell far below that threshold.\n\u201cThat\u2019s almost the classic revolving door problem in Washington,\u201d said Larry Noble, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan group that advocates adherence to campaign finance laws. \u201cWhen you move right to a company that you helped when you were in government, it raises the appearance of something untoward going on, even if there was none.\u201d\n\u201cThis new information indicates that General Flynn\u2019s use of public positions for profit was far more wide-ranging than previously known.\u201d\nKian also worked with Flynn Intel to drum up business around the globe. In October 2015, the two men traveled to Saudi Arabia, where they urged a utility company to hire GreenZone to design and install security systems around nuclear power plants the Saudis were said to be planning, according to company documents obtained by Bloomberg.\nWhen asked about that trip by Congress last June, Flynn said he had traveled with a friend to speak at a conference. He declined to name the friend, the speakers\u00a0bureau that represents Flynn has no record of a conference\u00a0and the hotel he told Congress he stayed at doesn\u2019t exist. Representative\u00a0Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House oversight committee, told Bloomberg that Flynn misled the FBI about the trip and gave false information about it on his security clearance form, both crimes.\n\u201cThis new information indicates that General Flynn\u2019s use of public positions for profit was far more wide-ranging than previously known,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cWe have been raising red flags and requesting documents about these issues for the past year, but the White House continues to stonewall us, and Republicans in Congress continue to wall off the White House from serious oversight.\u201d\nA year after the Saudi trip, in September 2016\u2014the height of the presidential campaign\u2014Kian\u00a0met with half a dozen staffers from the House Homeland Security Committee to promote GreenZone\u2019s secure communications products, saying their end-to-end encryption could protect communications by special forces in the battlefield. At the end of the meeting, Kian suggested a follow-up meeting for a live demonstration.\nAt that gathering, several weeks later at Flynn Intel\u2019s offices in Alexandria, Virginia, Kian was accompanied by Justin Freeh, a GreenZone board member and son of former FBI Director Louis Freeh. After 20 minutes of demonstrating the technology, Kian abruptly ushered in another group with an entirely separate and unexpected agenda. They talked about Fethullah Gulen, the Turkish cleric living legally in Pennsylvania and accused by Turkish President Erdogan of leading a coup attempt. The presenters called Gulen a terrorist and urged hearings about the danger he posed in hopes of getting him extradited. Kian was told the committee couldn\u2019t help.\u00a0Freeh didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nThat same month, Flynn and Kian met with Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican congressman from California who is supportive of Russia, to discuss the construction of up to 40 nuclear power plants across the Mideast in cooperation with Russia, a plan promoted by a consortium that included\u00a0former U.S. military men hoping to work with Flynn and GreenZone. Mueller\u2019s office has inquired about that meeting, according to lawyers involved in the case.\nFlynn arrives at the U.S. Courthouse in Washington on Dec. 1, 2017.\nPhotographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg\nThe previous month, when Flynn began receiving classified security briefings as part of the campaign staff, Kian brought in the $530,000 Turkish contract.\nWoolsey told the Wall Street Journal last year that Flynn and several Turkish government officials met in New York to discuss abducting Gulen and flying him to Turkey. Woolsey reported the plan to a friend who worked for Vice President Joe Biden, saying he considered it illegal, according to a former Biden aide.\nFlynn\u2019s lawyer, Robert Kelner, issued a statement last year denying that Flynn had ever considered detaining Gulen. An Inovo spokeswoman also said there wasn\u2019t any such plan.\nKian also played a crucial role, according to several people involved, in the preparation of an anti-Gulen op-ed article by Flynn that was published the day\u00a0Trump won the election and that has become a frequently cited part of the Turkish government\u2019s campaign against the cleric.\nIn his guilty plea in federal court, Flynn acknowledged lying to FBI agents when he denied that Turkish government officials had played a role in the article.\nFlynn helped Kian land a spot on the transition, where he prepared incoming CIA nominee Mike Pompeo for his confirmation hearing and pushed a number of policy proposals, including fighting a potential threat from electromagnetic pulses, or EMPs. Pompeo has recently been named secretary of state.\nAnother controversial and previously unreported proposal Flynn and Kian promoted was to hire private security contractors to collect information around the globe, then sidestep the CIA and provide the intelligence directly to the national security adviser, according to people who worked with them on the transition.\u00a0Flynn couldn\u2019t hold his administration job long enough to shepherd those plans into action.\nNine days after the inauguration, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates warned the administration that Flynn was susceptible to blackmail because he had lied to officials about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. Flynn resigned after 24 days. He\u2019s no longer on the GreenZone board.\nKian\u2019s standing in official Washington has evaporated. According to associates, he has been spending long stretches of time in California. GreenZone was sold. And the Nowruz Commission has canceled its gala for 2018.\n\u2014With assistance from\u00a0Andrew Martin\u00a0and\u00a0Peter Robison.", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Toluse Olorunnipa", "body": "President Donald Trump\u2019s direct assault on Robert Mueller over the weekend renewed fears he\u2019s preparing to fire the special counsel as Republicans mostly remained silent on the threat.\nJust a few Republicans strongly warned Trump against firing Mueller -- Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said it could lead to the end of Trump\u2019s presidency.

The strongest Republican response to the attacks on the Mueller probe from Trump and his lawyer came from Graham, who repeated in a CNN interview his warning from last year that firing Mueller would be \u201cthe beginning of the end of his presidency.\u201d\nRyan\u2019s Standing PositionFew Republicans joined in.\nMost ducked the issue while at home over the weekend, though House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s spokeswoman, Ashlee Strong, reaffirmed his standing position that the probe should continue.\n\u201cAs the speaker has always said, Mr. Mueller and his team should be able to do their jobs,\u2019\u2019 she said Sunday in a statement.\nAiling GOP Senator John McCain defended Mueller on Twitter, praising his \u201chonesty and integrity\u201d and saying it\u2019s \u201ccritical\u201d the investigation continue \u201cunimpeded.\u201d\nOther Republicans appearing on Sunday talk shows also warned against firing Mueller, but, like Ryan, without saying what they\u2019d do if Trump acts.\nRepresentative Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight Committee and a member of the Intelligence Committee, dinged Dowd, the president\u2019s lawyer, for calling for the investigation to be shut down.\n\u201cIf you have an innocent client, Mr. Dowd, act like it,\u201d he said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\nBut asked what the House of Representatives, which has the power to bring articles of impeachment, would do if Trump fired Mueller, Gowdy said \u201cI\u2019m not sure the House can do a lot.\u201d\nLegislation StalledSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell didn\u2019t comment. The Kentucky Republican said in January he saw no need to act to protect Mueller because he knew of no official effort to undermine the probe. Without McConnell\u2019s backing, bipartisan legislation designed to protect Mueller from dismissal has far stalled so far in the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nDemocrats sounded the alarm and implored Republican colleagues to speak out.\n\u201cEvery member of Congress, Republican and Democrat needs to step up in defense of the Special Counsel. Now,\u201d tweeted Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.\n\u201cOur GOP colleagues, particularly the leadership, have an obligation to our country to stand up and make it clear that firing Mueller is a red line for our democracy that cannot be crossed,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.\nFiring Mueller would be a messy process in any case because Trump can\u2019t remove him directly. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller, has overseen the probe since Attorney General Sessions recused himself. If Trump ordered Rosenstein to fire Mueller and he refused, Trump could fire Rosenstein. That would put Solicitor General Noel Francisco in line to oversee the investigation -- and decide on Mueller\u2019s fate.\nThe probe appears to be focusing more directly on Trump himself.\nMueller recently gave Trump a list of avenues for questioning ahead of a possible interview with investigators, the New York Times reported.

The tax inquiry appears unrelated to other investigations that have since burst into public view. It began before Special Counsel Robert Mueller was appointed in May to investigate Russian election meddling. In a separate action around that time, U.S. prosecutors in Brooklyn sought information from Kushner Cos. about its use of a foreign visa program.\n        \n        \n        \n        In the tax investigation, it\u2019s unclear whether authorities are looking at\u00a0Kushner business associates or the company itself.A lawyer representing the company, Charles J. Harder, said in a written statement: \u201cKushner Cos. is not under investigation for any tax issues. It has had no contact with anyone at the IRS or Justice Department Tax Division. It has received no subpoenas or audit requests about its taxes. It is not in tax court on any audits. If there is an investigation about others\u2019 taxes, it has nothing to do with Kushner Cos. or its businesses.\u201dSpokesmen for the Justice Department and the IRS declined to comment.Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, stepped down from the family business when he joined the administration a year ago and divested some assets by transferring them to relatives.Other InquiriesThe Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. prosecutors in Brooklyn issued subpoenas to Kushner Cos. last May, seeking details on its use of the EB-5 program for foreign investors, according to two people, who asked not to be named because the requests weren\u2019t public.\u00a0\n        \n        The EB-5 program offers foreigners green cards and permanent residence in exchange for investing $500,000 in certain U.S. businesses that create at least 10 jobs per investor. Kushner Cos. used the program to build a Trump-branded apartment building in Jersey City and sought to draw on it for another project there.The Brooklyn prosecutors have\u00a0also requested documents from Deutsche Bank AG related to a retail property that the Kushners bought in 2015 for $296 million. Within a year, that property, formerly the New York Times headquarters, was appraised at $445 million, and the Kushners took out $370 million in loans, including $285 million from Deutsche Bank. The bank sold most of the debt to Wall Street investors. The focus of that inquiry isn\u2019t clear.Kushner Cos. has said it\u2019s cooperating with inquiries.Special CounselWhile the U.S. special counsel works in secret and has a broad mandate, he hasn\u2019t brought any tax charges. As part of his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, Mueller has charged four Trump associates,\u00a0including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.Manafort is accused of money laundering and hiding his political consulting work for Ukrainian political leaders. The indictment also alleges that he didn\u2019t report income on his tax returns, but it doesn\u2019t charge him with evasion or filing false returns. He denies wrongdoing.Kushner Cos. was embroiled in a criminal tax case more than a decade ago. Jared Kushner\u2019s father, Charles, pleaded guilty in 2004 to lying about political donations, cheating on his taxes and witness intimidation after arranging a videotape of a brother-in-law having sex with a prostitute.Four years later, another top company executive was convicted of conspiracy and aiding the filing of false partnership tax returns. Prosecutors accused him of creating false returns by illegally claiming $6 million in deductions for charitable and political contributions, capital expenditures and gift and entertainment expenses. In all, seven people were convicted of tax charges in the scheme.

The arrest was one of hundreds in a flurry of raids this week across the state as part of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on undocumented immigrants.\nThe conflict peaked politically this week after Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf warned residents on Saturday of an imminent sting, giving those without papers time to evade the sweeps. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it had arrested 232 individuals over a four-day operation through Wednesday who were in violation of federal immigration laws, of which 115 had prior felony convictions.\n\u2018Gang Lookout\u2019\n        \n        Thomas Homan, the agency\u2019s acting director, estimated earlier this week that more than 800 \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d remained at large in the Bay Area and blamed the mayor in part for some of those misses, likening her warnings to \u201ca gang lookout yelling \u2018police.\u201d\u2019\u00a0The enforcement action is a direct response to California\u2019s sanctuary policies, in which local agencies don\u2019t cooperate with immigration enforcement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that a mayor would circumvent federal authorities and certainly put them in danger by making a move such as that,\u201d White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters in a briefing Thursday.\nSchaaf blasted the agency and Trump administration\u2019s immigration policy as racist.\nBoth Trump\u2019s opponents and some Trump supporters in California can agree on one thing: raids are bad for business. Reports of sweeps and high-profile detentions are terrifying the state\u2019s undocumented population -- estimated at 2.6 million in 2015 -- who are scared to leave their homes.\nOngoing ShortageTheir absence threatens segments of the largest state economy, including retailers, restaurants and the Central Valley\u2019s $47 billion agricultural industry, which provides more than half of the fruits, nuts and vegetables in the country. That broad, 450-mile swath of California yields an eighth of the country\u2019s agricultural output.\n\n        \n        The farm industry is already struggling to find workers like Maria\u2019s husband. More than 55 percent of 762 farmers and ranchers surveyed in a California Farm Bureau Federation report from October 2017 said half of their land continues to go unattended because of an ongoing labor shortage directly related to U.S. immigration policy.\nOf the state\u2019s more than 2 million farm laborers, 1.5 million are undocumented, according to Tom Nassif, President of the Western Growers Association, a 92-year-old industry group representing farmers in California, Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico. Although Nassif and the association have supported Trump since the early days of his campaign, he says the raids and decades-old immigration policy for farm workers are harming the industry and state economy.\nWorkforce Protections\u201cWe know that a majority of our workers have presented false documents in order to gain employment, so (the raids) are always a concern to us, especially at a time when we have significant labor shortages and no hope that the federal government is going to pass legislation which allows us to have a legal workforce,\u201d Nassif said. \u201cWe\u2019re not so much married to a particular proposal. We just have to have protections for our existing workforce.\u201d\nJames Schwab, a spokesman for ICE, declined to comment on Nassif\u2019s assertions.\nMaria declined to share her full name or her husband\u2019s for this story, citing concerns ICE agents will find her and send her to the same jail in Bakersfield where her husband is waiting to be deported to Mexico. Maria has three school-aged children, a four-year-old with cerebral palsy and an infant.\n\u201cI tell my kids that their father was taken away because he\u2019s Mexican and President Trump doesn\u2019t want us here,\u201d said Maria, whose family is now living without a father, income or savings while she searches for an attorney to take her husband\u2019s case for free.\nSeasonal VisasCongress is currently mulling a proposal to amend its seasonal workers\u2019 visa program by capping the number it issues every year at 410,000. The legislation would attempt to force all undocumented workers to return to their native countries and apply for visas. Only a fraction of those who apply would be allowed to return.\nIn effect, that would would be a prohibition on undocumented labor that would paralyze California\u2019s agriculture industry, said Nassif, which is already losing acres of labor-intensive crops, including cherries, apples, peppers and berries to farms in Mexico, South and Central America and East Asia. After setting records for revenue every year in the six years to 2015, receipts fell 13 percent to $47 billion in 2016 because of \u201cthe ongoing drought and shifting market conditions,\u201d according to Karen Ross, Secretary of California\u2019s Department of Food and Agriculture.\nThe most significant \u201cmarket condition\u201d is the labor shortage,\u00a0said Arturo Rodriguez, president of the United Farm Workers of America union, a problem that will get worse as long as Trump\u2019s ICE continues to target California.\nFor every employee who\u2019s detained -- from a farm, restaurant or California meatpacking plant -- dozens of others become fearful of returning to work. Employees across the state are quitting their jobs on the spot when informed that their employers have received federal audit forms requiring them to produce employee work authorization papers. A dozen of the 35 employees at Ruby\u2019s Diner in Commerce, California, east of Los Angeles, quit on Feb. 15 when ICE dropped by the restaurant with the audit form. ICE never returned, as they promised, on Feb. 22.\n\u201cThis is retaliation from an administration hostile to immigrants,\u201d said David Huerta, President of the Service Employees International Union United Service Workers West. \u201cFruit is going to die on the vine this year because of this administration.

In the 1980s, he went broke. In 2008, during the financial crisis, he lost billions of dollars on Citigroup Inc. But nothing compares with the humiliation he sustained over the past few months. Last November, Alwaleed\u2019s uncle, King Salman, and his cousin, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, engineered a government roundup of alleged fraudsters, embezzlers, and money launderers that landed Alwaleed in Riyadh\u2019s now-infamous Ritz-Carlton hotel. He didn\u2019t leave for 83 days.\nI saw Alwaleed in late October, the week before he became a prisoner of the state. We spent an evening at his desert camp chatting about the financial markets and U.S. politics, watching a soccer match on TV, taking a walk through the sands, and eating a late dinner in the cool midnight air. Seven weeks after his release, in mid-March, I returned to the kingdom. Alwaleed had decided to break his silence and grant me an interview on Bloomberg Television.\nWe met informally the day before the interview at his palace in Riyadh. As I waited in the foyer, the prince descended the grand staircase from the second floor. He was dressed casually in a beige thobe, brown wool sports jacket, and sandals, and he struck me as relaxed. Over the next two hours, between sips of Arabic coffee and ginger tea, while his five granddaughters sang and danced to Katy Perry\u2019s Hot n Cold in the palace gym, he recounted his ordeal.\nIn the early hours of Nov. 4, Alwaleed, at his desert camp for the weekend, received a phone call summoning him to the royal court. He left at once, without any inkling he was walking into a trap. Soon government officials were leaking the sensational details of an anticorruption purge, with news reports pinpointing Alwaleed as the most prominent among hundreds of tycoons, government ministers, and other princes who were being detained at the Ritz-Carlton. Shares of his main company, Kingdom Holding Co., plummeted 21 percent in three days.\n\n        \n    \n\n    Alwaleed was quite the prize for a government eager to show its people that no Saudi was exempt from an ongoing crackdown on freeloading and graft: His\u00a0fortune of $17.1 billion places him 65th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. And his international profile\u2014forged through friendships and business partnerships with the likes of Bill Gates and Rupert Murdoch\u2014rivals that of Prince Mohammed. Kingdom Holding\u2019s portfolio includes Four Seasons Hotels  Resorts, Citigroup, Euro Disney, and Twitter. Rotana Group, which he controls separately, is the Arab world\u2019s largest entertainment company.\nThe government offered detainees a stark choice: pay up, sign an admission of guilt, and walk free\u2014or refuse and languish. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the price for Alwaleed\u2019s release was $6 billion. Negotiations were held in secret, and the government never disclosed any charges or produced any evidence. Critics said that due process was being denied and accused Prince Mohammed of conducting an intimidation campaign or simply a shakedown under the guise of fighting corruption.\nRumors of mistreatment and even torture at the Ritz-Carlton began to swirl, finding their way into reports by the Daily Mail Online and regional news media. So when the prince, still at the hotel, surfaced in a smartphone video in late January, after more than 2\u00bd months of confinement, appearing underfed and haggard, the speculation only intensified. He said he was being treated decently. No one believed it. (Others may not have fared as well. More recently the New York Times reported, citing anonymous sources, that some detainees were physically abused and otherwise coerced into confessions, and that one military officer in custody died bearing signs of a brutal beating.)\nSince his release, hours after the video was shot, Alwaleed has regained some weight, and he seems as energetic, intense, and engaged as ever. But in conversation it\u2019s clear he\u2019s struggling mightily with the experience. Even if he\u2019s innocent\u2014and he insists he is\u2014the government lumped him in with a group it cast largely as a bunch of crooks. And to complain about that or otherwise fall out of line is to invite a wrath he\u2019s witnessed all too closely.\nWe recorded the interview on a makeshift set in Alwaleed\u2019s apartment on the 67th floor of Riyadh\u2019s Kingdom Tower. Walking in, I wondered how candid he could be. Would he be forthcoming about life inside the Ritz-Carlton? If he\u2019d been harmed, would he admit it? Had he been forced to accept a devil\u2019s bargain to win his release? Would he be credible? What if the government had threatened him? Would I be able to tell?\nThe following is an excerpted version of our conversation, lightly edited for clarity.\nPrince Alwaleed\u00a0bin Talal in his penthouse office suite in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\nPhotographer: Guy Martin for Bloomberg Businessweek\nStarting with the obvious: WhyAlwaleed\u2019s detention was more mysterious than most. Of all the princes who were brought in, he alone hadn\u2019t served in the Saudi government, where kickbacks are considered common. And unlike other businessmen, he wasn\u2019t a government contractor and so couldn\u2019t have overbilled the state. He made most of his wealth transparently, in real estate and as an investor in public markets.\nErik Schatzker: Why were you arrested in the first place?\nPrince Alwaleed: Well, I would not use the word \u201carrested,\u201d because we were invited to the king\u2019s house and then asked to go to the Ritz-Carlton. So it was done with honor and dignity, and our prestige was maintained. Not only me; everybody else.\nSo the word \u201carrest\u201d is fair to use for those who did commit a crime, admit their guilt?\nExactly. And reached a settlement with the government. But in my case, you know, it\u2019s very much different.\nSo were there never any charges? Were you ever accused of anything?\nThere were no charges. Because I have a fiduciary responsibility to my shareholders in Kingdom Holding, to my friends in Saudi Arabia, and to the world community, because we have international investments all over the place, it\u2019s very important to say that there was zero accusation and zero guilt.\nYou\u2019ve described the whole ordeal as a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding over what?\nWhen I say misunderstanding, it\u2019s because I believe I shouldn\u2019t have been there. Now that I\u2019ve left, I would say that I\u2019ve been vindicated. Yet I have to acknowledge to you, for the first time, that yes, we do have with the government a confirmed understanding, going forward.\nWhat does that mean?\nIt is very confidential. I cannot get into that. But there is a confirmed understanding between the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and me personally.\nDoes that require you to do certain things? \nNot necessarily. I cannot get into that, because it is confidential and secret between me and the government. But rest assured that this does not really handcuff me.\nWhat did the government want from you?\nI will not get into the discussions that took place between me and representatives of the government.\nThey must have wanted something.\nI read what was written, that they wanted a chunk of A or B or C of what I have. This was all rumors.\nAccording to one report, it was $6 billion.\nI read $6 billion, I read more than that and less than that.\nDid it cost you anything to leave? Did you have to pay the government any money, did you have to hand over any land, did you have to surrender any shares?\nWhen I say it\u2019s a confidential and secret agreement, an arrangement based on a confirmed understanding between me and the government of Saudi Arabia, you have to respect that.\nI\u2019m a Saudi citizen. But I\u2019m also a member of the royal family. The king is my uncle. Mohammed bin Salman is my cousin. So my interest is in maintaining the relationship between us and keeping it unscratched.\nYou maintain your innocence. You say you didn\u2019t sign a settlement acknowledging guilt and that you\u2019re different.\nWe signed something, yes, a confirmed understanding. Some others may call it a settlement. I don\u2019t call it a settlement, because settlement to me is an acknowledgment you\u2019ve done something wrong.\nYou realize, of course, how important it is to be candid and honest with me about this, because the circle of knowledge is too wide. If a different story emerges, your credibility will suffer.\nSure.\nSo everything you\u2019ve told me is 100 percent true? \nI have a confirmed understanding with the government, and it\u2019s ongoing. I\u2019ll elaborate on that: It\u2019s an ongoing process with the government.\n\n        \n    \n\n    The matter of Alwaleed\u2019s reputationAlready, Kingdom Holding is talking to lenders about getting as much as $2 billion in debt financing\u2014\u201cfirepower,\u201d the prince says, for his next deal.\nThis whole ordeal has affected your reputation. People will still believe, no matter what you tell me, that because you were in the Ritz-Carlton you must be guilty of something. You must realize that.\nWhen you are detained, for sure some of the business community, some of the banking community will say they have doubts. That\u2019s my job right now, to interact, to meet with all of them individually or jointly and tell my story.\nI understand it\u2019s not going to be easy at all, because some banks and some people in the business community will be doubtful. They\u2019ll say, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d However, I assure them that everything is normal, everything is back to normal, and that we are functioning as we were before.\nIt would surely help if the government said, \u201cAlwaleed did nothing wrong, it was a misunderstanding, he paid nothing to leave, he remains a Saudi citizen in good standing.\u201d That hasn\u2019t happened.\nAll of these points were covered in the confirmed understanding, the agreement between me and the government.\nThe fact that I\u2019m speaking to you right now, and I\u2019m saying everything truthfully and honestly, and the fact the government is not going to say, \u201cAlwaleed is wrong,\u201d is an approval of what I\u2019m saying.\nSo you feel you need to speak out to, what, clear your name, because you\u2019ve been maligned?\nI need to clear my name, No.\u20091, and to clear up a lot of the lies. For example, when they said that I was tortured, I was sent to a prison, you know, during my 83 days in the Ritz-Carlton hotel. All these were lies. I stayed there the whole time. I was never tortured.\nThe games room at\u00a0Alwaleed\u2019s palace in Riyadh.\nPhotographer: Guy Martin for Bloomberg Businessweek\nInside the Ritz-CarltonAcross three months, 381 Saudis were hauled in and locked up at the Ritz-Carlton, which boasts 492 rooms, 52 acres of land, and 62,000 feet of conference space. Many left quickly. Alwaleed\u2019s stay was among the longest. The prince says he was kept in Room 628, a 4,575-square-foot royal suite.\nHow did you spend your time?\nA lot of sports, a lot of walking, a lot of meditation, a lot of watching news, a lot of praying.\nWhat was a typical day like?\nI would go to sleep at 6, 7 o\u2019clock [a.m.] and then wake up around noon. We prayed five times a day.\nYou had access to television, to newspapers?\nI had access to everything, everything.\nSo no one on the outside knew what was happening inside, but those of you on the inside knew everything about what was happening on the outside?\nExactly. That\u2019s why I was able to get information about this so-called torture.\nSo you were not harmed or mistreated in any way?\nNot one iota.\nYou\u2019re certain that nobody else who was at the Ritz-Carlton suffered anything akin to abuse, torture, wasn\u2019t even roughed up?\nMaybe someone tried to run away or do something crazy. Maybe he was put down and controlled. Maybe. But for sure there was nothing you could call systematic torturing.\nWere you allowed to talk to other detainees?\nNo. No two people in the Ritz-Carlton could talk to each other. Even in my case. I did not see anyone. I did not talk to anyone.\nYou were allowed to make some phone calls. To whom and under what conditions?\nI made my calls to my son, to my daughter and my granddaughters. And I talked to the heads of my companies, the CEO of Kingdom Holding, the head of my private office, and the secretary general of my foundation.\nWere those calls being monitored?\nMost likely, yes.\nAlwaleed\u00a0with his family at his Riyadh palace.\nPhotographer: Guy Martin for Bloomberg Businessweek\nDealing with the crown princeFor more than 70 years, the Saudi throne passed from one brother to another, but Salman broke with the past, first giving his son control over several government portfolios, then elevating him last year to crown prince. Prince Mohammed\u2019s plans include Vision 2030, an economic program that may see Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s largest oil company, go public. Movie theaters, banned since the early 1980s, are back, and in parts of Riyadh women walk without an abaya covering their heads. Starting in June, they\u2019ll be permitted to drive for the first time since 1990.\nWhat was it like being held captive by your own cousin?\nIt was not easy, I have to confess. It\u2019s not easy to be held against your will. But when I left, I had a very strange feeling. I gathered all the senior officers in my companies and all my close confidants and I told them, \u201cI swear to you I have complete serenity, complete comfort, and no grudge and no bad feelings at all.\u201d\nAnd sure enough, within 24 hours we were back in communication with the king\u2019s office, with the crown prince and his people. That\u2019s a very strange situation. But it\u2019s a fact.\nThat\u2019s because you simply had to move forward?\nNo. I\u2019m a nationalist. I\u2019m patriotic. I believe in my country. So I\u2019m not going to have this, this irritation that happened to me create a vendetta and turn me against my uncle, my cousin, my nation, and my people.\nHow would you describe your relationship with Prince Mohammed?\nIt\u2019s stronger. That\u2019s shocking to many people, even to my people.\nYou\u2019ve forgiven him?\nI\u2019ve forgotten and forgiven the whole process completely. It\u2019s behind me.\nHow often are you and he in contact?\nBarely three days go by without me texting or calling or talking to him.\nYou and he talk almost every three days?\nWe text a lot, but we talk less frequently. Barely a week goes without us communicating.\nPrince Mohammed has a grand plan for the transformation of the Saudi economy and Saudi society. Do you remain supportive?\nYes. His vision took a lot of my ideas, but he multiplied them. I had the sovereign wealth fund idea, I talked about Aramco going public. Women\u2019s rights, women competing in society, women driving, all of these things I called for.\nHe\u2019s establishing a new era in Saudi Arabia. Any person who does not support what Mohammed bin Salman is doing right now, I say, is a traitor.\n\n        \n    \n\n    Navigating the new Saudi ArabiaThe crown prince has also become the biggest Saudi investor, plowing tens of billions of state dollars into Uber Technologies Inc. and funds run by Blackstone Group and SoftBank\u00a0Group.\nDoes the government want you building and maintaining relationships with heads of state and CEOs of multinational companies?\nWhen I left, there were zero conditions on me, which means life as usual. I\u2019ve been in touch with many heads of states, in Europe and the Middle East. Everything\u2019s normal.\nCan you travel?\nSure I can.\nDo you know whether the government is monitoring your whereabouts?\nI\u2019m not worried about that.\nAnd your bank accounts?\nEverything\u2019s back to normal.\nYou\u2019re looking for foreign investments and so is the Public Investment Fund, Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund.\u00a0 Doesn\u2019t that put you in competition?\nActually, we\u2019re in touch with the government to be involved in many projects. They\u2019re going to have a big project in the Red Sea with Maldives-type resorts. Four Seasons was invited to be there. We\u2019ve also been invited to be part of another project in Riyadh, where there\u2019s going to be a huge entertainment center. You know, Disney-type.\nWe\u2019re in hotels, we\u2019re in media and in entertainment, so we\u2019re invited. So no, no competition, we complement each other.\nWhat about co-investment? Will the PIF invest together with Kingdom Holding, or perhaps Rotana, or Prince Alwaleed personally?\nYes, this will happen. We\u2019re in discussions right now with the PIF on certain projects.\nDomestic projects or international ventures?\nDomestically, to begin with.\nThe crown prince is touring the West. He\u2019s meeting President Trump at the White House, and he\u2019s trying to attract capital to Saudi Arabia. Given your experience at the Ritz-Carlton, how good can you feel about presenting a common front with the government, the very same government that put you in the hotel?\nI\u2019m supportive of Saudi Arabia, supportive of my government, supportive of King Salman and Prince Mohammed bin Salman all the way. Before, during, and after detention.\nPeople will find that hard to understand.\nThey don\u2019t understand that you\u2019re talking to a person who is a member of the royal family. We\u2019re all one party here. One party. The ruling family of Saudi Arabia.\nI understand it sounds weird to people. They\u2019ll say, \u201cYou\u2019ve been detained by the king and by the crown prince and you\u2019re still supporting them?\u201d You bet.\nYou have to wonder how comfortable CEOs will be investing in Saudi Arabia after seeing the Ritz-Carlton method of dealing with disputes.\nThey have to decide that. But I can speak on my own behalf, and I can tell you it\u2019s business as usual: We\u2019re going to invest in Saudi Arabia.", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jennifer Jacobs", "body": "President Donald Trump made a snap decision to oust H.R. McMaster as national security adviser, moving as the administration weighs tough actions against Russia and acting far sooner than many White House aides expected.\nMcMaster\u2019s departure had been the subject of intense speculation in recent days, yet most administration officials thought it wouldn\u2019t come for weeks. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said just a week ago that the two men had a great working relationship.\nBut Trump changed all that on Thursday evening, abruptly replacing McMaster with John Bolton, a former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and proponent of the 2003 Iraq War best known for his hawkish views.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        The move was announced by Trump on Twitter so quickly on Thursday afternoon that many of the president\u2019s top aides didn\u2019t know it was coming.\nEven by the standards of Trump, it was a turbulent day that left staff frustrated and demoralized. Earlier, the president rattled markets by imposing tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese imports, saw one of his top lawyers in the Russia probe quit in frustration and watched Congress struggle to try to avoid a government shutdown.\nThe ride isn\u2019t over: Sunday brings a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with porn actress Stormy Daniels, who is expected to say she slept with Trump just months after his wife Melania gave birth to their son in 2006.\nNorth KoreaThe McMaster move also means Trump is heading into talks with North Korea with a new national security team, having also just sacked his top diplomat, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Trump\u2019s tariffs meanwhile risk alienating one of the most important countries to the success of those talks, China -- which retaliated early Friday with $3 billion in levies on imports from the U.S.\nMcMaster\u2019s exit also comes as Trump faces tough decisions on whether to punish Russia for the attempted assassination of a former spy in the U.K. His security advisers discussed on Wednesday a list of options to present to the president, including fresh sanctions, closing consulates and expelling Russians from the U.S., according to two people familiar with the matter. Trump has been asking aides what allies -- including France and Germany -- are doing in response to the attack, conducted with what the U.K. says was a Soviet Union-designed nerve agent.\n\n        \n        Earlier this week, McMaster briefed Trump for a call with Vladimir Putin and didn\u2019t warn against offering congratulations on the Russian leader\u2019s election win, according to three people familiar with the matter.\nWritten guidance prepared for the president by White House advisers ahead of Tuesday\u2019s phone call explicitly cautioned against complimenting Putin. But in a verbal briefing he personally delivered to Trump before the call, McMaster didn\u2019t emphasize what not to say about the election, said the people, who discussed the matter on condition of anonymity.\nTrump likely didn\u2019t read the written guidance before speaking with his Russian counterpart, and he ended up offering good wishes to Putin on his re-election. That congratulatory message -- uttered as the U.S. considers a tougher stance toward Moscow -- prompted sharp criticism from senior Republican lawmakers and intensified tensions among White House aides involved in Russia matters.\nMcMaster\u2019s omission may not have made much difference. By the time the call was set up at Trump\u2019s request, two of the people said, most of the president\u2019s advisers widely believed their boss wanted to congratulate Putin and would have ignored any advice to the contrary.\nThe administration\u2019s stance toward Russian President Vladimir Putin had been the source of friction between McMaster and Trump. Last month, McMaster echoed the sentiments of top U.S. intelligence officials who told Congress that Russians are targeting the 2018 elections with potential cyber attacks and efforts to sow political division.\nTrump Conflict\u201cThe evidence is now really incontrovertible and available in the public domain, whereas in the past it was difficult to attribute,\u201d McMaster said on Feb. 17, after Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted a Russian \u201ctroll farm\u201d and its operators for an alleged covert social media campaign to influence the election.\nMcMaster called the Russian actions as described in the indictment a \u201csophisticated form of espionage.\u201d\nTrump rebuked him on Twitter, saying McMaster \u201cforgot\u201d to say that the results of the election weren\u2019t changed by the Russian meddling -- something the indictment didn\u2019t address -- and that the only collusion was between the Russians, Clinton and Democrats.\n\n        \n        During his 30-minute call with Putin Trump didn\u2019t mention such sensitive issues as the U.K. poisoning or ongoing concerns over Russian interference in U.S. elections. He conducted the conversation while alone in the White House residence, though some Trump aides were on the line. There has been some second-guessing in the White House that Trump was left without the proper staffing support at his side for this call.\nSenator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, assailed Trump\u2019s outreach to the Russian leader.\n\u201cAn American president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections,\u201d McCain said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cAnd by doing so with Vladimir Putin, President Trump insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election to determine their country\u2019s future.\u201d\nLater, the Washington Post reported that written guidance for Trump had advised him not to congratulate Putin.\nMcMaster, an Army lieutenant general, had been the focus of recent speculation that he would soon leave as Trump reshaped his foreign policy team. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly was said to be in consultations with Pentagon officials about finding a command that would have allowed McMaster to obtain a fourth star. In a statement released by the White House after his departure was announced, McMaster said he would retire from the military this summer.\nLater Thursday night, after Trump announced his replacement, McMaster attended a dinner for visiting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Washington and received a standing ovation after former Florida Governor Jeb Bush pointed him out in the crowd from the stage.\n\u2014 With assistance by Nick Wadhams", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Henry Meyer", "body": "Russian election observers denounced what they said were large-scale violations in the presidential vote that handed Vladimir Putin a crushing victory, including ballot-stuffing that was captured on state-controlled cameras.\nGolos, an election-monitoring organization, said it registered more than 1,500 violations in regions across Russia. Several cases of people stuffing ballot boxes at polling stations, including near Moscow, were recorded on cameras set up by the authorities to ensure a transparent vote.\nOpposition leader Alexey Navalny said data compiled by his observers at polling stations showed that the official turnout of 67.5 percent was inflated by 10 percentage points.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan has crushed peaceful protests at home and abroad, closed newspapers, threatened American soldiers, and collectively scapegoated Kurds. But over the weekend, Erdogan managed to go even lower.\nAt a rally at Kahramanmaras, the Turkish leader brought a trembling 6-year-old girl on stage dressed in military garb and told her she would be honored if she died as a martyr. He sounded like a terrorist. We expect this kind of child abuse from the fanatics in Hamas or Hezbollah. Erdogan though is the leader of an important NATO ally.\nTurkey is beginning to resemble Pakistan, a perpetually failing state whose military leadership has tolerated and advanced a vision of political Islam deeply hostile to U.S. and Western interests.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        To be sure, Turkey is not quite there yet. There is still a majority of Turks who want to eventually join the European Union. The Turkish economy is stronger than Pakistan's, and its banks are more trusted. And unlike in Pakistan, the driving force to further Islamize society has come from Erdogan, an elected leader, not the military. Indeed, the Turkish military has (until some of Erdogan's recent reforms) historically been a force that undermined the elected leadership through coups to preserve the secular tradition of modern Turkey's founder, Kemal Ataturk.\nThat said, Erdogan is following the Pakistani model in disturbing ways, according to Husain Haqqani, the former Pakistani ambassador to Washington. Haqqani, a former journalist, is in a unique position to evaluate this trend because he wrote the best history of how the Pakistani military embraced Islamic fundamentalism.\u00a0\nIn an interview Haqqani said Erdogan's approach was reminiscent of Pakistan's military dictator between 1978 and 1988, Zia ul-Haq. Like Zia, Erdogan has instituted legal and societal reforms to further Islamize society. In January, for example, he instituted a new plan to pour government money into Islamic schools.\n\"Erdogan has taken the Pakistani formula of mixing hard-line nationalism with religiosity,\" Haqqani said. \"Zia imposed Islamic laws by decree, amended the constitution, marginalized secular scholars and leaders, and created institutions for Islamization that have outlasted him. Erdogan is trying to do the same in Turkey.\"\nThe clearest parallel with Pakistan is Turkey's current approach to the war in Syria. In January, Erdogan launched a new offensive against America's Kurdish allies in Afrin. Even though the Turks have worked against the regime in Damascus, during the first weeks of that offensive they actually coordinated with their erstwhile adversaries in Syria.\n\n        \n        This is a less toxic version of Pakistan's broader approach to the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan. There, the Pakistani military and intelligence services have tolerated and at times encouraged a group known as the Haqqani Network (no relation to the ambassador) to become a lifeline for the Afghan Taliban and other terrorists attacking U.S. forces and the elected government in Kabul. At the same time, the Pakistanis have been important allies for the U.S. dating back to the Islamic insurgency against the Soviets in Afghanistan, and more recently against elements of al Qaeda since 2001. Of course when the U.S. finally tracked down Osama bin Laden, it found him living in the same town as Pakistan's prestigious military academy, Abbottabad.\nAgain, Turkey has not yet sunk to this level. But it's heading down this path. In the first years of the Syrian civil war after 2011, Turkey's border with that country was a sieve for new Islamic State recruits joining the short-lived caliphate in Raqqa. To this day, Turkey remains a friendly outpost for Hamas, the terror group that has run Gaza since 2007.\nAs a former U.S. ambassador to Turkey, Eric Edelman, told me this week: \"Turkey is not Pakistan yet, but if it continues on the trajectory that Erdogan has put it on, there is a prospect it could become like Pakistan.\"\u00a0\nThis is the deep challenge today for Washington. So far however the U.S. government has not shown Ankara the tough love necessary to stop Turkey's slide. The latest high-level visit for example, from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last month, sought to paper over Turkey's campaign in Afrin and Erdogan's recent threat to deliver an \"Ottoman slap\" to the U.S.\nThis kind of short-term thinking is understandable, but it doesn't address the slow-motion disaster happening now in Turkey. Here it's important, at the very least, to draw some boundaries for Erdogan and convey that he cannot maintain the current relationship with the U.S. if he crosses them. A good starting point would be to demand Erdogan stop threatening U.S. soldiers.\nIn the meantime, it's telling that Turkey and Pakistan are getting closer. Last week at a meeting of the Financial Action Task Force, the international body to counter money laundering, it was Turkey that helped counter a U.S. move to place Pakistani banks on a watch list for financing terrorism. Given the direction Turkey is heading, it looks like they are hoping Pakistan may one day return the favor.\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\nTo contact the author of this story:\n                Eli Lake     at elake1@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:\n                Philip Gray     at philipgray@bloomberg.net", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jennifer Epstein", "body": "President Donald Trump plans to sign a spending bill that funds the federal government for the next six months, according to two people familiar with the matter, reversing a veto threat he made earlier Friday.\nTrump\u2019s turnabout came after a meeting with Defense Secretary James Mattis, who advocated for the bill\u2019s increases in defense spending and wanted the relative certainty of six months of assured funding.", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Josh Eidelson", "body": "Several Democratic congressional campaigns have agreed to bargain collectively with the Campaign Workers Guild, a new union trying to organize election campaign staff in what may be a first for national politics.The CWG announced Monday that it had secured a union contract with the campaign of Wisconsin activist Randy Bryce, the leading Democratic challenger to Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan in this year\u2019s mid-term elections.Campaign staffers are the latest professional targets for labor organizers.\u00a0While overall U.S. unionization remained at a record-low 10.7 percent, last year saw membership in the overwhelmingly non-union professional and technical services sector grow by close to 90,000 members,\u00a0bringing the total number of unionized American workers to 14.8 million, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\u00a0\n        \n        \n        \n        The CWG\u2019s effort is a first for congressional campaigns, which are staffed largely by contract and short-term workers operating in what are often high-pressure work environments.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that it\u2019s exploitative work,\u201d said Rutgers University labor studies professor Janice Fine, who\u2019s worked on local and national election campaigns. \u201cIt\u2019s premised on the idea that young people will work 24-7 in a selfless--and often dangerously selfless--way, and that culture has been passed on for generations.\u201dAmong the issues the union said it seeks to take on are hours that approach eighty per week and wages that are below $15 an hour.Under the agreement with Bryce\u2019s campaign, workers will get paid time off and earn at least $3,000 per month.

While Trump has repeatedly singled out China as a key trade violator, his toughest actions such as withdrawing from an Asia-Pacific trade pact -- which excluded China -- and slapping tariffs on steel have undermined relations with allies more than with the world\u2019s second-biggest economy.\n\n        \n        While China presents measures to make its massive internal market more accessible to outsiders as part of its 40-year \u201creform and opening-up\u201d process, the current emphasis directly answers complaints that Trump and his advisers use to support their claim that the U.S. is being taken advantage of in trade. Li repeated a suggestion that the U.S. ease restrictions on exports of high-technology goods to China as a way to even the balance.\n\u201cIntellectual property rights will be fully protected,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope this important means to balance China-U.S. trade will not be missed because that would be missing the good opportunity for making more money.\u201d\nRead More: Top Xi Aide Is Said to Promise U.S. CEOs Action on Reform\nLi spoke at the conclusion of a two-week meeting that included amending the constitution to scrap term limits for President Xi Jinping, the biggest overhaul of financial regulation since 2003 and the appointment of Yi Gang as the first new central bank chief in 15 years.

The coalition includes groups of retailers and makers of everything from toys to wine, while the council represents companies including Amazon, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Facebook Inc. and Microsoft Corp.\nThe impact of U.S. trade actions will be manageable because much of China\u2019s exports to the U.S. are American-branded or from supply chains involving U.S. firms, constraining tariffs, especially for technology, electronics and telecommunications products, according to Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong.\n\u201cWhile China will surely respond, we continue to expect its response to be relatively restrained and our baseline scenario implies modest economic damage,\u201d Kuijs, a former International Monetary Fund economist, wrote in a report Tuesday. \u201cBut there are risks of more pronounced escalation, leading to significantly larger economic impacts.\u201d\nRead More: Spared Tariff Trauma, China Drugmakers Have Best Day in 3 Years\nLi held back from making counter-threats even as the rumblings from Washington again ratchet up the likelihood of a full-scale trade war.

Trump, meanwhile, unleashed a pair of tweets attacking the Federal Bureau of Investigation and James Comey, the FBI director he fired in May.\nThe comments were the latest sign that Trump has lost patience with the months-long investigation that\u2019s cast a dark shadow over his presidency.\n\n        \n        Trump\u2019s lawyers, who\u2019ve been negotiating terms for Mueller to interview the president, had assured their client for most of last year that the investigation would wrap up by the end of 2017, said a person familiar with the matter. Trump was talked out of firing Mueller back in June, but there are strong signals that the special counsel and his team of 17 prosecutors have at least several months more work ahead of them.\nTrump\u2019s personal lawyer, John Dowd. \n\nPhotographer: Louis Lanzano/Bloomberg\nFirestorm PossibleAny move to fire Mueller is expected to ignite a political firestorm in Washington. Democrats have warned of a constitutional crisis, and even most Senate Republicans have cautioned Trump against doing anything to curtail the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\nRepublicans were noticeably silent, though, in the immediate aftermath of the new calls from Trump and his lawyers to end the probe. It\u2019s unclear whether they would take steps to rein the president in if he took drastic action.\nMcCabe\u2019s firing also adds fresh fuel to Mueller\u2019s probe. Michael Bromwich, a former Justice Department attorney now serving as one of McCabe\u2019s lawyers, said that the veteran FBI agent was fired after the disclosure that he\u2019s a cooperating witness against Trump. McCabe documented his interactions with Trump in a series of memos, according to a person familiar with the matter, and those memos could play into Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\n        \n        Your Guide to Understanding the Trump-Russia Saga: QuickTake\n\n        \n        Now that McCabe has lost his job and possibly a substantial portion of the pension accrued in more than two decades with the FBI, he has little reason not to speak out -- starting with the lengthy statement Friday night where he noted that he could \u201ccorroborate former Director Comey\u2019s accounts of his discussions with the president.\u201d\nMcCabe is \u201ca loose cannon right now. Talk about a guy who has nothing to lose -- literally, nothing to lose,\u201d said Jeffrey Cramer, a former federal prosecutor who\u2019s now managing director of the international investigation firm Berkeley Research Group LLC. \u201cIf he was holding anything back out of loyalty to the FBI or a sense of duty, well that just walked out the door. If he has any information he hasn\u2019t revealed out of a sense of loyalty, that might be told now.\u201d\nComey, meanwhile, is about to embark on a high-profile publicity tour and series of television interviews to promote his memoir, \u201cA Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership,\u201d which is being released on April 17. \u201cMr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,\u201d Comey said Saturday in a tweet. \u201cAnd they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.\u201d\n\u2018No Collusion\u2019The White House on Saturday did nothing to clear up the confusion about Trump\u2019s stance toward Mueller\u2019s probe.\n\u201cI pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe\u2019s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier,\u201d Dowd said in an emailed statement early in the day.\nDowd quickly clarified that he was speaking for himself, not for the president. Even so, Trump cheered the firing of McCabe, calling the FBI corrupt, and claiming the House Intelligence Committee found \u201cthere was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.\u201d The full committee released no such finding, although Republicans on the panel said they found no evidence of collusion.\nSekulow\u2019s ShowThe White House didn\u2019t respond to multiple requests for comment. White House lawyers have said in the past they plan to cooperate fully with Mueller\u2019s probe, but Trump\u2019s other personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, has used his daily radio show to chip away at Mueller\u2019s investigation for months.\nThe show, which Sekulow has broadcast for more than two decades to an audience of more than 1.5 million daily listeners, has become a key venue for challenging the basis for Mueller\u2019s investigation. Sekulow has regularly attacked the credibility of McCabe and other FBI officials looking into Russian election meddling, as well as the use of a surveillance warrant against a Trump campaign adviser.\nDemocrats said they were alarmed by the latest attacks on the investigation.\n\n        \n        \u201cAny attempt by the president to obstruct or remove the special counsel would create a constitutional crisis and represent an attack on the core American principle that nobody, including the president of the United States, is above the law,\u201d warned Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware.\nThe president can\u2019t fire Mueller directly, since he answers to the Justice Department official who appointed him, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Usually a special counsel would report to the attorney general, but Sessions recused himself from the inquiry because he advised and supported Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. But Trump still has options.\nCan Trump Fire the Special Counsel? A QuickTake QA\nA series of potentially pivotal events are on the horizon for the investigation. Beyond a possible interview of the president, Mueller still hasn\u2019t had wide-ranging interviews with members of Trump\u2019s family who were witnesses to some of the issues he\u2019s investigating.\nWhile Mueller is believed to be nearing the end of his investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice, he may hold off on releasing any conclusion until other parts of his probe are settled, current and former officials said.\nMueller also appears to be looking into Trump\u2019s business, including asking witnesses about a proposed Trump Tower Moscow. The New York Times reported Mueller issued a subpoena for documents to the Trump Organization several weeks ago. Dowd had previously said it would be outside Mueller\u2019s mandate to probe into Trump\u2019s business dealings. He declined to comment on the subpoena.\nObstruction CaseGiven McCabe\u2019s role as an important witness with details about the firing of Comey, his termination could add to -- but not derail -- an obstruction of justice case, said William Yeomans, a 26-year Justice Department veteran who\u2019s served as an acting assistant attorney general.\n\u201cIf anybody had any doubts about the integrity of this process, they were put to rest by the president\u2019s tweet, which basically announced he had forced this, and it was a good thing that this long-serving FBI employee who had done some wonderful things during his career was going to be forced out two days before he qualified for his retirement,\u201d Yeomans said in an interview.\nSessions fired McCabe ahead of his planned retirement on Sunday at age 50, a move that Trump celebrated on Twitter as a \u201ca great day for Democracy.\u201d Sessions said he was responding to a report by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general and finding by the FBI\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility. Those offices found that McCabe hadn\u2019t been fully forthcoming with investigators in discussing his contacts with a reporter, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nMcCabe, who joined the FBI in 1996, became a Republican target partly because he helped oversee the investigation into Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s email practices in 2016, even though his wife had accepted donations from Democratic political organizations during a losing campaign for the Virginia state Senate the previous year.\n\u201cHow many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife\u2019s campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation?\u201d Trump said on Twitter. \u201cHow many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!\u201d\n\u2014 With assistance by Chris Strohm, and Toluse Olorunnipa", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jennifer Jacobs", "body": "Aides Urge Trump to Expel Russian Envoys Over U.K. Attack\n            \n            By  and \n            \n            \n                \n        \n            \n        \n        March 23, 2018, 7:47 PM EDT\n    \n        \n    \n                \n            \n\n            \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n                                \n    \n            President Donald Trump\u2019s advisers are poised to recommend that he expel some Russian diplomats from the U.S. in response to the nerve-agent poisoning of a former Russian spy living in the U.K., a person familiar with the matter said.\nThe advisers reached the preliminary recommendations at a National Security Council meeting on Wednesday and honed them on Friday in a gathering that included Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, according to two people familiar with the meeting.\nTrump has not made a decision and is unlikely to do so before next week, one of the people said.\n\n        \n        A battle within the White House over how to best address the provocations of Russian President Vladimir Putin has been intensifying. The internal divisions flared this week after Trump congratulated Putin on his recent re-election without first reviewing written guidance that he not do so, a person familiar with the matter said.\nTrump has been reshaping his national security staff. On Thursday, he announced the departure of National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, who favored a tougher public posture toward Putin, and announced that he would replace him with John Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations known for his hawkish views. That move came just a week after the president fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who also took a more combative stance toward Russia, and nominated Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, to replace him.\nTrump faces pressure to take a stronger stance against Putin from Congress, which passed legislation in August giving lawmakers the power to block the president from lifting punitive measures imposed after Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine. Substantively, Washington\u2019s policy toward Russia has become tougher in recent months, though Trump\u2019s critics say he has dragged his feet in responding to Putin\u2019s provocations.\nTrump, who\u2019s aware of the disagreement among his aides, didn\u2019t mention such sensitive issues as the U.K. poisoning or continuing concerns over Russian interference in American elections during a 30-minute call with Putin.\nRelationship PriorityTrump has been willing to adopt increasingly tough policy stances on Russia. But the president places a priority on maintaining a personal relationship with the Russian president, won\u2019t publicly attack him, and doesn\u2019t see any benefit to the U.S. in confronting Putin in one-on-one encounters, one administration official said.\nTrump defended his call with Putin on Twitter Wednesday, dismissing those who \u201cwanted me to excoriate him.\u201d \u201cThey are wrong!\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cGetting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.\u201d\n\n        \n        Regardless of the president\u2019s own rhetoric, his administration sees the Kremlin as a threat.\nA national defense strategy assembled by the Pentagon under Defense Secretary James Mattis and publicly summarized in January described China and Russia as the top global adversaries of the U.S. Last week, the administration slapped financial sanctions against a St. Petersburg-based internet \u201ctroll farm\u201d and its alleged owner -- a close Putin ally -- whom Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted over a covert social media campaign to influence the 2016 U.S. election.", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "David Voreacos", "body": "Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a former associate were indicted for a second time on new charges including failure to report income to tax authorities, in a move that could increase the pressure on them to cooperate with the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\nManafort and his former deputy, Rick Gates, were, accused in an October indictment of laundering millions of dollars earned while acting unregistered agents of the Ukrainian government.

A Democratic takeover of the Senate will be harder to achieve.\n\n\u201cWe are all very sensitive to the political environment we\u2019re in,\u201d said Oklahoma Representative Tom Cole, who led House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm in 2008. Republicans are girding for an \u201cextraordinarily competitive\u201d election.\n\nEven if only one chamber flips to the Democrats, Trump\u2019s ability to impose his agenda would be thwarted, and his administration almost certainly would find itself pinned down by investigations and subpoenas from congressional committees.\n\nAn analysis by Bloomberg Government of historical data, election maps and public polling points to sweeping Democratic gains in the November election, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate are on the ballot.\n\nSince the end of World War II, the party in control of the White House has, on average, had a net loss of 26 House seats in midterm elections. Democrats can win control of the House with a net gain of 24 seats in November. They\u2019d need to win two seats to gain a majority in the Senate.\n\nAdding to that, Trump\u2019s approval rating at this stage of his presidency, 36 percent, is lower than any of his predecessors going back to Harry Truman, according to Gallup polling data. The less popular the president, the more seats his party tends to lose.\n\nThat translates to \u201ca very poor chance of bucking the midterm odds if it holds at this level,\u201d Republican pollster Lance Tarrance wrote in a Jan. 5 analysis for Gallup. \u201cTrump\u2019s 20-point approval deficit in recent Gallup polling does not bode well for him, in part because none of the past five presidents saw an increase in their approval rating in the year before their first midterm.\u201d\n\nRepublicans do hold some cards. Those include favorable electoral maps drawn by Republican-dominated state governments after the last census. GOP candidates also should be able to run on solid U.S. economic growth, a 26 percent surge in the S&P 500 Index since Trump took office and an unemployment rate that stood at 4.1 percent at the end of the year.\n\nYet none of the good economic news has budged Trump\u2019s stubbornly low approval ratings so far, or what polls show is a sour public view of the direction of the country.\n\nIn that environment, Democratic candidates are swarming to run in Republican-held districts and drawing donors. Through the end of September, 145 House Democratic challengers to 73 Republicans raised at least $100,000, according to the Campaign Finance Institute. At a similar point in 2015, 35 Democratic challengers to 25 incumbent Republicans raised more than $100,000.\n\nRepublicans currently hold a 238-to-193 edge in the House, with four vacancies, and a 51-to-49 advantage in the Senate, but there\u2019s a lot of turnover in their ranks. There are 39 House Republicans who\u2019ve announced they\u2019ll retire or leave to run for another office, or have resigned for other reasons. Several of them are in districts won by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race. Among Democrats the number of departures is 16.\n\nThree Senate Republicans aren\u2019t running for re-election. Two of them, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee, publicly split with Trump and likely would have faced significant primary challenges from the party\u2019s right wing, highlighting some of the ideological splintering among Republicans.\n\nThe off-year and special elections conducted since Trump took office underscore the Republican challenges.\n\nDemocrats won governors\u2019 offices by wide margins in New Jersey and Virginia while also capturing Republican seats in both states\u2019 legislatures, as suburban voters shifted to Democratic candidates. In Alabama, Doug Jones became the first Democrat elected to the Senate from the state in 25 years in a race that featured a scandal-tarred and controversial Republican who divided his own party, even though he had Trump\u2019s endorsement.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s three pretty big canaries in the coal mine that ought to warn you that you\u2019re headed into a turbulent period in the next election,\u201d Cole said.\n\nAnother indicator comes up on March 13 in a special election for a House seat in southwestern Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump won the district by 20 percentage points and Democrats didn\u2019t field a candidate there in the last two elections. But the Republican Party is investing heavily to hang on to it. Trump paid an official visit there on Jan. 18, and both Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan are set to help the Republican candidate, Rick Saccone, raise money. If Saccone barely squeaks by, and certainly if Democrat Conor Lamb wins, it would be a shift of momentum that other campaigns will take seriously.\n\nDemocrats improved their showing in well-educated, historically Republican areas in the 2016 and 2017 elections, so some hard-fought races in the fall will be in the suburbs. Among the House districts that may be in play are those of Representatives Rodney Frelinghuysen and Leonard Lance in New Jersey, John Culberson in the Houston area, Barbara Comstock in the Virginia suburbs near Washington, and Peter Roskam in the Chicago area.\n\n\u201cI would not want to be an incumbent Republican member of Congress going into these midterms, especially in a suburban swing community,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a former deputy executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the political arm of House Democrats. \u201cIt is a toxic brew of typical midterm rejection of the party in power, combined with a historically unpopular president and a historically unpopular congressional agenda.\u201d\n\nLittle public polling is done for individual House races. But one indicator is the generic ballot preference question on national polls that asks voters whether they would prefer a Democratic or Republican candidate in their district. In the average of polls compiled by RealClearPolitics, Democrats have held a steady lead that\u2019s currently at 7.9 percentage points.\n\nLook for Republican candidates in competitive districts to emphasize local issues and legislative accomplishments for their home areas while also highlighting their independence from Trump, if he remains unpopular.\n\n\u201cYou need to have an identity that is different than just being a generic Republican congressman,\u201d Cole said.\n\nTargets for Democrats include the 23 districts that voted in 2016 for Clinton and for a House Republican. Seven are in California. There are another 12 Republican-held districts that Trump won but had voted to re-elect Democratic President Barack Obama in 2012. Seven of those are in New York and New Jersey.\n\nRepublicans have far fewer opportunities on offense and will look to offset expected losses by targeting some of the 12 districts that voted for Trump and a House Democrat in 2016.\n\nIn the Senate, where one-third of members come up for election every two years, Republicans may cling to their majority only by the good fortune of a friendly map.\n\nDemocrats have 26 of their seats on the line in November compared to just eight for Republicans\u2014one of the most politically skewed Senate-election maps in history.\n\nTen of the 26 Democrats are from states Trump won in 2016. Five are defending seats in states the president won by at least 18 percentage points. They include Senators Joe Manchin in West Virginia, whose Republican opponents include Representative Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey; Claire McCaskill of Missouri, challenged by state Attorney General Josh Hawley; and Indiana\u2019s Joe Donnelly, who likely will face either Luke Messer or Todd Rokita, both House members.\n\nDemocrats are seeking to unseat Dean Heller in Nevada, the only state Trump lost in 2016 where a Republican is defending a Senate seat. Democratic Representative Jacky Rosen is opposing Heller, who also faces a primary challenge from Danny Tarkanian, a businessman and frequent candidate.\n\nThe Democrats are also making a serious takeover bid in Arizona, where Flake is eschewing a re-election bid in a state Trump won by 3.5 percentage points. The likely Democratic nominee is Representative Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nDemocrats face longer odds but have credible candidates in the more heavily Republican states of Texas, where Ted Cruz is seeking a second term, and Tennessee, where Corker is retiring.\n\nFor all of their challenges, House Republicans can cling to a few mitigating forces that could give them hope of holding off a Democratic wave.\n\nKey among them are structural advantages in the electoral map.\n\nRepublicans dominated state-level elections in 2010, giving them the upper hand when congressional districts were redrawn after the last national Census. They concentrated Democratic voters to create overwhelming Democratic majorities in the core of bigger metropolitan areas but with fewer seats. Republican votes, by contrast, are more efficiently distributed over a broader number of congressional districts.\n\nThat was illustrated in the presidential election.

I hope this means Chairman Grassley will move forward with public hearings for Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner, which we agreed to pursue last year,\u201d she said in a statement.Grassley had threatened to subpoena Trump Jr., among others, to testify, before announcing an agreement in July of last year for a staff interview \u201cprior to a public hearing.\u201dThe Iowa Republican hasn\u2019t yet ruled out compelling Kushner or Trump Jr. to appear in public through a subpoena, something Feinstein and other Democrats have been prepared to do for months.

However, if one scratches beneath the surface of these assertions, it\u2019s clear that Putin faces a growing number of complex challenges that are likely to deepen in the coming months and gradually erode his political momentum. Here are a few that will be the most difficult for him to overcome.\nIn Syria, as I wrote last year, Russia is increasingly stuck on both the military and diplomatic fronts. On the battlefield, Putin has repeatedly boasted that Russia\u2019s military goals in Syria have been accomplished -- the defeat of extremist groups threatening the regime of Bashar al-Assad -- and that he soon plans to draw down Russian military forces. However, given the chaotic situation on the ground -- the Assad regime still controls only about one-third of the country -- that seems unlikely anytime soon.\nThe cost of Moscow\u2019s presence in Syria, meanwhile, continues to grow. In the past few weeks, the Russians have suffered the crash of a military transport with several senior officers on board, the downing of a Russian fighter jet by anti-government forces, a clash involving American-backed forces and Russian mercenaries that produced dozens of Russian casualties, and an attack by insurgents using drones on two of its bases. The latter reportedly damaged several Russian aircraft, and is likely to be repeated in the coming months.\n\n        \n        \n        \n        There are also, despite recent regime advances, still thousands of Islamic State and al Qaeda-affiliated extremists operating in Syria, as well as many thousand embittered and heavily armed opponents of the Assad regime, who will never accept his legitimacy. A question: Is it likely that Assad\u2019s political opponents will embrace a spirit of political reconciliation in the wake of the regime\u2019s brutal conduct in the ongoing Eastern Ghouta campaign?\nOn the diplomatic front, meanwhile, Putin had hoped his 2015 military intervention would pave the way for Moscow to play a lead role in negotiating a final resolution to the civil war -- one that would bolster Russia\u2019s diplomatic influence regionally and secure its defense and commercial interests in Syria in the post-conflict reconstruction phase. Instead, it\u2019s crystal clear, and has been for some time, that Assad has no intention of negotiating his departure from office, that the opposition will never trust him, and that countries such as Turkey and Iran have their own distinct visions for Syria\u2019s future, and their roles in it.\nFinally, there is no chance that the U.S. and the West will provide major reconstruction aid to Syria as long as Assad is in power. This is especially problematic for Assad (and Putin) given that America\u2019s Kurdish-backed allies now control most of the critical oilfields in Eastern Syria. Therefore, it\u2019s a safe bet that Assad is unlikely to have sufficient money to begin rebuilding Syria\u2019s badly damaged infrastructure in the near future, even though this is critical to ensuring his long-term political viability. So, while Russia had hoped by this point in the conflict to present a bill to Assad for services rendered, it may instead be presented with a tab for money owed. Nearly three years on from Russia\u2019s military intervention, then, Putin is discovering that playing both fireman and arsonist in Syria is a difficult needle to thread.\nIf Syria is a mess, how about the situation in Eastern Ukraine? For Putin, that\u2019s not looking good either. Despite periodic spikes in fighting over the past few months, the front lines (as well as the negotiations for a political settlement) have been largely static. So, even if Putin (at least for now) has succeeded in preventing Kiev from pursuing closer integration with the West, the cost is steep and growing steeper by the month.\nRussia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine is continuing to prompt punishing economic sanctions from the U.S. and its European allies with no relief in sight. This at a time when Russia\u2019s economic growth is already anemic (the World Bank forecasts GDP growth of below 2 percent through 2019) and with 20 million or so Russians already living below the official poverty rate of $180 per month. Even more ominous, the loss of access to U.S. and Western technology and investment over such an extended period is going to erode Russia\u2019s long-term economic competitiveness.\n\n        \n        It\u2019s also worth noting that Russia\u2019s intervention is steadily undermining traditionally high public sentiments toward Russia in Ukraine. According to recent polling, more than 60 percent of young Ukrainians now believe that Moscow is responsible for the escalation of the conflict, while only five percent blame Kiev. In short, Putin is steadily turning the next generation of Ukrainians against Russia.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. has finally announced plans to provide Kiev with so-called lethal defensive aid including more than 200 Javelin anti-tank missiles and 37 launch units in the coming weeks. This equipment will certainly help Ukrainian units counter the old-model tanks that Moscow has provided to the separatists in recent years. As in Syria, then, Russia is finding that intervening in the Ukraine conflict was far easier than extricating itself.\nIn the run-up to the election, Putin trumpeted Russia\u2019s resurgence under his leadership, skillfully portrayed Russia as a victim even as it acted aggressively abroad, spoke publicly (and menacingly) of Russia\u2019s newfound military prowess, and engaged in a series of brazen acts, most notably the reported nerve agent attack against two Russians residing in England. If he intends to govern in his next term according to this script, the U.S. and its allies will have little choice but to push back hard.\nSome of the options that policymakers might consider include: new and creative ways to raise the military cost to Russia for its foreign interventions; sweeping policies to further curb Russia\u2019s access to advanced technology; measures to eliminate the ability of Putin\u2019s cronies to hide money abroad; active cyber operations against Russian entities involved in hacking; and aggressive public messaging efforts to highlight Putin\u2019s anti-democratic actions and expose the sources of his vast personal wealth, especially to audiences inside Russia.\nIt seems clear to me\u00a0 -- \u00a0I'm currently on a government-funded fellowship and these\u00a0opinions are solely mine\u00a0 --\u00a0all this adds up to a daunting set of challenges Putin faces in the coming years. And it\u2019s certain that provoking a more intense and direct confrontation with the West is not going to make his job any easier.\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\nTo contact the author of this story:\n                Michael Dempsey     at mdempsey@cfr.org\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:\n                Tobin Harshaw     at tharshaw@bloomberg.net", "link": null, "source": "Bloomberg", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}]
