[{"author": "Tamara Keith", "body": "Trump Admits To Making Up Trade Deficit In Talks With Canadian Prime Minister\n\nIn audio of a closed-door fundraiser obtained by the Washington Post and NBC News, President Trump boasts to donors that he \"had no idea\" whether he was correct when he insisted to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the U.S. has a trade deficit with Canada.\n\nIt doesn't. In fact, according to the U.S. Trade Representative in 2016, the U.S. had a $12.5 billion goods and services trade surplus with Canada. Trump sometimes ignores trade in services, which pumps up trade deficit numbers, but that isn't an accurate way to look at the U.S. trade relationship with other countries.\n\nAs she tried to explain why Trump had been right all along, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders cited trade in goods alone, leaving out trade in services. Services make up a significantly larger share of the US economy than goods production. And it isn't clear from Trump's remarks whether that is really what he was talking about.\n\nTrump was in the midst of a 30-minute speech at a fundraiser in St. Louis on Wednesday when, according to the Washington Post write-up, he riffed on a conversation he'd had with Trudeau.\n\n\" 'Trudeau came to see me. He's a good guy, Justin. He said, \"No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,\" ' Trump said, mimicking Trudeau, according to audio of the private event in\u00a0Missouri obtained by The Washington Post. 'Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in \u2014 \"Donald, we have no trade deficit.\" He's very proud because everybody else, you know, we're getting killed. ... \" 'So, he's proud. I said, \"Wrong, Justin, you do.\" I didn't even know.\u00a0... I had no idea. I just said, \"You're wrong.\" You know why? Because we're so stupid. ... And I thought they were smart. I said, \"You're wrong, Justin.\" He said, \"Nope, we have no trade deficit.\" I said, \"Well, in that case, I feel differently,\" I said, \"but I don't believe it.\" I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, \"Check, because I can't believe it.\" ' \"\n\nThis caught-on-tape moment comes less than a week after Trump signed proclamations putting stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Those tariffs won't immediately apply to Canada and Mexico, as those countries are in the midst of renegotiating, along with the U.S., the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Based on other comments, Trump is planning to leverage the threat of tariffs to negotiate better trade terms with U.S. trading partners.\n\nIt's not clear how this admission that the president contradicted another world leader without basis will affect future negotiations or relationships with Trudeau and other leaders. A failure to agree on basic facts would seem to make such negotiations more difficult.\n\nAsked by reporters during a photo opportunity in the Oval Office whether he has always been truthful with Trudeau, Trump ignored the question.\n\nBut he is standing by his assertion that the U.S. has a trade deficit with Canada, tweeting Thursday morning, \"P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn't like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and that's how I know!\"\n\nCanada is America's second-largest goods trading partner, according to U.S. data. Trade with Canada supported some 1.6 million jobs in the U.S., according to 2015 Commerce Department figures.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Canadian government declined to comment on Trump's remarks and directed NPR to a tweet from the Canadian ambassador to the U.S., David MacNaughton, who cited the same American figures.\n\nThis is far from the first time Trump has inaccurately described the trade relationship with America's neighbor to the north.\n\nIn a December New York Times interview, Trump claimed that \"[We lost] $17 billion with Canada \u2014 Canada says we broke even. But they don't include lumber and they don't include oil. Oh, that's not. ... [Inaudible] ... My friend Justin [Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister] he says, 'No, no, we break even.' I said, 'Yeah, but you're not including oil, and you're not including lumber.' When you do, you lose $17 billion, and with the other one, we're losing $71 billion.\"\n\nNPR's Domenico Montanaro fact-checked this at the time. It is entirely unclear where Trump got his numbers. In a recent paper, Canada-based researchers said that if energy exports are excluded, the country runs a $78 billion manufacturing trade deficit with the United States.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Philip Ewing", "body": "Trump National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster To Resign, Be Replaced By John Bolton\n\nNational security adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster is leaving the Trump administration, the president announced on Twitter Thursday evening. \"I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend,\" the president wrote. Trump also said former Amb. John Bolton will replace McMaster in a change that takes effect April 9.\n\nThe planned change at the top of the country's national security infrastructure comes after McMaster had an unsettled tenure inside a White House that recently has been expelling its top officials like a deflating balloon.\n\nIn a separate statement, McMaster said he was requesting retirement from the U.S. Army effective this summer. \"I am thankful to President Donald J. Trump for the opportunity to serve him and our nation as national security advisor,\" McMaster said. \"I am grateful for the friendship and support of the members of the National Security Council who worked together to provide the President with the best options to protect and advance our national interests.\"\n\nMcMaster was a storied Army field commander who became a well-known skeptic about bureaucratic indecision at the highest levels in Washington, D.C.\n\nHe enjoyed support from some in top posts, including Defense Secretary James Mattis, when Trump began searching for a replacement for his disgraced first national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn.\n\nFlynn was one of Trump's first close political advisers and an early joiner in his upstart political campaign, but he was forced out over his role in the Russia imbroglio. Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russia's then-ambassador to the United States.\n\nSo Trump, who never served in the military and never held elected office, needed another counselor and, in a relatively rare decision, picked an active-duty Army general in McMaster.\n\nMcMaster and Trump at first appeared simpatico in broad aspects of their worldview. They wanted a United States that mixed it up with competing world powers, throwing geopolitical elbows to gain advantage in the way they saw other nations throwing theirs.\n\nIt fell to McMaster, however, to translate Trump's doctrine on Inauguration Day about \"America First\" into one that could comport with the country's many important global alliances.\n\nThat's what led to the corollary that \"America First\" didn't mean \"America Alone,\" but it did mean that the U.S. wanted to be a contender as much as a leader.\n\n\"The president embarked on his first foreign trip with a clear-eyed outlook that the world is not a 'global community' but an arena where nations, nongovernmental actors, and businesses engage and compete for advantage,\" McMaster wrote with Trump's then-chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn \u2014 who has also since stepped down.\n\n\"We bring to this forum unmatched military, political, economic, cultural, and moral strength. Rather than deny this elemental nature of international affairs, we embrace it,\" the two men also wrote.\n\nBut if Trump liked that vision, he apparently grew to dislike McMaster.\n\nAccording to inside accounts, the two men clashed when McMaster's cerebral briefings crashed into Trump's more freewheeling style.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, was bitterly disappointed with what he considered a lack of meaningful new options from McMaster and the Pentagon on the quagmire in Afghanistan.\n\nRather than turning the conflict around sharply or cutting bait altogether, as Trump had considered, the White House made an open-ended commitment to Afghanistan that simply removed any pretense of an end date from the nation's longest war.\n\nThen there were the reports \u2014 always sourced on background \u2014 that McMaster was among those top advisers privately contemptuous of Trump's fitness for the job. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reportedly called Trump a \"moron,\" and lost his job. McMaster reportedly said Trump had \"the intelligence of a kindergartner\" and now has lost his job.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Brian Naylor", "body": "Russia Hacked U.S. Power Grid \u2014 So What Will The Trump Administration Do About It?\n\nWhen President Trump phoned to congratulate Russian President Putin on his re-election Wednesday, he made no mention of one of the latest irritants between Russia and the West \u2014 his administration's announcement that Russia successfully hacked the U.S. power grid.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security and the FBI issued a joint alert last week: \"Russian government cyber actors\" have been targeting U.S. critical infrastructure sectors including energy, nuclear and commercial facilities, since at least March 2016.\n\nThe announcement came the same day as the U.S. imposed sanctions against 19 Russian individuals and five entities for interfering in the 2016 election and other cyber intrusions.\n\nJames Lewis, a cybersecurity expert and vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the news Russia penetrated the energy grid does not exactly come as a surprise.\n\n\"The Russians have been doing this for years,\" Lewis said. \"The change is that the U.S. government came out and said the Russians hacked the utilities.\"\n\nThe government informed electric companies last summer that Russia undertook what DHS calls a \"multistage intrusion campaign\" against the utilities, using common hacking techniques such as malware, and spear phishing. It was able to to gain access to at least one power plant's control system.\n\n\"They were not simply looking around that system and reconnoitering it,\" Joel Brenner, former head of counter intelligence under the Director of National Intelligence in the Obama administration, told NPR. \"They were placing the tools that they would have to place in order to turn off the power. That's a serious vulnerability for us and we're not anywhere near ready to deal with it.\"\n\nThe Russians have targeted other countries' electrical grids, most notably Ukraine, in 2015, disrupting power for more than 200,000 people.\n\nScott Aaronson, vice president of security and preparedness at the Edison Electric Institute, which represents the nation's electric companies, said U.S. power companies have tried to learn from that attack.\n\nCan Americans feel confident the U.S. grid is protected?\n\n\"Very much so,\" Aaronson claimed. \"The electric power sector takes a lot of different measures to protect our systems.\"\n\nThat includes operating power plants without digital controls, just like in the old days, he said.\n\n\"I tell people one of the best ways to protect against a cyber threat is to not rely on cyber assets,\" Aaronson said, adding that the U.S. power grid \"operated for the better part of the last century\" without digital controls.\n\nHe also said utilities can \"go back to a less-efficient means of operating but still keep the lights on.\"\n\nSome power companies also block emails and other Internet traffic from outside the country.\n\nBut protecting the grid is complicated by its decentralized nature, with public utility commissions in 50 states exercising some control.\n\nCritics say the Trump administration needs to take stronger steps to block these kinds of attacks from Russia. At a hearing Tuesday, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash. called the DHS alert a siren.\n\n\"Our energy infrastructure is under attack,\" Cantwell said. \"It's under cyber-attack, and we need to do much more to protect it as a national critical asset.\"\n\nCantwell wants the Trump administration to do an assessment of Russian cyber attacks against the electric grid. The Department of Energy is establishing a new Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, that will focus on energy infrastructure security.\n\nBut any retaliation in response to Russia's cyber incursion would be up to President Trump.\n\nBut, as Brenner points out: \"The president has not so far shown any inclination or any backbone in confronting repeated Russian provocations. And one can only ask why that is.\"\n\nBrenner added that Russian President Vladimir Putin is \"playing ju-jitsu with us.\"\n\n\"Nobody wants a war,\" he said, adding the hostilities taking place now \"are in the gray space between war and peace.\"\n\nCSIS' Lewis said absent a strong U.S. response to the Russian cyber incursions though, Russia is likely to continue its' behavior.\n\n\"The problem here is if we don't give the Russians the idea that doing something to us is bad, they may be tempted to do it,\" Lewis said.\n\nAnd while sanctions can function as somewhat of a deterrent to further intrusions, they also may not be enough.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Richard Gonzales", "body": "The Federal Emergency Management Agency, the federal government's first responder to floods, hurricanes and other natural disasters, has eliminated references to climate change from its strategic planning document for the next four years.\n\nThat document, released by FEMA on Thursday, outlines plans for building preparedness and reducing the complexity of the agency.\n\nThe document does not say what could be contributing to \"rising natural hazard risk,\" or what conditions could require the \"increased investments in pre-disaster mitigation.\"\n\nSimilarly, under a section about \"Emerging Threats,\" the document cites cybersecurity and terrorism.

Previously obscured by language and by sheer volume of tweets, Torshin has written numerous times about his connections with the NRA, of which he's a known paid lifetime member. NPR has translated a selection of those posts that document Torshin's relationship to the group.\n\nThese revelations come amid news that the FBI is investigating whether Torshin, the deputy governor of the Bank of Russia, illegally funneled money to the National Rifle Association to assist the Trump campaign in 2016, McClatchy reported in January.\n\nIn a letter to Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Senate intelligence committee, the NRA denied any wrongdoing and suggested the FBI is investigating Torshin, not the NRA. Neither the NRA nor Torshin responded to inquiries from NPR.\n\nInvestigations by Congress and the Department of Justice have revealed that the Russian government has sought to sharpen political divisions among American citizens by amplifying controversial social issues. Investigators have expressed concern about Russian links to the NRA, one of the most politically polarizing organizations in the U.S.\n\nTorshin is a former Russian senator and served as the deputy speaker of Russia's parliament for more than a decade. Known as a Putin ally, he also spent time on Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee, a state body that includes the director of Russia's internal security service and the ministers of defense, interior and foreign affairs.\n\nTorshin's use of NRA connections to open doors, and his 2015 claim to know Trump through the organization, raise new questions about the group's connections with Russian officials \u2014 at a time when the organization is being roundly criticized by its opponents, and at times the president himself, for being a factor in American gun violence.\n\nTranslation: \"For 15 years, I've traveled to the US with official delegations, and more often - privately. In this time, I NEVER HEARD ONE BAD WORD ABOUT RUSSIA!\"\n\nAmong his tens of thousands of tweets, Torshin also documented his attendance at every NRA convention between 2012 and 2016, only some of which have been previously reported.\n\nOn his verified Twitter account, Torshin talked about how he knew Donald Trump through the NRA, citing a connection at the 2015 convention. Responding to a tweet about comedian Larry David accusing Trump of being a racist, Torshin said he knew the businessman through the NRA, and defended him.\n\nTranslation: \"A comedian should make people laugh! Right? So he is trying! I know D. Trump (through NRA). A decent person.\"\n\n\"I saw him in Nashville\" in April 2015, Torshin added later, the date and site of the NRA's 2015 convention. Trump gave a speech at that convention, the outlines of which would become familiar as his stump speech throughout the 2016 presidential campaign. The White House did not respond to repeated requests for comment by NPR, but denied Trump has ever met Torshin to Bloomberg News in 2017.\n\nTorshin's attendance at the NRA convention in 2016 is where he reportedly met with Donald Trump, Jr.\n\nTorshin had made repeated attempts to meet with Donald Trump himself at that convention during the presidential election year, but there is no evidence of this occurring. A conservative activist with ties to Torshin aide Maria Butina reached out to the Trump campaign in 2016, saying that Russia was \"quietly but actively seeking a dialogue with the U.S.\" and would try to use the NRA convention to make \"first contact,\" the New York Times reported.\n\n\"Putin is deadly serious about building a good relationship with Mr. Trump,\" the activist, Paul Erickson wrote. \"He wants to extend an invitation to Mr. Trump to visit him in the Kremlin before the election.\" Erickson has business ties to Butina, having started an LLC with her in South Dakota.\n\nTorshin has used his repeated trips to NRA conventions to cultivate relationships with top NRA officials. And his Twitter account documents that he has personally met with every person who has been president of the NRA since 2012.\n\nOn Twitter, Torshin portrayed these meetings as more than merely casual encounters. In 2017, he tweeted that he was bringing a gift to then-NRA President Allan Cors, and suggested he was familiar with Cors' hobbies.\n\nTranslation: \"Bought a gift for NRA President Allan Cors. Tanks are his favorite topic!\"\n\nCors is the founder of the Virginia Museum of Military Vehicles, according to its website.\n\nIn a public DropBox album that Torshin linked to from his Twitter account, he's seen meeting with former NRA president Jim Porter, as well as former NRA president David Keene.\n\nHis tweets suggest a longtime relationship with Keene, who repeatedly appears in photos as Torshin documents his visits, suggesting that their meeting was not merely coincidental. Keene did not respond a request for comment.\n\nTorshin has also met the current president of the NRA, Pete Brownell. Brownell was part of an NRA delegation that visited Moscow in 2015.\n\nThese relationships that he cultivated appeared to open another door. Torshin came to the United States in 2012 as an international election observer, and watched as ballots were cast during the Obama-Romney presidential contest in Tennessee. This was possible, he wrote, due to his NRA links.\n\nTranslation: \"I was there at Obama's last election! The NRA card, to me as an observer from Russia, opened access to any [polling] station.\"\n\n\"Tennessee resident Kline Preston requested Mr. Torshin to be an international observer in November 2012,\" Adam Ghassemi, a spokesman for the Tennessee Secretary of State, told NPR. The Washington Post reported last year that Preston, a Tennessee lawyer, was the one who originally introduced Torshin to former NRA president David Keene back in 2011.\n\nThe heat is on the Russian politician, who was alleged by Spanish police to have directed financial transactions for the Russian mob. Not only is the FBI reportedly investigating him \u2014 the bureau declined to comment for this story \u2014 but lawmakers involved in congressional investigations have also expressed interest in Torshin.\n\nBoth the Senate and House intelligence committees are currently engaged in investigations into potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nWyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee and a member of the Senate intelligence committee, has demanded the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network hand over documents related to Torshin and the NRA.\n\n\"The NRA and its related entities do not accept funds from foreign persons or entities in connection with United States elections,\" NRA General Counsel John Frazer wrote in response to a request from Wyden to turn over documents related to transactions between the NRA and Russian citizens. \"NRA political decisions are made by NRA officers and executive staff, all of whom are United States citizens. No foreign nationals are consulted in any way on these decisions.\"\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, told NPR this week that the committee's members have asked relevant witnesses about the NRA through the course of their investigation.\n\n\"I can't go into what we've been able to learn thus far on that issue. I can tell you it's one of deep concern to me and to other members of the committee, that we get to the bottom of these allegations that the Russians may have sought to funnel money through the NRA,\" Schiff said. \"It would be negligent of us not to investigate.\"\n\nGlenn Simpson, the co-founder of research firm Fusion GPS, alluded to Torshin and the NRA during his closed-door testimony before the House intelligence committee in November.\n\n\"It appears the Russians, you know, infiltrated the NRA. And there is more than one explanation for why,\" Simpson told lawmakers. \"But I would say broadly speaking, it appears that the Russian operation was designed to infiltrate conservative organizations. And they targeted various conservative organizations, religious and otherwise, and they seem to have made a very concerted effort to get in with the NRA.\"\n\nNot only are congressional investigators interested in the NRA's relationship with Russia, but this inquiry comes as the NRA is receiving additional pressure from groups hoping to pass additional gun restrictions into law, and as dozens of American companies have cut ties with the NRA in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., shooting last month.\n\n\"These revelations suggest that for years the NRA courted a top Putin ally who is now reportedly attracting scrutiny from the FBI,\" John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, told NPR. \"NRA leaders still haven't explained their close relationship with Russian officials in Putin's orbit.

But by the time the candidate bounces through the door, they're unfolding dozens more chairs as the crowd zooms past 100.\n\nO'Rourke, who currently represents the El Paso area in the U.S. House, is running for the chance to unseat the Republican incumbent, Ted Cruz. No Democrat has represented the Lone Star State in the Senate since 1993, but O'Rourke believes he can beat the odds, in part by campaigning aggressively in every part of this sprawling state.\n\n\"Of the 254 counties [in Texas], we've visited 226 so far. This is 226 today,\" O'Rourke tells the crowd, who have been chanting, \"Beto, Beto!\"\n\nO'Rourke has his work cut out for him.

Cruz raised about $800,000 during the same period. \"I just haven't seen this kind of excitement and energy and willingness to do what it takes in Texas in my life,\" O'Rourke added.\n\nThat fundraising may help him make up for the lack of awareness Texas voters have of the Democrat, according to Texas Tribune executive editor and political analyst Ross Ramsey. \"I think he'll have enough money, whether they vote red or blue in November, Texans will know who Beto O'Rourke really is,\" Ramsey told NPR.\n\nO'Rourke is capitalizing on an extremely restive Democratic electorate. Although Texas Democrats have been largely shut out of statewide office for the past two decades, they've been closing the gap with Republicans. In 2016, Hillary Clinton got 600,000 more votes in Texas than Barack Obama did just four years earlier. President Trump won the state by about 9 percent.\n\nO'Rourke says the president has a lot to do with the energy among Democrats.\n\n\"They're coming out because they don't want a wall [with Mexico]. People are coming out because they don't want to hear the president refer the countries of Africa as 's***hole' nations,\" said O'Rourke. \"People are coming out because they don't think the press is the enemy of the people they think they're the best defense against tyranny. People are coming out because they want women to be treated with dignity and respect.\"\n\nThe tall, thin, 45-year-old O'Rourke sometimes gets described as a West Texas version of John F. Kennedy.

In a state where guns are sometimes seen as a birthright, he argues for universal background checks and an assault weapons ban.\n\nO'Rourke has two challengers in this Tuesday's upcoming Democratic primary, but had a 50 point lead in the latest polling.\n\nThis fall, it's likely O'Rourke will face Ted Cruz in the general election. Although Cruz's reputation with Republican voters suffered when he refused to endorse Donald Trump's nomination at the 2016 Republican National Convention, he is an accomplished fundraiser and formidable opponent.\n\nCruz's campaign did not respond to requests for comment, but Cruz is taking the race seriously.\n\nHe recently warned Houston-area Republicans, \"The left is going to show up.

The final turnout on Tuesday will be a better indication of where things sit.\n\n\"It's still a Republican state. It would take a lot of things to fall in place, but that said, up to this date O'Rourke has a lot of things going for him,\" Ramsey said.\n\nHe added that many Texas political observers are reminding themselves that they saw the rise of another long-shot Senate candidate six years ago.\n\nHis name was Ted Cruz.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Martina Stewart", "body": "Source: Fired Deputy FBI Director Took Memos, Notes About Interactions With Trump\n\nBefore Washington, D.C., had fully processed the late-night firing of Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who was let go by Attorney General Jeff Sessions less than 48 hours before his planned retirement after more than two decades of service to the bureau, the saga took several new, head-spinning turns Saturday.\n\nMcCabe took notes and memos about his interactions with President Trump, similar to those prepared by his former boss and colleague James Comey, a source familiar with the issue told NPR. The source also said the McCabe documents corroborate Comey's account \u2014 which could play a key role in Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into obstruction of justice.\n\nThe McCabe memos are now in the possession of special counsel Robert Mueller's team of investigators, according to CNN and Axios. And, McCabe already sat for an interview with Mueller's team, Axios also reported.\n\nA personal lawyer for the president pointed to McCabe's ouster to argue it was time for the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race and any ties between Russians and the Trump campaign.\n\nThe attorney's remarks \u2014 though not intended to speak for the president \u2014 set off yet another round of concern among congressional Democrats about the status of the special counsel investigation and possible ways to protect it \u2014 and its leader, former FBI Director Robert Mueller \u2014 from being terminated by the White House or the Justice Department.\n\nAnd, McCabe's onetime boss, former FBI Director James Comey, sparred directly on Twitter with the president, who fired Comey in May of last year. Comey, on the verge of releasing a book, told Trump soon the American people \"can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.\"\n\nSessions announced late Friday that he had terminated McCabe's employment with the FBI \"effective immediately.\"\n\nThe attorney general pointed to internal recommendations from the Justice Department's inspector general and the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility that found \"McCabe had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor \u2212 including under oath \u2212 on multiple occasions,\" Sessions said in a statement announcing the firing.\n\n\"The FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability. As the OPR proposal stated, 'all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand,' \" Sessions also said.\n\nBut McCabe said his firing was politically motivated. \"I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey,\" McCabe said in his own late-night statement Friday. The former FBI official said he had been targeted because he can \"corroborate former Director Comey's accounts of his discussions with the President.\"\n\nMcCabe's attorney said in his own statement that the White House has attacked McCabe since last year with the result of putting \"inappropriate pressure\" on Sessions to oust McCabe. \"This intervention by the White House in the DOJ disciplinary process is unprecedented, deeply unfair, and dangerous,\" attorney Michael Bromwich said.\n\nBromwich also argued that the process by which the termination decision had been made was unfair and had been rushed, limiting the time he and McCabe had to access, review and analyze the relevant evidence in order to prepare a response.\n\nThe \"concerted effort to accelerate the process in order to beat the ticking clock of [McCabe's] scheduled retirement violates any sense of decency and basic principles of fairness,\" Bromwich said. (Sessions, for his part, said the internal investigation of McCabe had been \"extensive and fair\" and undertaken \"according to Department of Justice Procedure.\")\n\nThe McCabe firing added yet more fuel to the Russia imbroglio, an at least year-long conflagration that never wants for oxygen in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"This will be known as the Friday night slaughter,\" presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said on CNN soon after news of the ouster broke. Brinkley was referencing President Nixon's infamous \"Saturday Night Massacre\" of several senior Justice Department officials during the Watergate scandal.\n\nA personal lawyer for Trump seized on the firing and suggested it should provide motivation for the Justice Department to end the Mueller investigation altogether.\n\nSaying his was speaking for himself and not for Trump, attorney John Dowd said in a statement emailed to NPR that \"I pray that [Deputy Attorney General Rod] Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe's boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier.\"\n\n\"Just end it on the merits in light of recent revelations,\" Dowd explained, apparently alluding to the internal investigation that had ended McCabe's FBI career just before he planned to retire.\n\nThe top Democrat in the Senate said Dowd's view reflected the inclination of the president and his legal team to undermine the special counsel rather than to cooperate with Mueller's investigation.\n\n\"The president, the administration, and his legal team must not take any steps to curtail, interfere with, or end the special counsel's investigation or there will be severe consequences from both Democrats and Republicans,\" Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also said in a statement Saturday.\n\nThe top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee saw Dowd's remarks as a call to action for his colleagues. \"Every member of Congress, Republican and Democrat, needs to speak up in defense of the Special Counsel. Now,\" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., posted on Twitter.\n\nAlongside the response to Dowd, lawmakers, partisans, political observers and journalists responded to the firing \u2014 with Trump leaving no doubt how he felt.\n\nThe occasion of McCabe's firing was \"a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy,\" the president said in an early morning tweet. Trump also used the online posting to take a swipe at former FBI Director Comey; the president called Comey \"sanctimonious\" and suggested Comey \"knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!\"\n\nA former director of the CIA under President Obama slammed Trump after the president praised McCabe's ouster. \"[Y]ou will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,\" John Brennan posted on Twitter. \"You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America...America will triumph over you.\"\n\n\"Gloat now, but you will be fired soon,\" Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a member of both the House intelligence committee and the House Judiciary Committee, told Trump. \"There's a storm gathering, Mr. President,\" Swalwell added, and it's going to wipe out you and your corrupt organization all the way down to the studs.\"\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said on Twitter that the firing was an attempt to undermine McCabe as a witness in the special counsel investigation and was \"added evidence of obstruction of justice.\"\n\nAnd Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a member of both the Senate intelligence committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee said the attorney general \"needs to testify immediately before the Judiciary Committee\" about McCabe's firing. \"He must explain the DOJ's process and whether this is an attempt to target, punish or silence those investigating Russia and the Trump campaign.\"\n\nBut Republican lawmakers said Saturday that McCabe's termination was justified.\n\n\"I applaud Attorney General Jeff Sessions for taking action and firing former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe prior to his scheduled retirement,\" Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in a statement. The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee added that \"more must be done to root out the problems at the FBI. I remain extremely troubled by the decisions made by the Bureau during the 2016 presidential election and the role senior FBI officials played in these questionable decisions and irregularities.\"\n\nAnd Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., another member of the House Judiciary Committee, said McCabe's firing was \"a rare example of someone being held accountable in Washington.\"\n\nAs is his habit, the president took to Twitter Saturday afternoon to once again deny that his campaign had not colluded with Russia, citing a recently announced conclusion by the House intelligence committee. In a seeming reference to McCabe's termination, the president added that \"As many are now finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State.\"\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the House intelligence committee's top Democrat, quickly pointed out that the conclusion there had been no collusion was confined to the committee's Republicans \u2014 who, Schiff told Trump, were \"more interested in protecting you than learning the truth.\"\n\nIn another tweet Saturday afternoon, the president again took on the former FBI deputy director. \"McCabe was caught, called out and fired,\" Trump said, adding \"How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!\"\n\nComey responded within minutes: \"Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon. And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.\"\n\nBut Saturday's development may have included a bright side for McCabe.\n\nIn an effort to help McCabe complete the amount of employment necessary to qualify for his pension, Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., offered McCabe a job. \"My offer of employment to Mr. McCabe is a legitimate offer to work on election security,\" Pocan said in a press release.\n\nThe Democratic lawmaker added: \"Finally, I'd like to thank Mr. McCabe for his years of service to the FBI and our country. He deserves the full retirement that he has been promised, not to have it taken away as a result of the President's political games.\"", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Tamara Keith", "body": "President Trump speaks during a Cabinet meeting on June 12, 2017.

His willingness to say \"you're fired\" to so many people, so early in his administration is just another way Trump is unlike those who have come before him.\n   No elected first-term president in the past 100 years has had this much Cabinet turnover this early in his presidency. And going back to Ronald Reagan, the churn in top-level staff in the Trump White House is off the charts.\n   \n   \n\n   \"There will always be change, and I think you want to see change,\" Trump said Thursday not quite tamping down the latest rumors of possible Cabinet departures. \"And I want to also see different ideas.\"\n   \n   \n\n   In just under 14 months on the job, Trump has had more Cabinet turnover than 14 of his predecessors had in their first two years. Trump has already tied Presidents Ford and Harding, with three departures each. Ronald Reagan had four Cabinet departures and they all came well into his second year in office. \n   The three Cabinet members Trump has already replaced are Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who was pushed out after controversy over flying in charter aircraft; Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who became chief of staff over the summer; and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson who was fired by tweet recently over policy and personality clashes.\n   \n   \n\n   Several other members of the Cabinet are either clouded in controversy over possible misuse of public funds or otherwise earning the ire of President Trump. Other presidents with early Cabinet turnover saw departures for entirely different reasons.\n   \n    \n\n    \n\n   \n   \n\n   Herbert Hoover's first War Secretary, James Good, died suddenly 258 days into his tenure. Franklin D. Roosevelt's first Treasury Secretary, William Woodin, fell ill, writing after just nine months on the job \"the state of my health will not permit me to remain in this position.\" He died a few months later.\n   Over the approximately 100-year period reviewed for this story, there were Cabinet shake-ups and shuffles, secretaries who departed to take on new roles either in the administration or on the Supreme Court. There were resignations amidst policy disagreements, and perhaps most remarkably there was an agriculture secretary who served in the job for less than 90 days, while waiting to take office as governor of West Virginia.\n   First term 'dream team'\n   Typically in the first two years, a president has his dream team Cabinet in place and they are working hard to enact his vision. Then midterm elections come, people get tired and Cabinet shake-ups begin.\n   \n   \n\n   \"Other presidents wanted to save face for themselves and not look like their Cabinet is in disarray,\" said James Pfiffner, explaining one of many possible reasons for the typical early stability in presidential Cabinets.\n   Pfiffner is a professor of public policy at George Mason University who specializes in presidents and their Cabinets. Also, he says most presidents have a political background and choose Cabinet members they know and are compatible with who have long-established histories navigating Washington, D.C. Trump's original Cabinet included a number of outsiders, perhaps most notably Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who came from ExxonMobil and who Trump didn't know beforehand.\n   \"President Trump doesn't pay much attention to tradition or usual decorum or norms of the presidency,\" Pfiffner said, pointing out that Trump puts a premium on personal rapport. \"And so he does what he feels like, and continues to.\"\n   \n   \n\n   For this analysis, NPR looked at the first two years of Cabinet departures for presidents going back to Woodrow Wilson. We didn't count holdovers from previous administrations (especially prevalent when a president took over following a death or resignation), instead focusing on Senate-confirmed secretaries in each president's first two years and how long they lasted. Which jobs are considered Cabinet positions has changed over time, so we opted to use the same definition as the U.S. Senate historian. This means Trump's chief of staff and CIA director aren't part of the count, and neither is the administrator of the Small Business Administration (a position presidents Clinton and Carter had to refill early on).\n   As to whether Trump's tally of turnover is likely to rise anytime soon, press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked whether the president had offered assurances about job security to VA Secretary David Shulkin or HUD Secretary Ben Carson.

Jeannette Rankin, went to Congress. Republican Gov. Phil Bryant appointed Hyde-Smith to fill the seat being vacated by Sen. Thad Cochran, who announced that he would resign as of April 1 due to poor health.\n\nHyde-Smith, currently the state's Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce, will officially take over the seat on April 2, setting a new record of 23 women in the Senate.\n\nThat will leave just one state \u2014 Vermont \u2014 that has never sent a woman to Capitol Hill.\n\nThe chart below shows the years in which each state sent its first woman to Congress.\n\nHaving sent a woman early to Congress doesn't necessarily mean a state continued a pattern of electing women. While Montana sent the first woman to Congress in 1917, it has not elected any women to Congress since.\n\nImportantly, this history does not show when voters in each state elected their first woman to Congress.\n\nIndeed, with Hyde-Smith's appointment, Mississippi continues a nearly century-long pattern. In many states, the first woman sent to Congress was appointed or elected in a special election for a seat vacated by a man (often, this was the woman's deceased husband).\n\nIn fact, it was just 40 years ago, in 1978, that the first woman was elected to the Senate without having previously finished someone else's term, according to the Rutgers Center for American Women and Politics.\n\nHyde-Smith won't serve long as an appointed senator; she will have a special election in November to serve out the rest of Cochran's term.

With conservative strategist Steve Bannon playing a founding role, backed by money from billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, the firm was able to develop data from 50 million Facebook users into a psychologically-based strategy to target voters.\n\nNow there are legal questions about how it obtained that Facebook data. Investigations are gearing up in the U.S. and the U.K. The company this week suspended its CEO, Alexander Nix, over comments he made to undercover reporters from the British Television 4 News.\n\nU.S. campaign finance law may have a lot to say about this. Here are some of the biggest questions.\n\n1. Did Cambridge Analytica have a role in running the Trump campaign?\n\nTo hear now-suspended CEO Alexander Nix in the Television 4 News report, his firm handled almost everything except those Make America Great Again caps. He claimed it was responsible for all of the data, research, analytics and targeting, plus the digital and television campaigns. Notably, he said, \"Our data informed all the strategy.\"\n\nBut as a British firm, Cambridge Analytica runs into a federal statute that bars foreign involvement in American elections. The law was strengthened after the 1996 Clinton re-election effort had to disgorge millions of dollars from illegal donors.\n\n\"The Federal Election Campaign Act's prohibition on foreign contributions is the broadest prohibition in the entire statute,\" said Brett Kappel, a partner in the government affairs and public policy practice of the law firm Ackerman in Washington, D.C.\n\nOne provision of the law prohibits foreign nationals from holding decision-making positions in American campaigns. So the Trump campaign could hire Cambridge Analytica, and the firm could recommend, say, an ad-targeting strategy for Wisconsin. But a campaign official \u2014 a U.S. citizen or green-card holder \u2014 would have to approve it.\n\nNix's comment seems to acknowledge that line; he's saying the firm stayed on the right side of it.\n\n2. Did Cambridge Analytica give or sell the data to the Trump campaign?\n\nIf the answer is yes, it would raise questions.\n\nThe Trump campaign paid the firm a total of $5.9 million, according to Federal Election Commission data processed by the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics. The campaign's filings say the firm provided data management and survey research. But estimates for how much the data is worth, as processed by Cambridge Analytica, run much higher.\n\nIf the firm gave the data, or sold it at less than fair market value, the transaction would amount to a campaign contribution \u2014 a two-fer violation of the law, which bars corporations and foreign nationals from contributing.\n\n3. Did Cambridge Analytica have any other clients?\n\nJust one of note: a superPAC called Make American Number 1. During the campaign it used the name Stop Crooked Hillary PAC. As that suggests \u2014 and as Cambridge Analytica executives indicated in the Channel Four report \u2014 the superPAC served as an attack dog to supplement the campaign's messages.\n\nAccording to that report, Cambridge Analytica treated the campaign and the superPAC as a single project. This might explain why Stop Crooked Hillary PAC paid the firm almost the same sum as the campaign \u2014 $5.7 million \u2014 for its services.\n\nCampaigns and superPACs are supposed to be independent of each other. But ironically, the seemingly sleazy arrangement is within the norms of American politics. While the two political entities cannot coordinate their messages, they can hire the same vendor. It's the vendor's duty to set up two teams, walled-off from each other and legally bound to maintain the separation.\n\n4. How much trouble is Cambridge Analytica in?\n\nNothing is proven yet, or even alleged. But it's worth noting that the Justice Department has a small set of \"core prohibitions\" around campaign finance issues that it is vigilant about prosecuting. The core prohibitions include the bans on corporate contributions and on foreign contributions and expenditures, both of which could put Cambridge Analytica in the department's sights.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kelsey Snell", "body": "Congressional leaders appear to have reached a deal on a $1.3 trillion spending package ahead of a midnight Friday deadline.\n\nThe must-pass budget behemoth was still in the works Wednesday afternoon, raising the possibility of the the need for another stop-gap funding measure otherwise a partial government shutdown would occur until the bill can pass Congress. The agreement is expected to be loaded with dozens of unrelated policies aimed at wooing skeptical lawmakers to back the deal.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans each claimed victories after days of partisan bickering over what extraneous provisions, known as \"riders,\" to tuck into the bill. They ultimately agreed to include improvements to the national gun background check system.\n\nThe bill also includes nearly $1.6 billion in border security increases without addressing a legal fix for the roughly 700,000 immigrants who stand to lose protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA, according to several aides familiar with the negotiations.\n\nIt's a common \u2014 if sometimes controversial \u2014 practice used by both parties and the president to jockey for their priorities because they are guaranteed to become law on a must-pass spending bill. Adding to the negotiating pressures this round is the looming midterm election, and the reality that the political season will soon overtake any ability to advance any additional major legislation before Election Day.\n\nThe underlying spending bill, which bundles together all 12 of the individual annual appropriations bills that fund the U.S. government into what is called an \"omnibus\" bill, was largely crafted with bipartisan input from the House and Senate Appropriations Committees in recent weeks.\n\nThe bill is expected to include$2.8 billion to battle opioid addition as well as major funding increases for the Department of Veterans Affairs, federal highway projects and high speed broadband development, the aides said.\n\nThe $1.3 trillion measure includes significant boosts to U.S. military spending supported by President Trump and congressional Republicans, while Democrats secured boosts to domestic spending most Republicans oppose. The domestic spending levels under this bill are higher than any spending Democrats achieved under President Obama.\n\nOne of the final sticking points was from the White House and the president's insistence that the measure include some measure of funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. The White House initially wanted $25 billion but Democrats pushed for a far smaller amount with explicit restrictions on how the money could be spent.\n\nThe final $1.6 billion agreement will fund new fencing along roughly 30 miles of the border that was already authorized under an earlier bill. Negotiators also reached a deal to repair existing fencing while explicitly protecting the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge in Texas, according to a source familiar with the deal.\n\nSome Democrats remain frustrated that the bill does not deal with immigration.

She knows very well that this race is considered a pretty safe bet for the GOP in November \u2014 the nonpartisan Cook Political Report lists it as a \"likely Republican\" win, meaning Republican incumbent Randy Hultgren has an excellent chance of holding onto his House seat.\n\n\"We're not in an average year, and I'm not an average candidate,\" she says. \"I think that that matters. What we've seen in elections out of Virginia and Texas and the special [election] in Pennsylvania is that the candidate and the quality of the election that they're running matters a lot in the election outcome.\"\n\nUnderwood is in good company. This year's unprecedented crop of women running for office includes a glut of women running in races that, to put it mildly, will be a challenge for them to win in November.\n\nAn NPR analysis shows that the influx of women candidates, beyond being heavily Democratic, features a glut of Democratic women running in races currently considered to be easy Republican wins.\n\nIn total, 49 percent of the Democratic women running for the House, Senate, and governor, not including incumbents, are in \"likely\" or \"safe\" Republican races. On the other side, 34 percent of Republican women running as non-incumbents are in likely or safe Democratic House, Senate, or governors' races.\n\nAnd even those running for seats that are within reach for their party will still have to get through sometimes crowded primaries.\n\nThe bottom line is that a wave of female candidates is going to equal a wave of women losing in 2018.\n\nImportantly, this doesn't necessarily make women unusual, according to an NPR analysis of the FEC's total candidate dataset. That data isn't perfect \u2014 it includes some candidates who filed but never made it to the ballot, for example \u2014 but it suggests that large numbers of men, particularly Democrats, have filed in districts that would be very difficult to win. Indeed, while the number of women running has increased substantially this year, the level of women as a share of all candidates has not increased all that much.\n\nInterestingly, the districts featuring female candidates followed a similar pattern in the last midterms \u2014 with many Democratic women likewise running in solid Republican districts \u2014 according to data from March 2014 provided to NPR by both the Cook Political Report and Rutgers' Center for American Women and Politics, or CAWP.\n\nBoth parties have seen increases in female candidates this cycle, though far more of the increase has been among Democratic women, who have been energized by their dislike of President Trump, as well as cultural forces like the #MeToo movement.\n\nThe large number of Democratic female candidates in those \"solid\" and \"likely Republican\" districts may reflect that energy, as women like Underwood hope to unseat staunch conservatives.\n\nTo be clear, the candidate field will narrow considerably in the primaries. Right now, according to the Rutgers data, there are 555 women in the running for 324 U.S. House, Senate or governors' races \u2014 a figure that includes incumbents, challengers and candidates in open races.\n\nBut in November, that wave of women will face its real numbers test.\n\nHow many women could be elected?\n\nOne way to look at the data: If a woman won every possible House race this November, women would occupy 264 House seats \u2014 well over half, and a roughly 150 percent bump from the current level of 106.\n\nBut take out all of those Democratic women in races that Cook considers \"solid\" or \"likely\" Republican and Republican women in \"solid\" or \"likely Democratic\" races, and there would be a potential 162 female House members. And that's potential \u2014 assuming all of those women won.\n\nTo be clear, this still gives women \u2014 particularly Democratic women \u2014 a good chance of picking up significant numbers of seats in November.\n\nToss-up races are one opportunity for this to happen. One easily overshadowed figure in the above charts is the number of women in toss-up races this year \u2014 twice as many GOP women as in 2014, and more than five times as many Democratic women.\n\nSome women will lose, though. And that's OK with Erin Vilardi, founder and CEO of VoteRunLead, a nonpartisan group that recruits and trains women to run for office. She says her group is \"coaching women to run to lose\" for a few reasons.\n\n\"One, you might actually win, because this is such a crazy election cycle in 2018,\" Vilardi says. \"No political pundit knows what voter turnout is going to be. Is it going to be 16 points higher [than the last mid-term election]? Eight points higher? Five points higher?

On average, they are held 13 months after being picked up for things as minor as joyriding.\n\n\"Immigration officials are authorized to detain certain aliens in the course of immigration proceedings while they determine whether those aliens may be lawfully present in the country,\" the court writes in the first line of the majority opinion, penned by Justice Alito and joined by the court's conservatives in what was a 5-3 opinion.

Immigrant advocates contend that many of these immigrants have a right to be free on bail until their case is heard.\n\nThe lead plaintiff in the case is a legal permanent resident, Alejandro Rodriguez, who came to the U.S. as a child and worked as a dental assistant. As a teenager, he was convicted for joyriding, and at 24, he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance.\n\nRodriguez was detained for three years without the right to appear before a judge to ask for bond.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union took up Rodriguez' case. The civil-rights group filed a class action lawsuit and eventually won his release and the cancellation of his deportation order. Rodriguez remains in the United States.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the immigrant detainees and asylum seekers can't be detained indefinitely and that they have a right to a bond hearing every six months. The appellate court also held that, in order to hold these detainees, the government must show the immigrants would pose a danger or become a flight risk if set free.\n\nThe Obama administration appealed to the high court, insisting that Congress \u2014 not the courts \u2014 has the power to make immigration law and that the law allows the government to detain \"criminal and terrorist aliens\" as well as \"aliens seeking admission to the United States.\"\n\nThe administration also argued that detained immigrants should not be recognized as a class that could bring legal action.

If you don't pick this fight, we might as well not be here. This is a serious one,\" Flake said.\n   He was less confident than most of his Republican colleagues that Trump can be trusted to leave the special counsel alone. \"Just a week ago he said he wasn't firing Tillerson, too.

They arrived as Washington's closest ally, Britain, is locked in a diplomatic struggle with Moscow after accusing the Kremlin of using a nerve agent to poison a former Russian intelligence officer living in the United Kingdom.\n\nTrump also joined the leaders of the U.K., France and Germany on Thursday in issuing a statement that condemned the poisoning attack.\n\nAmong the Russians sanctioned by the U.S. on Thursday are 13 people and three entities, including the Internet Research Agency, indicted by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller for their alleged role in Moscow's influence operation during the 2016 campaign.\n\nTrump has repeatedly questioned whether Russia did indeed interfere in the election, despite the assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies that the Kremlin carried out a sweeping influence operation and propaganda campaign.\n\nLately, however, he has changed his tune and accepted that the active measures took place.

Those two concepts are not mutually exclusive.\"\n\nJones nodded to his own background as a gun-owning hunting enthusiast, and talked about how he's shared that love with his son. He also shied away from completely vilifying the National Rifle Association, which has resisted many of the proposals he and other legislators have put forward. President Trump initially seemed open to more drastic gun control measures in a bipartisan meeting earlier this month, but later backed off and has endorsed arming some school personnel, among other measures backed by the NRA.\n\nBut, Jones argued, ultimately the government's commitment to the safety of its citizens must be paramount. And while he said that some of the actions undertaken recently are positive \u2014 moving to ban bump stocks that can convert guns into automatic-style weapons, efforts to strengthen the background check system \u2014 Jones also said it's not enough. He proposed making background checks universal, including on internet sales, at gun shows and even private sales, as well as implementing three-day waiting periods.\n\n\"So while I know that guns and gun control are difficult issues for this country, I can tell you they're complicated for me, too.

Whether it is for DREAMers, or voting rights, or victims of sex trafficking, or in this case, our children who are demanding action on gun violence, we have the opportunity to build that tidal wave of justice and have hope and history rhyme.\"\n\nBut, Jones said, in order to do so it requires \"courage to seize this moment,\" to work across the aisle and find common ground, tamp down on divisive political rhetoric and be unafraid to do the right thing, no matter the political consequences \u2014 something that rings especially true for Jones, as he faces re-election in 2020 in a deep red state.\n\n\"We could spend days in this chamber debating the meaning and intent of the Second Amendment.

Appointed by President George W. Bush, Mueller took over as director of the FBI one week before the Sept. 11 attacks. After Mueller completed his 10-year term as FBI director, President Obama re-appointed him for a special two-year term, which required a special act of Congress.\n\n\"Bob Mueller is probably about as apolitical and nonpartisan a figure as you could find in Washington, particularly at the levels of government in which he has served,\" Graff says. \"This is someone who really, truly believes in truth, justice [and] in the American way, in a way that very few people in American life today anymore do.\"\n\nWe know him most recently, obviously, as the FBI director, but his tenure in government really dates back to the Reagan years. And he's been appointed or held top jobs in the administrations of all five of the last presidents, and was appointed to the Justice Department, the head of the criminal division, under George H.W. Bush's administration, then was appointed a U.S. attorney by Bill Clinton, then appointed the acting deputy attorney general by George W. Bush, and then later FBI director \u2014 a position he was re-appointed to, in an unprecedented move, by President Obama and confirmed by the U.S. Senate by a vote 100 to 0, a stunningly bipartisan track record in today's times.\n\nPart of what makes Bob Mueller such a fascinating character is he has dedicated his life sort of time and again to public service. ... Mueller and a handful of other colleagues ... [signed] up for Vietnam after college. This was early in the 1960s so it was before Vietnam became the cultural touchpoint that it did later.\n\nSecond Lt. Marine Corps Bob Mueller ended up leading a platoon in the jungles of Vietnam for a year, and really distinguished himself in combat. He received a bronze star with valor for his leadership in an ambush that his unit suffered in the fall of 1968, and then was actually shot himself in a separate incident in April 1969 where he received, of course, the Purple Heart and was quickly back on patrol and served out the remainder of his year.\n\nOn how the FBI changed after the Sept. 11 attacks\n\nBob Mueller, in the days after Sept. 11, sees this incredible sea change in the mission of the FBI, which until then for most of its first 90 years had primarily been a law enforcement agency focused domestically on solving crimes after the fact. And on Sept. 11, we saw an international plot that focused on a suicide attack with catastrophic results, and that that necessitated this top-to-bottom change in the way that the United States approached counterterrorism issues, that after the fact investigation was going to be inadequate in the face of these threats.\n\nSo Mueller was given a mission by [former Attorney General] John Ashcroft and President Bush to not just investigate attacks afterwards, but to stop plots in the first place, to disrupt the attack before it happened.\n\nIt led to this massive reorganization that Bob Mueller spent the next 12 years of his tenure working on, to move the FBI from what was traditionally a domestic law enforcement agency into something that is more akin to an international intelligence agency.\n\nOn how Mueller's investigation into the Trump campaign is similar to other FBI investigations\n\nThis is, in many ways, a perfectly standard and routine FBI investigation. The FBI, as an investigative agency, takes down corrupt organizations, that's what it's designed to do, go after street gangs, drug cartels, organized crime families, and the way that they do that is by starting on the outside and working their way in. And so that can either mean starting at the bottom of an organization, or starting with ancillary charges and working their way inwards, the equivalent of getting Al Capone for tax evasion.\n\nSo you've seen this investigation both where Mueller has started almost literally at the bottom with George Papadopoulos and pressured him to cooperate on people above, and also in the charges against Paul Manafort, which are sort of ancillary to the core question of the behavior of the Trump campaign. He's sort of first charged this decade-long alleged money laundering scheme dating back through some sort of unrelated work, again as a pressure point on Paul Manafort and Rick Gates. ...\n\nWe speak of the Mueller probe as if it is one thing, but it's actually this whole panoply of different investigations into different threads of the Trump campaign, the 2016 presidential election and the involvement of Russia. There's sort of some money-laundering aspects to it, there's some campaign aspects to it, we've seen him go after and get documents from Facebook, other social media sites, Cambridge Analytica, the campaign data team. There's all sorts of different threads of this investigation that are being followed, and we know that Bob Mueller is going to be incredibly tenacious in that investigation but that he's also not going on a fishing expedition.\n\nOn what might happen to the investigation into the Trump campaign if Mueller is fired\n\nThis was an investigation that began before Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel. Remember, actually, the guilty pleas of George Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn both stem from lies that they told to FBI agents months before Robert Mueller stepped into this probe.\n\nAnd so those investigators would presumably continue investigating, and there might even be a new special counsel appointed who steps in, and even if that's not true, and the special counsel's office is disbanded entirely, the prosecution of those open investigations would likely transfer back to the U.S. Attorney's office in D.C. or the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, in Alexandria, Va., and that those investigations might just continue apace absent a special counsel.\n\nPeople forget, or don't know, when you open an FBI investigation that's actually a very formal process that goes through several different stages of an investigation before you end up with what's known as a \"full field\" investigation, and by the time you get there you have to have shown evidence of a potential criminal act in order to get to that formal \"OK\" to continue an investigation.\n\nAnd similarly, there's a formal process to shut down an investigation that requires prosecutors to review the evidence with agents and to decline an investigation and charges. This is not something that's quite as simple as, \"If Bob Mueller is fired, he walks out the door, locks the office behind him and everything just disappears into the ether.\"\n\nSam Briger and Mooj Zadie produced and edited the audio of this interview.

The music got louder. \"I guess my time is up,\" Feinstein conceded as what sounded like a 1940's movie score continued playing.\n\nWithout missing a beat, supporters of her opponent, State Sen. Kevin de Le\u00f3n echoed her statement in a chant: \"Your time is up! Your time is up!,\" a not so subtle reference to Feinstein's 25 years in the U.S. Senate.\n\nIt was a sign of things to come. The grassroots Democratic activists gathered at the party's annual convention in San Diego this weekend implicitly rebuked the state's senior U.S. Senator by denying her the party's endorsement for her re-election bid.\n\nFeinstein finished far behind de Le\u00f3n, the top Democrat in the state Senate. De Le\u00f3n received 54 percent of delegates' votes to just 37 percent for Feinstein. It takes 60 percent to receive an endorsement.\n\nWhile the lack of an endorsement certainly won't keep Feinstein off the ballot, it's a sign that grassroots Democrats are eager to supplant leaders who are seen as too moderate and willing to compromise.\n\nDemocratic Party activists have never really been Feinstein's people. In 1990, when she was running for governor, she came to the party convention and expressed her support for the death penalty, eliciting boos from the liberal crowd. She lost the party endorsement to her opponent John Van de Kamp but got the nomination anyway, ultimately losing the November election to Pete Wilson.\n\nFeinstein has always been a little to the right of where the party's activists are. Now, at age 84 and in her final campaign, Feinstein is once again at odds with progressives, despite her efforts to move left by more strongly opposing President Donald Trump's agenda.\n\nShe said the Senate appropriations committee she sits on would never approve $25 billion for Trump's wall along the Mexico boarder. But minutes later, de Le\u00f3n's team sent texts noting that Feinstein had just voted for exactly that as part of the \"Common Sense Coalition\" immigration plan that failed to get through the Senate.\n\nThe bill would have provided a path to citizenship for so-called Dreamers, but it also included $25 billion for the wall.\n\nFeinstein also reminded the crowd of her longstanding leadership on gun control, including her success against long odds at getting an assault weapons ban signed into law in 1994.\n\nIn his speech to the convention, de Le\u00f3n reminded the crowd that his opponent hasn't always been a reliable liberal. \"Democrats, you'll never have to guess where I stand,\" de Le\u00f3n said before noting he's championed issues such as raising the minimum wage, single-payer health care and the environment.\n\n\"Moral clarity is always doing the right thing when no one is watching,\" he said. \"And it should never take a primary challenge to stand up for California values.\"\n\nAs leader of the state Senate, De Le\u00f3n has had his own problems of late, most notably criticism of his slow response to the sexual harassment scandal in Sacramento.

The prosecutor who replaced Cox built on that work, ultimately leading to Nixon's resignation.\n \nGormley said the current special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, is operating in that same mold.\n \nBut at the White House, President Trump and his lawyers have been pressing the Mueller team to move even faster. So is another familiar figure: former Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr.\n \n\"The American people, I think, want to know, was there collusion,\" Starr told CNN last week. \"Let's get that answered. That would be my sense, if I were at the Justice Department.\"\n \nStarr, of course, spent five years and more than $40 million investigating President Bill Clinton. Critics say Starr took too long and wandered away from his original mission. He was far from the only independent counsel to come under attack as a \"roving Frankenstein monster,\" Gormley said.\n \nIn the category of \"no end,\" there was the investigation of Clinton's secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Henry Cisneros. In 1995, then-Attorney General Janet Reno asked for an independent counsel to determine whether Cisneros should face prosecution for providing false information about payments to a former mistress.\n \n\"I'm disappointed by that outcome but I'm hopeful that the investigation will be completed expeditiously,\" Cisneros told reporters at the time.\n \nBut any hope Cisneros had for a speedy resolution went bust. The independent counsel in his case, David Barrett, kept working even after the law authorizing his work expired.

He paid smugglers to take him across North Africa and to Europe, but when they reached Libya, he and other migrants were detained by a Libyan militia. \n   \"My mistake was that I came to this country [Libya],\" he says. \n   There began a three-year ordeal that saw him thrown into prison, held for ransom, and bought and sold into bonded labor or debt slavery. \n   Mohammed is now 20.

He's long been familiar with the mistreatment of migrants by human traffickers, smugglers and militias in Libya. \n   Libya still reels from its civil war in 2011. Rival governments in the east and the west wrestle for power, and militias run the streets. \n   But since mid-2016, Slim says, more and more migrants have arrived bringing testimony of being traded as commodities and being sold into slavery. \"At first, I was a bit skeptical. If just one person comes with this story, of course you are not sure if it's truth. But then when so many people came and told us the same thing, it became more clear,\" Slim says. \n   Late last year, a CNN investigation revealed footage of what appears to be African migrants being auctioned off. In the video, an auctioneer sells men he describes as \"big strong boys\" to the highest bidder. \n   The footage caused international outrage. In December, the United Nations Security Council condemned the reported acts of slavery in Libya as \"heinous abuses\" and called \"for those responsible to be held to account.\" \n   In southern Tunisia, Slim says he started hearing accounts of slavery long before they came to light in international media. \n   Most of the men and women at the Red Crescent shelter come from African countries. Slim introduced NPR to migrants from Gambia, Nigeria and Senegal. They sleep on foam mattresses on a concrete floor, several to a room. \n   Five young men want to discuss their experiences. They didn't witness the secret slave auctions reported by CNN, although they say they have heard of those. Instead, they describe Libya's detention centers \u2014 a network of prisons, some of them sanctioned by the state as part of an effort to combat illegal immigration \u2014 as being the very places where migrants are \"bought\" and \"sold.\" \n   Boubaker Nassou, a 30-year-old from Gambia, describes the detention center where he was held as a \"slave market\" and as the \"prison where they sell people.\" \n   Like Mohammed, from Niger, the smugglers' car that Nassou rode in was detained by a militia once he crossed into Libya. The migrants were bundled into another vehicle, and he says they were taken \"straight to the prison where they sell people.\" \n   It was a large, dank room, crammed full of African men and women. Nassou says he barely had space to sit or lie on the concrete floor. It was hot and no one was allowed to shower; the air was putrid. \n   And all the while, Nassou says, Libyans would come to haggle with the guards. What they were haggling over was the price for prisoners. He says a \"business\" has developed of buying migrants out of one detention center and selling them to another for profit. \n   \n            \n\n    \n        \n            \n                Boubaker Nassou describes the prisons where he was held in Libya as \"slave markets.\" He was repeatedly bought and sold into and out of these prisons before being taken into bonded labour.

'This one is 500.' 'This one is for 300' and 'this one is for 200.' They sell you and buy you like that,\" Nassou said. (In U.S. dollars, that's a range of about $150 to $350.) \n   Shortly after he was detained and thrown in detention, in 2016, Nassou says he was bought by a Libyan man for 500 Libyan dinars \u2014 the equivalent of $350. \n   He doesn't know the man's name; in the prison, he says he was taught to just refer to every Libyan he met as mudir, Arabic for \"boss.\" \n   He says the man moved him to another detention center, and sold him to the guards for three times the price. \n   These accounts are consistent with some of the reporting by humanitarian and rights organizations on the mistreatment of migrants in Libyan detention centers. \n   A report by the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration in 2017 also documented what it called \"slave market conditions\" for migrants in Libya. The report included testimony similar to Nassou's, of migrants being bought and sold for profit between militias and detention centers. \n   An Amnesty International report published in December estimates there are over 20,000 refugees and migrants currently being held in official detention centers that are \u2014 in theory \u2014 run by the Libyan Interior Ministry's Department of Combating Illegal Migration. \n   \"There are 33 official detention centers under the DCIM,\" said Marwa Mohamed, a researcher for the Amnesty International report, using the department's acronym. \"But the DCIM has nominal control over them. They are in fact run by militias in certain areas and there's very little oversight.\" \n   Thousands more migrants are being held in places run by criminal gangs, separate from the government based in the capital Tripoli. But, Mohamed says, human rights abuses are happening in both types of places. \n   Libyan law has few provisions for asylum-seekers or protections for victims of human trafficking. It criminalizes irregular entry and punishes undocumented immigrants with fines or jail while they wait to be deported. \n   The Amnesty International report, which is based on interviews with dozens of migrants, says that prison guards extort the inmates and demand ransom from their relatives. In some cases, guards will torture a prisoner so that their loved one can hear their screams on the phone. \n   When they can't extract payment, the report says, there are cases where the prisoners are sold into bonded labor, a form of modern slavery. Someone will come and pay the prison to free an inmate, but from that moment the prisoner is beholden to the person who paid for their release. Often they are forced to work off the debt. \n   \"Everyone who gets out of these detention centers has either somehow miraculously escaped, has been sold, or has to pay a fee \u2014 a large ransom \u2014 in order to get out. These are your options,\" the researcher Mohamed says. \n   An official in the Tripoli government declined NPR's request to comment on the treatment of migrants in Libya. \n   Libyan authorities have called for investigations into the sale of migrants. And in recent months the immigration department that oversees the detention centers has taken steps to close down centers where abuses happen, according to Amnesty International. \n   Nonetheless, migrants say the abuse \u2014 and selling \u2014 of migrants in Libya remains prevalent. \n   In its report, Amnesty also accused Europe of continuing to \"outsource border control to Libya\" despite the horrors suffered by migrants there. \n   Several migrants in the Tunisian shelter describe experiences of being sold into bonded labor in Libya. \n   \n            \n\n    \n        \n            \n                Boubacker Nassou (third from left) lives in a shelter run by the Tunisian Red Crescent aid group that houses men who fled from Libya. Many tell stories of being forced into modern day slavery in Libya.\n                \n                \n                    \n                    Ruth Sherlock/NPR\n                    \n                \n                hide caption\n            \n\n        \n\n\n\n            toggle caption\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n        Ruth Sherlock/NPR\n        \n    \n\n\n   \n\n   Some of the accounts are cruelly bizarre \u2014 a young man says he was dressed up as a woman by his Libyan owner who then tried to sell him to a sex trafficker. \n   Nassou says in 2016 he was sold out of a detention center in the northwestern coastal town of Zawiya to a Libyan who needed a \"painter man.\" The man who bought him took him back to his house and made him paint all the rooms, the Gambian migrant says. \n   Nassou says his buyer seemed to take pity on him and let him go after his work was done. \n   Others are not so fortunate. Mohammed, from Niger, says the Libyan who bought him from a prison was in fact paying his ransom that had been set for him by guards. \"He paid the amount of money, which means, he had bought a slave,\" he said. \n   But Mohammed says, there was no contract, no promise of how long he'd have to work before he could have his freedom. \n   \"If you're not Libyan they don't think you're human. You're an animal in their eyes,\" he says, rage flashing across his face. \n   Sometimes the farmer would give him food, sometimes he wouldn't, says Mohammed. The way he was treated depended a lot on the farmer's mood. \"You know, sometimes, he would [be] happy and sometimes he would be sad,\" Mohammed says. \"When he was happy, he would share his happiness with me.\" \n   \"And when he was down...\" his voice trails off. He later describes being beaten, and given only scraps of food to eat. \n   One time, he says, he built up the courage to ask the farmer for payment for his work. \"I asked how he was OK with not giving me what was rightfully mine,\" he says. The farmer's answer was to pull out a gun and shoot, narrowly missing him. \n   Mohammed slept in the dirt outside the farmer's home. The farm was set in a remote scrubland far from any other settlements. But at night he could make out headlights twinkling faintly in the distance. \n   \"They were far away but you could see them,\" he says. One night after seven months of captivity, Mohammed says he had enough. \"I got fed up with the hunger and the exhaustion and the beatings and the sickness. I didn't have a watch, but it must have been around 2 to 2:30 in the morning. Everyone was asleep. I ran.\" He sprinted for three hours to reach the road he'd seen from so far away and hitched a lift to the capital Tripoli. \n   Eventually Mohammed managed to earn enough money from odd jobs to pay smugglers to escape the country. He boarded a small, overcrowded boat that broke down in the Mediterranean Sea. He was rescued by the Libyan coast guard, which brought him to Slim from the Red Crescent. \n   Slim says he tries to help the migrants as he can. He found Mohammed a job as an olive picker in a grove not far from Zarzis, a town on Tunisia's southeastern coast. \n   He's still extremely poor. He sleeps on a foam mattress in a tiny, dark and empty concrete room. But in comparison to what he's been through in Libya, he says, abject poverty is a small problem: \"Here the work is little, and the money is bad. But at least there's safety, and that's what I want \u2014 to live my life in a safe place.\" \n   Ruth Sherlock and Lama al-Arian reported in Zarzis, Tunisia.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kelsey Snell", "body": "From left, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisc.,, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif. appear for a Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony honoring the Office of Strategic Services in the Capitol on March 21, 2018.

Negotiators also reached a deal to repair existing fencing while explicitly protecting the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge in Texas.\n   \n   \n\n   The bill also includes nearly $700 million for election security, including additional money for the FBI to conduct counter-intelligence to fight Russian cyber attacks. States would benefit from an infusion of money for election technology grants to keep elections systems safe.\n   Negotiators included several bipartisan items, like $2.8 billion to battle opioid addiction as well as major funding increases for the Department of Veterans Affairs, federal highway projects and high-speed broadband development.\n   But what isn't included is nearly as significant as what made it in the bill.\n   The spending measure is widely expected to be one of the last must-pass bills to come up for a vote this year, meaning immigration has few opportunities for consideration in the coming months.\n   Looming midterm election and the reality that the political season will soon overtake any ability to advance any major legislation before Election Day.\n   \n   \n\n   Democrats remain frustrated that the bill does not deal with immigration.

Today's case could affect a lot more people.\n\nBack in 2006, Lozman was not exactly a welcome sight for the Riviera Beach City Council. He had managed to scuttle their plans to convert the local public marina into a private one.\n\nA transcript of a closed-door meeting in June of that year shows council members discussing tactics for dealing with Lozman, including the possibility of hiring a private investigator to turn the tables on the city's critic.\n\n\"I think it would help to intimidate,\" Council Chairperson Elizabeth Wade said, adding, \"I think they should be questioned by some of our people ... so they can feel the same kind of unwarranted heat.\"\n\nOn Nov. 15, 2006, the dispute between Lozman and the city council boiled over. During the public comment portion of an open meeting, Lozman decided to speak up.\n\n\"They were not in a very good mood,\" he recalls. \"They realized they had to abandon their entire redevelopment plan. ... They were throwing in the towel that night, and that's when I got up to make my public comment, and the chairperson was just livid looking at me.\"\n\nLozman started out, \"You're probably aware that the U.S. Attorney's office has arrested the second corrupt local politician. This time it was former Palm Beach County Commissioner Tony Masilotti.\"\n\nChairperson Wade immediately interrupted him. \"Fane Lozman, you have the right to say what you want to say publicly, but you will not stand up and go through that.\"\n\nLozman stuck to his guns, insisting that he had the right to speak. Wade summoned the police officer on duty to the podium and told Lozman to leave or be arrested.\n\nWhen Lozman refused to leave, Wade told the officer to \"carry him out.\"\n\nThe officer handcuffed Lozman at the podium and took him to a holding cell at the local police department, charging him with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.\n\nA video of the whole episode can be viewed on YouTube:\n\nThe charges were subsequently dropped, but Lozman continued to fume. He sued the city, alleging a number of retaliatory acts, including his arrest at the council meeting.\n\nA jury, though, sided with the city.\n\nA federal appeals court upheld the verdict, concluding there was probable cause to believe that Lozman was violating or was about to violate a Florida law that makes it a second-degree misdemeanor to disturb a lawful assembly.\n\nLozman hotly disputes that characterization of his conduct.\n\n\"I did maintain order,\" he said. \"Disorderly conduct relative to a public meeting is if you go beyond your 3 minutes, if you use profanity, if you're screaming or yelling. I was doing none of those.\"\n\nHe maintains instead that what the council chairperson objected to was the content of his speech.\n\n\"If she didn't want to listen to that content, she shouldn't run for public office,\" he said, \"because the First Amendment protects comments that are critical and maybe comments people don't like to hear.\"\n\nLozman added that this Supreme Court case is far more important than his last one.\n\n\"If I lose, then police and municipalities and the final policymakers who run the city, they're immunized,\" Lozman said. \"They can just come up with any bogus misdemeanor arrest to remove you from making your public comments.\"\n\nAs the briefs in the case indicate, Lozman's experience is hardly unique.\n\nIndeed, more than two dozen media organizations have filed a brief pointing to similar problems encountered by reporters and photographers engaged in everything from investigative journalism to covering demonstrations.\n\nWhile arresting journalists for critical coverage may be the hallmark of repressive regimes, and rarely happen in the United States, the brief observes, \"It does happen.\"\n\nThe brief, points, for instance, to Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio's arrest of the publishers of the Phoenix New Times for publishing articles that probed the sheriff's commercial real-estate holdings.\n\nThe City of Riviera Beach declined NPR's request to discuss its case, but in written briefs filed with the court, the city council, backed by the Trump administration, contends that the police officer was justified in arresting Lozman, even if Lozman's speech was perfectly legal.\n\nThe city argues that in the context of law enforcement, an open-ended right to sue for false arrest would be chaotic, expensive for municipalities and dangerous.\n\nConsider this example, the city argues: a police officer sees someone illegally driving a van through the parking lot of a federal building with a sign that says, \"Remember the Children of Waco.\"\n\nThe police officer might reasonably decide to arrest the driver, rather than just issue a citation, thus buying time to determine whether the driver is a concerned citizen or another Oklahoma City bomber.\n\nLozman's lawyers, in their briefs, counter that the defendant here isn't the individual policeman, it's the city. The arrest did not occur in the field, but occurred while Lozman was \"calmly speaking during the public comment portion of a city council meeting,\" and that what he said \"provided no basis for the arrest.\"\n\nA decision in the case is expected by summer.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kelsey Snell", "body": "Lawmakers went to the White House Wednesday looking for guidance from President Trump on gun legislation. Instead, they left the televised round table with vague instructions to meet a set of contradictory policy positions laid out by Trump.\n\nThat meeting followed a familiar pattern for many lawmakers who are trying to write and pass legislation that can meet Trump's shifting approval. Even many Republicans responded to the White House meeting with confusion and frustration over the lack of clear guidance from the president.\n\nOver the course of the hour-long broadcast Trump seemed to embrace plans to expand background checks and increase age limits for purchasing long gun rifles, positions that generally anathema to congressional Republicans. He also suggested preemptively taking guns away from potentially dangerous people, a policy that might draw significant legal challenges.\n\nTrump also conceded, repeatedly, that it's hard to pass any legislation in Congress, let alone laws to curb gun rights. But many lawmakers, including some Republicans, say Trump's own statements make the already difficult task of passing gun legislation even harder.\n\nThe meeting concluded with Trump asking lawmakers to go back and talk about the extensive list of proposals floated at the meeting, and without a White House endorsement of any specific plan.\n\nPennsylvania Republican Rep. Ryan Costello told NPR's Morning Edition that he worries that kind of broad directive makes it harder for Congress to focus their attention on specific legislation that could pass and eventually become law.\n\n\"There's still an element of unpredictability on what the White House is willing to lean on from a gun safety reform measure,\" Costello said. \"There was a bit of contradiction in what he said.\"\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, is one of the leading lawmakers working on a proposal to update the criminal background check system, shared similar concerns Wednesday after the meeting adjourned. Cornyn told reporters that it is his experience that passing these measures is harder than it sounds.\n\n\"I think everybody is trying to absorb what we just heard,\" Cornyn said. \"He's a unique president and I think if he was focused on a specific piece of legislation rather than a grab bag of ideas then I think he could have a lot of influence, but right now we don't have that.\"", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Scott Detrow", "body": "Pennsylvania Special Election: Down To The Wire In Trump Country\n\nTuesday's special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District is coming down to the wire, with Republican Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb battling for a seat deep in Trump Country.\n\nPresident Trump won this Pittsburgh-area district by about 20 points in 2016, but it's Lamb who has run a high-energy race to challenge Saccone, after Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Penn., resigned last year amid a sex scandal. Republicans have privately grumbled that their candidate has been lackluster, and the Democrat could be poised to pull off the upset. Polls will close at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nIf Lamb is victorious, it would be the highest-profile warning yet against the GOP ahead of this November's midterm elections. Not only will Democrats have finally flipped a GOP House seat in a special election, but the win would come in a solidly red area and underscore just how little help Trump might provide the party this fall. And that could trigger even more GOP legislators to head for the exits, adding to an already record number of House Republican incumbents retiring.\n\nTrump visited the district for a rally on Saturday as a last-ditch rescue mission, where he asked his supporters, \"Do me a favor. Get out on Tuesday and vote for Rick Saccone.\" Trump also referred to the Democrat as \"Lamb the sham,\" saying that if elected, Lamb would vote as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wants, even though the candidate said he would not support keeping her as leader of the Democratic caucus.\n\nThe president's visit capped off a massive effort by GOP groups to keep the seat in Republican hands. More than $10 million has been spent to support Saccone, about twice as much as has been spent for Lamb. That massive expenditure is despite the fact that the district won't even exist in its current form come November due to court-ordered redistricting, underscoring just how desperate Republicans are to avoid an embarrassing loss that would portend a growing blue wave.\n\nIt would also show that the GOP's economic argument to voters and touting their tax cuts may not be enough to save them at the ballot box, either. While early ads focused on a fiscal message, closing arguments from Republican outside groups hit Lamb on immigration and crime instead.\n\nLamb had outside support in the final days from former Vice President Joe Biden, a Pennsylvania native. The young former prosecutor and Marine veteran has honed in on local issues and eschewed most national help, and even Republicans concede he's been an unusually tough candidate.\n\nIf Saccone wins, President Trump would get credit for juicing Republican turnout in the final days.\n\nData in the last week of the race backed up assertions from the district that Saccone's fundraising was weak. Of the more than $10 million spent to support his campaign, less than 10 percent was from the Saccone campaign itself. On the Democratic side, about two-thirds of the money spent to support Lamb came from his campaign.\n\nOne byproduct of all that money and the television ads that have blanketed the Pittsburgh media market in recent weeks is a lot of confused voters. Pittsburgh public radio station WESA is reporting that election officials in Allegheny County have fielded calls all day from angry would-be voters wanting to know why their polling place was closed. The answer: These people didn't live in the 18th congressional district.\n\nIn Virginia and in special state-level races around the country over the past year, suburban voters motivated by anti-Trump sentiments have shown up in droves to vote for Democrats. One key question is whether or not that happens again tonight.\n\nRepublican operatives are particularly interested in the early results from Upper St. Clair, a high-income, high-education Pittsburgh suburb that traditionally votes Republican. \"If Lamb wins there, it's over,\" said one longtime Pittsburgh GOP strategist. Bethel Park is another high-income suburb to track for similar trends.\n\nWith a strong push from unions like the AFL-CIO and the United Mine Workers of America, Lamb is also attempting to cut into the wide margins that Republican congressional candidates typically rack up in the district's rural corners, too. Greene County, in the southern end of the 18th, broke for Trump by 40 points in 2016, but Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald told NPR that recent polls showed the two candidates neck-and-neck. If counties like Greene and Washington are near-even, then Lamb would have a clear shot to win.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jessica Taylor", "body": "Trump Backs Conflicting Gun Measures While Negotiating With Lawmakers On TV\n\nIn a freewheeling meeting with lawmakers on efforts to curtail gun violence, President Trump appeared to throw his support behind a number of conflicting measures, including some that are opposed by the powerful gun lobby.\n\nDuring the gathering at the White House of both GOP and Democratic lawmakers, the president showed an openness to expanding background checks, possibly raising the age to purchase AR-15 rifles and also overriding due process, if necessary, in order to take guns away from mentally ill people or those who had been red-flagged as potential dangers, as the admitted shooter in Parkland, Fla., two weeks ago had been.\n\nTrump bluntly told GOP lawmakers that any effort to include a concealed carry reciprocity measure with a gun bill would effective sink its changes \u2014 which is due to firm opposition from Senate Democrats. But there were other moments where the president showed a naivite of the lawmaking process, suggesting that it would be easy to get 60 votes for a bill to pass the Senate, suggesting merging some incompatible ideas and chiding lawmakers for being too beholden to the National Rifle Association \u2014 a group from which he's enjoyed broad support and remains particularly chummy with its leaders.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, told reporters the White House meeting did little to advance the debate in Congress over legislation aimed at curbing gun violence. \"It's still unclear to me what can actually pass, and my experience is these things are harder to do than they sound. So I think we'll sleep on it and see where we are tomorrow,\" he said.\n\nThe president repeatedly challenged long-standing GOP orthodoxy on gun policy in today's meeting, leaving legislators bewildered by what happens next and what, precisely, Trump actually supports.\n\n\"I think everybody is trying to absorb what we just heard,\" Cornyn said. \"He's a unique president and I think if he was focused on a specific piece of legislation rather than a grab bag of ideas than I think he could have a lot of influence, but right now we don't have that.\"\n\nTrump underscored that he wants a bill that will address many issues he believes has contributed to mass shootings over the past few decades, ranging from background check loopholes to mental health legislation.\n\n\"We can really get there but we have to do it,\" Trump said at the outset of the meeting.\n\nThere are two major bipartisan bills the president seized upon, and even suggested that they could be merged. First, he voiced support the effort by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., which failed in 2013 in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, that would have expanded background checks.\n\nTrump expressed disbelief that such a bill didn't pass after such a devastating attack that killed 20 young children and six adults. And chided that one reason it failed was because then-President Obama didn't sufficiently support it \u2014 despite the fact that the Democrat spent considerable time and political capital to back its passage, calling it \"a pretty shameful day for Washington\" when it fell just six votes short of the 60 votes needed to advance in the Senate.\n\nTrump asked what the bill did to address raising the age from 18 to 21 for some firearm purchases like AR-15s which have been used in several deadly shootings. Toomey responded that it didn't currently address it, to which Trump retorted that it was because \"you're afraid of the NRA.\"\n\nThe second bill Trump signaled his support for is the \"Fix NICS\" bill proposed by Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Chris Murphy, D-Conn., which would improve reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System which they hope will flag people who shouldn't be able to purchase guns.\n\nMurphy, who has been a leading voice for gun control especially after the 2012 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn., complained that they haven't been able to get anywhere significant in the past few years because \"the gun lobby has a veto power.\"\n\n\"If all we end up doing is the stuff that the gun industry supports, then this just isn't worth it,\" the Connecticut Democrat said.\n\nHe also argued that implementing universal background checks was critical, citing statistics that gun murders in states with such checks have dropped by over one-third. Currently, background checks at gun shows and on internet sales aren't federally mandated. The NRA has opposed such an expansion.\n\nLater on, Trump again posited he would be willing to buck the NRA if necessary \u2014 despite the fact he's repeatedly assured the lobbying group he's a loyal ally, had lunch over the weekend with the group's leaders and said earlier in the meeting that he's a \"big fan\" of the group.\n\n\"They have great power over you people. They have less power over me,\" Trump said, latter adding that, \"Some of you people are petrified of the NRA. You can't be petrified.\"\n\n\"Take the gun first, go through due process second\"\n\nOne of the more surprising stances Trump took appeared to flaunt due process for gun owners \u2014 and one that is sure to enrage the NRA.\n\nAfter Vice President Pence began to talk about how he and the president had conversations with governors earlier this week, Trump interjected that people should \"take the firearms first and then go to court\" if there is a concern about someone having a gun and potentially being unstable or likely to commit violence.\n\n\"A lot of times by the time you go to court, it takes so long to go to court to get the due process procedures, I like taking the guns early,\" Trump continued.\n\nThe president cited multiple warnings that lawmakers had about the Parkland shooter that went ignored by law enforcement.\n\n\"Take the gun first, go through due process second,\" Trump said.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a frequent critic of the president, was not amused by such a suggestion.\n\n\"Strong leaders don't automatically agree with the last thing that was said to them. We have the Second Amendment and due process of law for a reason,\" Sasse said in a statement after the meeting. \"We're not ditching any Constitutional protections simply because the last person the President talked to today doesn't like them.\"\n\nAt last week's Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump warned the crowd that it was Democrats who would \"take away your Second Amendment...which we will never allow that.\"\n\nTrump did reiterate his support for one measure the NRA has heavily backed \u2014 arming some teachers and school personnel, ending gun-free school zones as a way to solidify school security.\n\n\"You've got to have defense too,\" the president said in his opening remarks. \"You can't just be sitting ducks, and that's exactly what we've allowed people in these buildings to be.\"\n\n\"They're not going to come in when they know they're going to come out dead,\" Trump later added, though he did seem to suggest it could be an issue left up to individual states.\n\nSome lawmakers, such as Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., Rep. John Rutherford, R-Fla., and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., who was critically shot last June during a congressional baseball practice, spoke out in support of such a proposal. Others, including Rep. Ted Deutsch, D-Fla., who represents Parkland, said he and many others oppose such measures.\n\nWill any of this matter?\n\nWhile the meeting did show that there could be some consensus reached on these issues, Trump has often thrown his support behind measures, only to see those endorsements walked back later by White House staff or contradicted by the president himself. That's on top of the fact that the president often appears highly influenced by the last person he talked to about an issue. So anything Trump appeared to get behind or suggest at the meeting should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nA similar bipartisan meeting in early January on efforts to field a comprehensive immigration bill which would address the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. In that meeting, Trump suggested he would sign any bill lawmakers sent him and that he would take any heat and expected backlash from the anti-immigration wing, which has been a major bloc of support for the president.\n\nBut later Trump insisted that any bill contain not only funding for his border wall but cuts to legal immigration, which was a non-starter with Democrats and even some Republicans. Ultimately, many proposals failed earlier this month in the Senate.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. \u2014 a sometimes critic, sometimes ally of Trump \u2014 expressed some skepticism after the meeting and also issued a warning.\n\n\"If the president has another one of these sessions and he doesn't follow through \u2014 it's going to hurt him. It's going to hurt the Republican Party,\" Graham told CNN. \"I've seen this movie before. If it ends up like immigration he's done himself a lot of harm.\"\n\nCornyn also said many of Trump's comments would not sway the debate. \"I wouldn't confuse what he said with what can actually pass. I don't expect to see any great divergence in terms of people's views on the Second Amendment, for example.\"\n\nCornyn is still supporting his incremental, bipartisan bill co-authored with Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., to improve the current background check system, but without broad agreement in the Senate, the legislation could easily get bogged down in more controversial gun debates. \"It's pretty clear to me that we're not going to get that consent agreement so that means [Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell] is going to have to make a decision on how to proceed and how much floor time he's willing to commit to this,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the week Cornyn has expressed hope that Congress could act on the bill this week, but he said today it is clear that will not happen. Like many lawmakers, he was candid that this gun debate may again yield no tangible legislative results. \"I think the deadline is going to be the next mass shooting. It's only a matter of time, and if we don't do something I think there's going to be a heavy price to pay,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"I don't want to meet another family who lost a loved one in a mass shooting and think we could have done something which would have prevented this, but we didn't do it because we didn't act.\"", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "", "body": "In Texas, Democratic Rep.

Democratic Congressman Beto O'Rourke of El Paso is hoping to change that, though. He won his party's primary for U.S. Senate yesterday. And he will now face incumbent Ted Cruz, who is already taking aim at O'Rourke. The Cruz campaign released a new statewide radio ad last night.\n\n    (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"IF YOU'RE GONNA RUN IN TEXAS\")\n\n    UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) Beto wants those open borders and wants to take our guns. Not a chance on earth he'll get a vote from millions of Texans. If you're going to run in Texas...\n\n    MARTIN: We are joined now by Congressman Beto O'Rourke. Thanks so much for being with us, Congressman.\n\n    BETO O'ROURKE: Good morning.\n\n    MARTIN: There's a smile in my voice because that song is a doozy. Do you plan to retaliate in kind with a similar jingle?\n\n    O'ROURKE: No. No. We're going to stay focused on the big things. You know, folks that I'm listening to across Texas, now having visited 226 counties, want to make sure that we're leading on the issues that they care most about. They want to make sure that everyone can afford to see a doctor or fill their prescriptions. We had a woman who died in Weatherford, Texas, last year of the flu - schoolteacher. Shouldn't be happening in 2018. They want this state, the defining immigrant state, to lead the way, not just in stopping a wall that we don't need but writing immigration laws in our own image that reflect our values and help us to make the most of everyone in our communities.\n\n    MARTIN: So let me ask you. You had, by far, the most name recognition in the Democratic primary yesterday. You only took home just over 60 percent of that vote. So if you can't get Democrats to unite behind you, how are you going to get the majority of Texans to do so?\n\n    O'ROURKE: You know, we've spent the last year making sure that we listen to and are with everyone that we want to represent and serve in Texas. So that means we're going to places like Archer City, that hasn't seen a U.S. Senate candidate in 70 years, since LBJ last campaigned there in 1948; means we're going to Lufkin; means we're going to Pecos County and Amarillo - not the usual places that you see a Democrat. But I want to represent and fight for all 28 million Texans. It doesn't matter to me whether they're Republicans or independents or nonvoters.\n\n    The idea is to be with them, listen to them and make sure that their issues and their fights are our issues and our fights. And so we've got another eight months in which to meet and listen to those that we want to serve and represent. It's a long, maybe frustrating strategy for some. But I think it's the right way to run a race in Texas and perhaps the only way to win.\n\n    MARTIN: Well, let me ask you on the issues. I've spoken to several voters here this week. One man, who says that he usually votes for Democrats - he told me he likes you, but if you support an assault weapons ban, that it would be a deal breaker for him. Do you think you can win in Texas by supporting a gun control measure like that?\n\n    O'ROURKE: I do. I think - when I listened to someone in Brownwood, a woman who says that she was born and raised on a ranch with a .22 in her hands, as she told me. But she also has 46 grandkids. And her No. 1 question to me was, can I trust you to stand up to the NRA? She can be forgiven for asking that because Ted Cruz has taken more than $300,000 from the NRA just in 2016 alone. So folks don't know whether he represents the NRA or Texans.\n\n    I haven't taken a dime from the NRA or any special interest group, corporation or PAC. I'm going to stand up for Texans. And Texans are asking me to make sure that we have universal background checks, that we don't sell weapons of war whose only purpose is to kill people as effectively and efficiently and in as great a number as possible. I want to make sure that their kids, their grandkids - that they are safe in their schools, in their churches, in their communities.\n\n    So I think that's the right thing to do. And I think Texas with a proud tradition of gun ownership and gun safety can lead the way on this issue.\n\n    MARTIN: But you just mentioned you've been crisscrossing the state on road trips, going to places that have never seen Democrats even be competitive. You still only got just 60 percent of the Democratic primary. Does that indicate the kind of support that will win statewide?\n\n    O'ROURKE: I think it indicates that we have a 24-month campaign strategy and a massive state, 254 counties - largest of the lower 48. So it's going to take a lot of time to listen...\n\n    MARTIN: Yeah.\n\n    O'ROURKE: ...To everyone and work with everyone. And I think you just need to watch us over the next eight months. And the...\n\n    MARTIN: We will...\n\n    O'ROURKE: ...Test will be on November 6.\n\n    MARTIN: Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke, thanks your time.\n\n    O'ROURKE: Thank you.\n\n\n    Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

He's also endorsing legislation to improve background checks, and urging states to pass laws temporarily keeping guns out of the hands of people judged to be dangerous to themselves or others.\n   A policy proposal unveiled Sunday evening has Trump renewing his support for arming teachers and other school employees on a volunteer basis. He stopped short of endorsing a higher age limit for would-be gun buyers.\n   Last week, Florida's legislature raised the age limit for buying long guns in that state from 18 to 21. The measure drew an immediate legal challenge from the National Rifle Association.\n   Nikolas Cruz, the gunman accused of killing 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, is 19 years old.\n   Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who will chair the new commission, praised students at the school for making safety a top priority for policymakers.\n   \"There's been a lot of talk in the past but very little action,\" DeVos said in a conference call with reporters. \"I have to give credit to the students in their courage and consistent call for action.\"\n   \n    \n\n    \n\n   The agenda outlined by the White House falls short of what many of the students have been calling for. And it leaves much of the heavy lifting to states. The president is not planning a speech or other public event to promote his plan.\n   Trump endorsed a bill sponsored by Sens. John Cornyn, R-Tex., and Chris Murphy, D-Conn., that's designed to improve the database used to check the backgrounds of would-be gun buyers. But he did not endorse a separate proposal from Sens. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Joe Manchin, D-WV, that would extend background checks to gun purchases made online and at gun shows.\n   The president will encourage states to authorize \"risk protection orders,\" which allow law enforcement to temporarily seize guns from people whom a court has determined to be dangerous. Such orders currently are allowed in only a handful of states. Florida joined their ranks last week.\n   Trump's agenda is generally consistent with policy positions of the NRA, which supports arming teachers and other school staffers, as well as improved background checks. Although the president initially supported a higher age limit for gun purchases, the White House left that out of its recommendation to states. The NRA opposes higher age limits. Administration officials say the president's commission will explore the idea.\n   On Saturday, Trump appeared to mock the idea of federal commissions \u2014 a trusty standby for politicians who want to give the appearance of action without the risk of actually doing anything.\n   \"We can't just keep setting up blue ribbon committees with your wife and your wife and your husband, and they meet and they have a meal and they talk,\" Trump told a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. \n   Although the school safety commission has no timetable to produce recommendations, DeVos insists it's not simply a stalling tactic.\n   \"There's no time to waste,\" DeVos said. \"No student, no family, no teacher, and no school should have to live the horror of Parkland, or Sandy Hook or Columbine again.\"", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jessica Taylor", "body": "Citing his ailing health, Sen.

Federal authorities said that evades common sense and has the potential to endanger communities in California and beyond.\n\nThe new federal case represents an escalation of the long-running battle between the Trump administration and California, whose Democratic governor, Jerry Brown, and attorney general, Xavier Becerra, have positioned themselves as ideological opponents to the White House on matters from immigration and climate change to criminal justice.\n\nLast year, California lawmakers passed three immigration-related laws that feature prominently in the new lawsuit. One bars private employers from voluntarily cooperating with federal immigration officials and requires businesses to notify workers in advance of a federal raid.\n\nA second law restricts state and local law enforcement from voluntarily sharing information with the feds about the release dates of undocumented people in their custody. That law also bars the transfer of undocumented people into federal custody. The third law under federal challenge covers state inspections of detention facilities that hold noncitizens in federal custody.\n\nThe Justice Department is asking for a preliminary injunction to block those three laws. To advance their cause, federal lawyers cite a 2012 Supreme Court dispute, in which the Obama administration sued Arizona over its punitive law meant to crack down on immigrants there.\n\nA divided Supreme Court eventually ruled parts of the state law were \"pre-empted\" under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.

In addition to ending new shipments to the island, the agency said it would turn the food and water that remained over to the Puerto Rican government, which would distribute them until stocks ran out.\n\nSpeaking on the Senate floor, Florida Democratic Sen.

An agency spokeswoman wrote that \"FEMA will continue to provide commodities to the State [Puerto Rico] until January 31st.\" She also wrote that the agency's food and water mission would \"officially shut off\" on that date.\n\nBut as public concerns mounted over FEMA's plans following NPR's report, the agency released a new statement. While reiterating its belief that emergency food and water supplies were no longer needed on the island, it said that FEMA would \"continue to support the Government of Puerto Rico to meet the needs they identify.\"\n\nIn a follow-up interview, a second FEMA spokesperson, William Booher, said that the agency still had no plans to resume shipments of new food and water to Puerto Rico.

Detroit Board of Education, and now a majority of justices seems poised to reverse it.\n\nIn 1977, the court said that while nobody is required to join a union, non-union employees can be required to pay partial dues, known as fair-share, or agency, fees. The idea is to prevent those who don't join the union from becoming \"free riders\" on the backs of union members. The caveat is that nonmembers do not have to pay for the union's lobbying and political activities.\n\nIn recent years, however, an energized, more conservative Supreme Court majority has aggressively viewed money as speech. Now it appears on the brink of a decision that would weaken public employee unions by barring these fair-share fee arrangements that currently exist in 22 states.\n\nThe case to be argued on Monday was brought by Mark Janus, a child support specialist for the state of Illinois. He is represented in court by the anti-union National Right to Work Committee, though he stresses that he is not against unions. As he puts it, \"The problem is that government has given these unions this special privilege to charge us for these fees, in essence, without my permission.\"\n\nIn his view, everything the union bargains for and that he benefits from, just means more taxes for the public.\n\nThis is the second time this issue has been argued in two years. The last time, the Obama administration joined with the teachers' union and the state of California in urging the justices to uphold the court's longstanding precedent. But the oral argument strongly suggested that the vote would be 5-to-4 to overturn the 1977 decision.\n\nWhen Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly, however, the court deadlocked 4-to-4 on the case, with all the Republican-appointed justices voting against mandatory fair-share, partial dues, and the Democratic appointees voting to uphold both the court's precedent and the partial dues.\n\nNow that the issue is back, the Trump administration has switched the government's position to oppose the unions and the many states that allow fair-share fees. And there is every reason to think that Trump appointee Justice Neil Gorsuch will side with the court's conservatives.\n\nTo get a feel for the court's thinking, take a glance back to the argument in 2016. The teachers' union, joined by the state of California, contended that fair-share arrangements prevent strikes and internal strife by providing a single elected union for the state, acting as employer, to deal with, as opposed to competing unions and groups of employees.\n\nIn many close controversies, Justice Anthony Kennedy is the justice most likely to be open to persuasion, but he is something of a purist on First Amendment free speech questions. Two years ago, he disputed the characterization of those who didn't want to pay partial union fees as \"free riders.\" Rather, he said, the union was making them into \"compelled riders.\"\n\nKennedy and other conservative justices on the court took the position that everything a public employee union bargains for involves public policy, and thus a public employee who disagrees with that policy should not be forced to pay for the negotiations.\n\nCalifornia's lawyer Edward DuMont argued that wages, hours and working conditions are not political. That prompted Chief Justice John Roberts to ask for a \"best example of something that is negotiated over in a collective bargaining agreement with a public employer that does not present a public policy question.\"\n\nDuMont replied, \"Mileage reimbursement rates or how you're going to have public safety.\"\n\n\"It's all money,\" shot back Roberts dismissively. \"If you give more mileage expenses [to teachers], the amount of money that's going to be allocated to public education as opposed to public housing, welfare benefits, that's always a public-policy issue.\"\n\nDuMont countered that nobody loses his or her right to speak when a democratically elected union represents the interests of all state employees and negotiates a contract with the state. Any employee with a disagreement is free to speak out publicly. Moreover, he said, when the state acts as an employer, and not as a sovereign, it should be able to do what private employers do \u2014maximize efficiency by negotiating with a single bargaining unit that represents the interests of all the employees.\n\nThat drew a caustic reply from Justice Kennedy who remarked, \"I suppose we could assume that a state is always benefited and is more efficient if it can suppress speech.\"\n\nMillions of employees might be affected\n\nThe court's liberals spoke repeatedly about the importance of consistency in the law. Justice Elena Kagan stressed that a 40-year-old court precedent should not be overruled without some compelling justification.\n\n\"This is a case in which there are tens of thousands of contracts with these provisions,\" she observed. \"Those contracts affect millions of employees, maybe as high as 10 million employees.\"\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer chimed in, \"You start overruling things, what happens to the country thinking of us as a kind of stability in a world that ... changes a lot.\"\n\nBut the conservative justices seemed unpersuaded, professing that overruling the 1977 decision shouldn't change things much. They said that if employees think they have benefited from union representation, they will still pay union dues or fair-share fees, even if the fee is not mandatory.\n\nDespite such assertions, the justices certainly know that unions are faltering in their influence. In the 1950s, about a third of the U.S. workforce was union members. Now, it's only about 11 percent overall.\n\nHowever, while the union membership rate in the private sector is a meager 6.5 percent, it's more than a third among public employees. The bottom line is because states generally require unions to bargain for and represent all workers, regardless of their membership in a union, this case is something of a dagger pointed at labor's heart.\n\nUnions fear that, if Mark Janus prevails, they would bleed operating funds to the point of ineffectiveness. There is some evidence to support that notion. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFSCME \u2014 which is the union involved in this case \u2014 conducted 600,000 one-on-one interviews with employees covered by AFSCME contracts and found that 35 percent would keep paying dues, 15 percent would not, and half were \"on the fence.\"\n\nIf those findings are accurate, a loss in the Supreme Court would mean unions would almost certainly face some unknown form of transformation or, potentially, extinction.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Asma Khalid", "body": "Report: Trump To Name CNBC Commentator Larry Kudlow As Top Economic Adviser\n\nLarry Kudlow, a conservative commentator and host on CNBC, is reportedly President Trump's new pick to replace former Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn as national economic council director, according to CNBC's reporting.\n\nKudlow would seem to be somewhat in line with his predecessor, who was a creature of Wall Street.

To that point, they'd surpassed GOP voter turnout and their own party's numbers during the same period in 2016, a presidential election year where voting numbers are typically much higher.\n\nThe rising Democratic enthusiasm mirrors what the party has already seen across the country in the nearly year and a half since President Trump was elected \u2014 more than three dozen state legislature seats changing hands, important wins in Virginia and New Jersey last year and mobilization through rallies and protests.\n\nTexas's primary brings the first actual voting in the 2018 midterm cycle, giving both parties a chance for a more concrete measure ahead of November's elections.

On the Republican side, there had been only a 15 percent uptick.\n\nA surge in Democrats on the ballot\n\nIt's not just an uptick in Democratic voters happening in Texas, but an increase in candidates putting their names on the ballot, too. Democrats are fielding a modern-day record number of candidates across the state. There are 111 U.S. House candidates running for the minority party, and they are spread across all 36 Texas congressional districts \u2014 the first time that's happened in 25 years, and a departure from two years ago when Democrats didn't run candidates in eight seats.\n\nOn a state legislative level, Democrats have candidates in 132 of the 189 state House districts and in 14 of the 15 state Senate districts up for election this year. That includes four Senate districts where Democrats didn't field candidates in 2014 or 2012, and 20 new House districts where they didn't have candidates in either 2016, 2014 or 2012.\n\nCal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University, said that the Democratic surge is even more impressive given that it's usually GOP voters, not Democrats, who have been reliable in non-presidential years.\n\n\"It's one word \u2014 enthusiasm. In a midterm election like this, what you normally expect to see is the Republicans' primary turnout might be twice what the Democratic turnout is, so to have the Democrats even with, and even slightly ahead, of Republicans in this midterm election is really extraordinary,\" Jillson said.\n\nKey suburban swing districts are likely to determine control of the House in 2018. There are several GOP-held districts like that which could be at play in Texas, such as Rep. Pete Sessions's suburban Dallas seat and Rep. John Culberson's suburban Houston district, which, along with Rep. Will Hurd's expansive border district that runs from San Antonio to El Paso, all voted for Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016.\n\n\"Going into this year, there was an expectation following the Women's March, in the wake of the elections in New Jersey and Virginia and all these special elections that something similar was likely to happen in the first-in-the-nation Texas primary, and I think it has,\" SMU's Jillson said. \"It signals a Democratic electorate that is motivated to make a statement against Donald Trump, and that motivation is nowhere more powerful than in female voters.\"\n\nThere's been a downside to the Democrats' surge of candidates in some places, however. In the primary to face Culberson, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee recently lobbed attacks against one candidate they didn't feel would be a strong challenger given past derisive comments about places in the state. That move prompted a backlash from some progressive groups and criticism from the head of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nMatt Angle, a longtime Texas Democratic strategist and director of the Lone Star Project, said the sheer number of candidates was still a positive thing for Democrats in a state where they've had trouble recruiting in the past, and noted that other primaries have been more civil. Those are encouraging signs, he said, for the way the state is trending politically.\n\n\"Make no mistake \u2014 it's a tough lift in Texas. It's a state still that is a right of center state, but I'm very encouraged,\" Angle said. \"The excitement being generated now among candidates will not only build, it will consolidate.\"\n\nPresident Trump under-performed past GOP presidential nominees in the state, carrying it in 2016 by only single digits, and a Gallup poll released at the end of January showed that the president's approval rating in Texas had dropped below 40 percent.\n\nWhile Trump's approval among Republican base voters remains strong, that dissatisfaction with the president is certainly driving Democratic turnout and convincing more disaffected voters to turn blue, Angle argued. For example, that has helped Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke in his upstart campaign to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. While O'Rourke still remains an underdog, he's been drawing large crowds and has even outraised Cruz recently with the help of small-dollar donors.\n\n\"In Texas, I think what you do have a chance to do is build a really strong coalition of Democrats, independents and fair-minded Republicans who are disillusioned with the type of leadership they're getting,\" Angle said.\n\nTexas GOP strategist Derek Ryan pointed out that Democrats do have some major statewide primaries, such as the gubernatorial race, that could be driving some turnout, but admitted that Democrats have done a good job of recruiting candidates across the board, thus making those competitive races more appealing to some voters.\n\nRyan also acknowledged that the rise in Democratic enthusiasm is worrisome for Republicans \u2014 especially because Democrats have gotten many low propensity voters to the polls. He's been diving into the early voting data, and his analysis found that many of those primary voters are ones that voted in 2016 \u2014 but haven't had a proclivity to vote yet in a midterm year when turnout typically drops off. And nearly a quarter of Democrats who cast early ballots were new voters who just registered in the past two years.\n\nOn the GOP side, Ryan found that first-time primary voters only made up about 10 percent of the early vote share, which is a dip from the 2014 midterm primaries. However, on the Democratic side, first time primary voters comprise over 22 percent of the early vote \u2014 way up from the 14 percent four years ago.\n\n\"While I don't think that Texas is going to turn blue this cycle, I do think with these turnout numbers, it could have a significant impact in some races, and some leaning Republican races in November,\" Ryan said.\n\nMatt Mackowiak, another Republican strategist in the state and chairman of the Travis County GOP, argued that the true test of Democratic enthusiasm will be on Tuesday night. He pointed out that early voting numbers also looked strong for Clinton back in 2016, but that was her high watermark and Election Day voting couldn't match Republican totals.\n\n\"For Republicans, if this is evidence of a significant enthusiasm gap, then that would be something to worry about,\" Mackowiak said. \"I'm not sure that it is yet, and just because you have stronger turnout in the primary doesn't mean it translates into Election Day vote in November.\"\n\nBut he admitted that the early numbers should give Republicans some pause and they certainly don't hold any good news if the trend continues on Tuesday.\n\n\"There's no way to look at this as positive for Republicans \u2014 it's either inconsequential, or it's bad,\" Mackowiak said.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Rachel Hubbard", "body": "Tax Cuts Put Oklahoma In A Bind.

They point to the fact that when they created the plan, business leaders from competing industries sat down at a table to find a solution and everyone had to give.\n\n\"We'd created something that no one in the room liked every part of but that everybody in the room agreed would move us forward.\" Rainbolt said. \"We thought it was salable to the legislature, and it appears that it is.\"\n\nBut the spirit of compromise hasn't reached lawmakers yet. They're now in their second special session trying to pass a budget for the current fiscal year.\n\nLobbying is fierce for the Step Up plan that is supposed to provide a more permanent revenue fix and leaders in the legislature say they're hoping to vote on it next week.

So you'll see conversations about DACA or 'release the memo' or NFL protests, so you get caught at looking at the granular level and lose focus of the big-picture narratives,\" Schafer said. \"But when you zoom out and look at what's happened over the past six months, you start seeing some patterns start to emerge.\"\n\nOftentimes bots will begin tweeting about totally innocent topics, such as a sporting event or a trending Twitter topic, as a means for expanding their audience.\n\nSchafer said he noticed the trend when he saw a number of their monitored accounts start tweeting about #MondayMotivation and #WednesdayWisdom, popular hashtags used by many American Twitter users, mixed in with content about Syria and Ukraine that Russian bots frequently discuss, in defense of Russia's interventions in those countries.\n\n\"We look at that as being the recruitment topic,\" Schafer told NPR. \"If they started shouting about Syria and Ukraine... less people would see it, and it would be less effective.\"\n\nStill, the bots don't have a unified partisan slant, even though U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russian influence operations were aimed at supporting President Trump in the 2016 campaign.\n\n\"The reality is that they also turn against Republicans,\" Fly said. \"They have gone after administration officials like [National Security Advisor H.R.] McMaster. They've attacked [House] Speaker [Paul] Ryan, [Senate Majority] Leader [Mitch] McConnell. They've attacked Republican senators Marco Rubio, [Jeff] Flake, Sen. [John] McCain on a regular basis. No one in American politics is immune from the reach of these networks.\"\n\nAnd so this is why Fly has teamed up with Laura Rosenberger, who was Hillary Clinton's foreign policy adviser during the 2016 presidential campaign. Together, they're co-directors for the Alliance for Securing Democracy's efforts to track and push back against Russian meddling in the American political system.\n\n\"The bipartisan aspect of what we're doing is actually strategically important,\" Rosenberger said, pointing to the apparent Russian goal of increasing political division.\n\nEven on Capitol Hill, where bipartisanship is the exception rather than the rule, there's a bipartisan understanding that Russia meddled in the American political process during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nRosenberger pointed to the \"nearly unanimous\" vote in Congress to impose sanctions on Russia as evidence, although the White House recently said it will not implement Russia-related sanctions that Congress required because it was not necessary at this point.\n\nStill, those on both sides of the aisle understand that there has been no letup.\n\n\"The Russian effort to undermine our democracy did not end with Election Day in 2016 \u2014 these tools, whether creation of fake accounts, or the use of automated bots, continues on an ongoing basis,\" said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, told NPR.\n\n\"This is not just an elections issue,\" added Fly, the former Rubio aide. \"The reality is that Russian interference never stopped.\"\n\nBut even Warner, who has a front row seat at briefings by the intelligence community, acknowledges that there are as yet no clear legislative answers for how to address Russian influence operations on social media networks.\n\nHe has proposed legislation that requires social media networks to disclose the source of paid political ads. But he admits that represents a small part of how Russia influences the American political debate \u2014 and puts the onus on tech companies to disrupt automated bots.\n\n\"This is really an ongoing national security issue, and I don't think we have come up with a legislative or policy solution yet that fully gets it right,\" Warner said. \"The social media companies really need to work in partnership with us in a way that we get this right, that people can know if an account is being manipulated by a foreign entity.

Corn was the first to reveal the existence of the infamous Russia dossier, the unverified collection of reports alleging connections between the Trump campaign and Russia compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele.\n\nNow, in their new book, Russian Roulette, the two men attempt to put all the pieces of the story together.\n\n\"We start the book with Donald Trump's trip to Moscow in 2013, when he really first forms this 'bromance' with Vladimir Putin,\" Isikoff says.\n\nIsikoff notes that Trump's 2013 trip to Russia for the Miss Universe pageant centered on a business deal: \"He signed a letter of intent to build a Trump Tower in Moscow with a Putin-connected oligarch, Aras Agalarov.\"\n\nIn 2016, Agalarov would later be one of the conduits for what was described to Donald Trump Jr. as an offer of help to the Trump campaign by the Russian government.\n\nThe earlier potential deal for the Moscow Trump Tower fell through, Isikoff says, after the Obama administration and the European Union imposed sanctions on Russia following the annexation of Crimea and the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut Corn says that the stalled deal may help explain other elements of the story: \"People have been trying to figure out for years the positive remarks that Donald Trump has made about Vladimir Putin ... It's almost hiding in plain sight that one reason he has for saying all these kind things about Putin is that he was always interested in doing business deals there.\"\n\nOn Trump's interest in meeting Vladimir Putin during his 2013 trip to Moscow\n\nMichael Isikoff: This is when he's presiding over the Miss Universe pageant. He goes to great lengths to try to get a meeting with Putin. It doesn't come through for a variety of interesting reasons, but he then wants to tell the world that he met with Putin anyway, and he actually repeatedly does, even though he didn't.\n\nBut you can see the seeds of the Trump-Putin relationship in that trip. And what was it all about? It was all about a business deal. He signed a letter of intent to build a Trump Tower in Moscow with a Putin-connected oligarch, Aras Agalarov, and it was something that was a very high priority for him and had been for many years.\n\nOn how the project to build a Trump Tower in Moscow influenced Trump's views on Russia\n\nIsikoff: In February 2014, Ivanka Trump travels to Moscow to scout potential sites for the Trump Tower with Emin Agalarov and the project doesn't ultimately go through. Why? ... One development that may well have played a big factor ... was ... this is right at the time Putin has annexed Crimea, invaded Ukraine, stiff sanctions are put on by the Obama administration and the European Union, including Sberbank, the bank that was going to finance the [Trump Tower] operation.\n\nAnd Rob Goldstone, who is quoted in the book \u2014 and this is, I believe, the first interview he's given to anybody about these developments \u2014 says he believes that it was the imposition of sanctions that killed the deal and that this may well have influenced Trump's view of sanctions and his advocacy later on, during the presidential campaign, of lifting sanctions on Russia.\n\nDavid Corn: Sberbank is majority-owned by the Russian state, by the Russian government. Which means that Trump was trying to enter into a deal that involved the Russian government. And, of course, no major projects can take place in Moscow \u2014 and this is a deal worth billions of dollars \u2014 without the approval of the government. And who runs the government? Vladimir Putin.\n\nOn the Trump administration's denial of Russian interference in the election\n\nDavid Corn: [Trump's circle] had reason to believe more than anybody else that there was a Russian effort to help and to boost Trump. They knew that members of their own campaign \u2014 people like George Papadopoulos and Carter Page \u2014 were making connections with Russian officials and Russian cutouts. And Trump was even briefed in Mid-August 2016 when he was a candidate about the Russian hacking of the election and still after that continued to say it wasn't happening ... Again and again and again, Trump and his defenders say that there was no contact with Russia, \"We did nothing wrong.\"\n\nPut that all together with a little bit of distance and you see how the Trump campaign and Trump himself almost in a way aided and abetted what the Russians were doing by continually denying that they had any role in the election and making it difficult for the United States and the Obama administration to forge a bipartisan response to what was happening.\n\nCorn: His name was Gen. [Valery] Gerasimov, and this came out in an obscure military journal in early 2013 and no one paid much attention to it until a translation appeared a few months later. He basically said, listen, the war of the future will not be played out in real space. It won't be between battalions and fleet of aircraft and fighter jets, it's going to come about through other means.\n\nIt was pretty stunning to see it in retrospect \u2014 [he] talked about how to take advantage of the divisions within your enemy. If you look at what happened in 2016 with the social media campaign and with the hacks and dumps that the Russians pulled off, what they did was exploit existing sometimes very bitter divisions within America.\n\nThey did it on Facebook, they did it on Twitter, they figured out how to turn Bernie Sanders supporters against Hillary Clinton, they really took advantage of some of the political conflict and strife that we're ultimately responsible for in the United States, but that was one of the things that the general pointed to that could be weaponized, and they did so quite well, I think, in 2016.\n\nSam Briger and Thea Chaloner produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

None of the other six pre-approved candidates rose above the single digits.\n\nOpposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was barred from running after organizing nationwide anti-government protests, had called for a boycott of the election and vigorous vote monitoring to uncover any irregularities. But in a country dominated by state media that have helped generate a loyal following, the Putin juggernaut plowed over any obstacles, including accusations of ballot stuffing and other violations.\n\n\"Putin is great. We trust and love him. There aren't any other candidates as of yet,\" said Roza Yarulina, 64, a retired economics teacher who was voting at a polling station in a vocational school in Yekaterinburg, 900 miles east of Moscow, on the geographical border between Europe and Asia.\n\nAs a former Communist Party member, Yarulina said she cast her ballot for Grudinin because she was sure Putin would win and wanted to support her second choice.\n\nTatyana Ovchinikova, 65, a retired college instructor dressed in a fur coat, said she respected the incumbent but was voting for Grigory Yavlinsky, a liberal economist who ended up with 1 percent of the vote.\n\n\"I've had a dream since I was a kid to put a check mark next to a candidate's name, but it hasn't come true,\" said first-time voter Grigory Dementyanov, who intentionally spoiled his ballot so someone else couldn't fill it out. The 21-year-old music student said he opposed all the candidates, and that he didn't think Navalny would have been up to the task of leading Russia.\n\nLike other large Russian cities, Yekaterinburg, with a population of 1.4 million, is more supportive of opposition candidates. But in multiple interviews across the country, voters voiced a combination of anxiety and frustration over the lack alternatives to Putin.\n\nAfter garnering a record election win with more than 55 million votes in his fourth presidential run, Putin, 65, now has a strong mandate to rule Russia for another six years.\n\nFor many Russians, the predictability of Putin's reign is preferable to new political upheavals.\n\n\"We Russians just don't want things to get any worse. You Americans always expect things to get better,\" said Anton Volkhin, 36, a distributor in Yekaterinburg for a national sausage company and the father of two. \"Too many people have too much to lose. Those who don't are still in the minority.\"\n\nIn a country that has experienced a revolution, civil war, slave labor camps, a Nazi invasion and the collapse of an empire all within the past century, many Russians express relief that at least war hasn't reached their territory. Putin's military intervention in Ukraine is widely seen by Russians as a defensive move against encroachment by the United States, while Russia's 2 \u00bd-year participation in Syria's civil war barely registers with ordinary people.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm afraid, very afraid, that war will break out,\" said Yelena Okhotenko, 36, who serves in the Russian military. \"There's constantly this aggression toward us, and we're constantly holding back. I don't know how long our country can hold out.\"\n\nThe mother of two children, Okhotenko said she has been supporting Putin since she first could vote, in 2000. \"This president did very much for Russia and my town and personally for me and my family,\" she said, standing on the refurbished embankment in the city Nizhny Tagil. \"He raised up our country, and he raised our quality of life.\"\n\nNiznhy Tagil, a two-hour drive north of Yekaterinburg, has been nicknamed \"Putingrad\" for the president's visits to the city's giant tank factory.\n\n\"You can't talk about Putin's level of support, but the level of fear,\" said Pavel Sergienya, 35, the founder of an independent trade union. \"People are afraid to openly express their opinion except in their kitchens, just like in the Soviet Union.\"\n\nAndrei Antropov is an exception. The 36-year-old volunteer for opposition leader Navalny was called in by the police three days before the election for a \"conversation\" with criminal investigators.\n\n\"I can't rule out that there will be consequences for me at work, but I'm going to continue my activism,\" said Antropov, a manager for a telecommunications company.\n\nNavalny, who spent a year building a nationwide network of campaign offices and volunteers before his candidacy was denied, focused on domestic issues such as economic stagnation and government corruption.\n\nPutin, on the other hand, highlighted Russia's return to the world stage as an independent actor that could stand up to U.S. hegemony.\n\n\"Strange as it may seem, in Russia economic problems don't convert well into political decisions,\" said Dmitry Kolezev, 33, the deputy editor of Yekaterinburg's independent news site znak.com. \"People will tighten their belts, but they won't hold the Russian government responsible for their problems as much as, say, the United States, which imposed sanctions on Russia.\"\n\nThe U.S. and European Union hit Russia with economic sanctions for annexing Crimea and backing an armed uprising in Ukraine's Donbas region in 2014. That year marked the start of a downward spiral in relations between Russia and the West.\n\nIn the week before the presidential election, those tensions increased. Britain expelled 23 Russian diplomats after accusing Moscow of being behind the poisoning of a former Russian spy on British soil. The Trump administration imposed sanctions on Russians suspected of being behind election interference and cyberattacks. Far from hurting Putin, the news added to the Kremlin's narrative that Western countries are unfairly targeting Russia for unproven transgressions.\n\nIn the runup to the vote, Putin played up his decisiveness in seizing the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine, and the election date was scheduled to coincide with the fourth anniversary of the annexation. Given that many Russians vacation in Crimea or have family there, the association was supposed to evoke a sense of pride and defiance.\n\n\"I'm voting for Putin for the first time in my life. Russia is the kind of country that always rallies around its leader in tough times,\" said Dmitry Ardanov, 41, an office security guard in Vladivostok on Russia's Pacific coast. \"Putin did one important thing, and after that I understood he's a real man: He took back Crimea and supported Donbas.\"\n\nA recent poll by the independent Levada Center shows 86 percent of Russians support the annexation of Crimea, and opposition figures such as Navalny turned off voters by questioning the legitimacy of the controversial separatist referendum, which was held after Russian troops had occupied the peninsula.\n\nWhat unites Putin's most ardent supporters and vociferous foes is uncertainty over what comes next.\n\n\"We're in a situation where there aren't any worthy alternatives, so all that's left is the hope that Putin can accomplish something in domestic politics,\" said Rim Averyanov, 27. He quit his job as a school teacher in the provincial town of Vladimir because of his low salary and is going into the private sector in Moscow.\n\nAveryanov, who opposes Putin, said he's afraid a new revolution could break out if the Kremlin fails to address pressing economic issues that are impoverishing the population. But like many government critics, Averyanov said he doesn't view Navalny as a leader tough enough to take on Russia's myriad problems.\n\nEven before preliminary election results were in Sunday evening, Navalny appeared on his YouTube channel debating Ksenia Sobchak, a pro-Western candidate who picked up less than 2 percent of the vote. Navalny rejected her offer to join forces, calling her a Kremlin tool and a \"champion of hypocrisy\" for participating in the elections.\n\nSquabbles inside Russia's fractured opposition hardly raise their profile as a viable alternative to Putin.\n\nSofia Kastilo, a 28-year-old English teacher in Tula, 100 miles south of Moscow, called Navalny and Sobchak \"clowns.\" Kastilo said she didn't believe that Navalny, who has built his popularity as an anti-corruption campaigner, could uproot graft.\n\n\"Speaking about corruption: well it existed, it exists, and it will exist,\" Kastilo said. \"If Navalny becomes president, where is the guarantee that there won't be any corruption? There is no guarantee.\"\n\nLike many Russians, Kastilo voiced concern about who will come after Putin when his fourth term comes to an end in 2024.\n\nAccording to Russia's constitution, no president can serve more than two consecutive terms.\n\nAsked after his victory if he wants to change the law, Putin said he had no such plans \u2014 yet.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Megan Pauly", "body": "Virginia Gov.

But this year, the state legislature is going into a special session to continue discussions about whether or not to include it in its budget. By the time the regular session adjourned Saturday, members of Virginia's GOP-controlled House of Delegates and Senate could not reach agreement on whether or not to expand Medicaid.\n   Republican Delegate Barry Knight from the Virginia Beach area calls it \"the 800-pound gorilla in the room.\" He's one of more than a dozen Republicans who voted to include Medicaid expansion in the House budget \u2014 along with a work requirement \u2014 this year.\n   It's a big shift in the House position on the issue and comes after 15 seats flipped in the so-called \"blue wave\" of last November's election, which also saw the election of Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam.\n   \"On the big-picture issues, I think it was a re-awakening and a call to look at things from a different perspective,\" says Republican Delegate Chris Peace, from the Richmond area.\n   \n    \n\n    \n\n   At a recent rally outside the state Capitol in Richmond, Northam continued his campaign message. \"Are you all ready to get this done?\" he called to the crowd's cheers. \"Are you ready to expand coverage?\"\n   A December poll showed over 80 percent of likely Virginia voters support an expansion.\n   \"I think the House heard that message, loud and clear. I think the Senate still needs to listen a little bit,\" Northam says.\n   He's referring to a strong movement against expansion, led by Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment from the Tidewater area in southeastern Virginia. Norment has come out against the House Republicans who want to expand. He reminds them that despite a slim margin, Republicans are still in charge and could stop Medicaid expansion.\n   \"I do think that the House of Delegates is waiting for that moment of lucidity and epiphany to realize that their majority is 51 to 49,\" Norment says.\n   But President Trump has managed to mobilize Democratic voters, says Bob Holsworth, a former political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. He thinks expansion has a greater chance this year.\n   It could pass in the Senate, he says, because of a potential wildcard.\n   That wildcard is Republican Sen. Emmett Hanger, from mostly-rural central Virginia. Hanger has expressed support for some form of Medicaid expansion, and has a track record of voting independently, says Holsworth.\n   \"What Hanger has said that's very interesting ... is that if he decides to support some version of Medicaid expansion, he says, 'There are a number of other Republicans who are going to go over with me.' \"\n   However, Hanger isn't happy about a tax on hospitals that has been incorporated into the House's budget to help pay for the state's share of expansion costs. The tax accounts for about three quarters of the over $400 million Medicaid-related gulf between House and Senate budgets.\n   If legislators don't come up with a budget that includes Medicaid expansion, Northam has a plan B. He says he'll introduce an amendment to add it back into the budget. In the amendment process, the lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, gets a vote if the Senate ties. Fairfax says he'd be happy to vote to expand coverage to up to 400,000 low-income Virginians.\n   \"There are so many people that we can help and we have the means to do it if we expand Medicaid. We just have to have the political will to do it,\" Fairfax says.\n   Among those expansion would help in Virginia: low-income adults without children.\n   \"An adult who does not have children can have zero income \u2014 can be totally impoverished \u2014 and they cannot get Medicaid,\" says Jill Hanken with the Virginia Poverty Law Center.\n   And a family of three with a total income of about $10,000 doesn't qualify for Medicaid, she says.\n   \"It's hard to explain to them that they don't have a choice, they're not eligible for Medicaid,\" she says, and they're not eligible for subsidies for insurance on the exchange, so health insurance is out of reach. \"And the reason is because Virginia hasn't expanded Medicaid,\" she says.\n   The special session begins April 11.

Trump frequently referenced Saucier's case during the 2016 campaign as an example of what he said was an individual punished for a lesser offense than what his rival, Hillary Clinton, did with classified information on her private email server when she was secretary of state.\n\nSaucier's lawyers also cited Clinton's case in an attempt to receive leniency in sentencing proceedings, which took place during the height of the campaign. Prosecutors rejected the comparison for several reasons, including the fact that Saucier acknowledged wrongdoing.\n\nSaucier served as a machinist's mate on the USS Alexandria, a nuclear attack submarine, from 2007 to 2012. According to court documents, he used his personal cellphone to take six photos of classified areas, instruments and equipment in the sub \u2014 including the nuclear reactor \u2014 in 2009.\n\nAfter being interviewed by the FBI in 2012, Saucier destroyed a computer, camera and memory card. Investigators later found pieces of a laptop computer stashed in the woods on a property owned by a relative of Saucier.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged Saucier in 2015 with the illegal retention of defense information. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12 months in prison. He was released in September 2017.\n\nAt the White House on Friday, Sanders said Saucier was 22 when he committed the offenses, and noted that he has served out his sentence.

Sessions has intervened in two cases that could have big implications for people who come to the U.S. and seek asylum.  \n   This comes as the number of applications for asylum has risen sharply in recent years. Sessions has been trying to eliminate what he's called \"rampant fraud and abuse\" in those applications, and to cut into a massive backlog of immigration cases.  \n   But immigrant rights advocates fear that legitimate asylum-seekers, including victims of domestic violence, could be denied sanctuary here.  \n   \"They are amongst the most vulnerable people in our society,\" said Jeremy McKinney, an immigration lawyer in North Carolina, and secretary of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \"To have their rights curtailed so that the system moves faster I think should be considered a moral outrage,\" he said.  \n   \n    \n\n    \n\n   \n            \n\n    \n        \n            \n                Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been trying to eliminate what he's called \"rampant fraud and abuse\" in asylum applications to cut into a massive backlog of immigration cases. \"The system is being gamed, there's no doubt about it,\" Sessions said last year.\n                \n                \n                    \n                    Susan Walsh/AP\n                    \n                \n                hide caption\n            \n\n        \n\n\n\n            toggle caption\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n        Susan Walsh/AP\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been trying to eliminate what he's called \"rampant fraud and abuse\" in asylum applications to cut into a massive backlog of immigration cases. \"The system is being gamed, there's no doubt about it,\" Sessions said last year.\n\n        \n            \n            Susan Walsh/AP\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n   \n\n   To Attorney General Sessions, the outrage is that immigrants are gumming up the courts with false claims.  \n   \"The system is being gamed, there's no doubt about it,\" Sessions said in October of last year, in a speech to the Executive Office for Immigration Review in Virginia. Back then, he was asking Congress to tighten asylum rules. Last week, he acted on this own.  \n   In one case, the attorney general vacated a precedent-setting ruling that said most asylum seekers have a right to a hearing in front of a judge before their claim could be rejected. In a second case, Sessions is reviewing whether victims of \"private crime\" should qualify for asylum.  \n   These moves come as no surprise to anyone who's followed Sessions's positions on immigration and asylum. \n   \"We can close loopholes and clarify our asylum laws to ensure that they help those they were intended to help,\" Sessions said in his October speech. \"As this system becomes overloaded with fake claims, it cannot deal effectively with just claims.\"  \n   Immigration courts do face a huge backlog \u00e2\u20ac\u201d upwards of 600,000 cases, more than triple the number in 2009.  \n   One factor driving that growing backlog is constant stream of women and children from Central America. Many of these migrants claim they're eligible for asylum because they've been the victims of gangs, or domestic violence, in their home countries.  \n   But some, like former immigration judge Andrew Arthur, are skeptical about this kind of claim.  \n   \"It's actually become sort of a catchall for truly inventive lawyers,\" said Arthur, who is now a fellow at the Center for Immigration studies, which advocates for lower levels of immigration.  \n   Immigration courts work differently than regular courts. They're part of the Justice Department, so the attorney general has the power to personally overturn decisions by immigration courts. \n   Arthur, the former immigration judge, applauds the recent moves by Sessions. \"One, it is going to streamline the system,\" Arthur said. \"Two, it's going to cut down on the number of claims that are inevitably going to be found to be invalid.\"  \n   Immigration lawyers don't dispute that the number of asylum applications has spiked. But they offer a different explanation. \n   \"The crisis we're managing is not one of fraud,\" said Lenni Benson, a professor at New York Law School, \"but one of the global situation.\" She pointed to a rise in gang-related violence in Central America that's pushing migrants north in search of safety.  \n   Not every crime makes the victim eligible to claim asylum. The victim must have a well-founded fear of persecution based on certain factors like race or religion, or membership in a \"particular social group.\" They must also come from a place where the government won't help them. The law around this has been fiercely litigated, says McKinney, the immigration lawyer.  \n   \"The fear is that this Justice Department will undo all of those gains that were made through decades of litigation,\" he said.  \n   McKinney and other lawyers are worried that Sessions is ultimately going to overturn a landmark asylum case from 2014 that made it easier for domestic violence survivors to get asylum. \n   People like Aracely Martinez, who fled to the U.S. from Honduras and got asylum with help from the Tahirih Center for Justice, a nonprofit that supports immigrant women fleeing from violence. \n   \"My ex's family wanted to kill me,\" she said through a translator.

Hatch told The Salt Lake Tribune that he was urging Romney to run.\n\nRomney is seen as an early favorite to win the Senate seat, but not every Republican in the state is happy he's running. He's facing criticism, for example from, of all people, the state Republican Party chairman.\n\n\"I think he's keeping out candidates that I think would be a better fit for Utah,\" Rob Anderson told the Tribune, \"because, let's face it, Mitt Romney doesn't live here, his kids weren't born here, he doesn't shop here.\"\n\nRomney was governor of Massachusetts, where he was a registered voter and ran his private investment firm, Bain Capital. He also has lived most of the time at his beachside home in San Diego.\n\nBut Romney also owns a home in Park City, Utah, and has close ties to the leadership of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In addition to serving as a missionary for the church in France in the 1960s, he has held several leadership positions, including lay bishop.

Early Senate race polling has shown Romney comfortably ahead in hypothetical matchups against Democrat Jenny Wilson, who currently sits on the Salt Lake County Council.\n\nHow he got here\n\nRomney ran for the Senate in Massachusetts in 1994, losing to Democrat Ted Kennedy. He was elected as the state's governor in 2002.\n\nIn the interim, Romney stepped in to turn around the scandal-plagued 2002 Salt Lake Winter Olympics, which vaulted his reputation in Utah.\n\nHis connection to his church has also been key. In fact, that connection goes back generations. Romney's great-great-grandfather Miles Romney was a Mormon pioneer, who settled in Utah in the 19th century and designed the famed St. George Tabernacle.\n\nIn 2012, Romney won nearly 73 percent share of the vote in Utah, soundly defeating President Barack Obama there by 48 points. Contrast that with the 2016 presidential race. While Donald Trump won Utah, he only received 46 percent of the vote.\n\nMany Utahans, fueled by their growing unease with Trump's divisive rhetoric, instead cast their vote for Evan McMullin, a third-party candidate and a Mormon, who got 21 percent.\n\nRomney's stature in the GOP and history of criticizing Trump create the potential for a powerful Trump Republican critic coming to Washington as others like Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona retire.\n\nHere's how NPR's Mara Liasson envisioned the scenario playing out in a report from December:\n\nAfter clashes between white nationalists and counterprotesters turned deadly in August in Charlottesville, Va., Romney was critical of the president's early response in which Trump said there was \"blame on both sides.\" Romney condemned Trump's response in a Facebook post, saying Trump's comments \"caused racists to rejoice.\"\n\nHe also criticized Trump's reported vulgar comments about African nations and Haiti last month.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Romney excoriated Trump by delivering a speech at the University of Utah. \"Here's what I know. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud,\" Romney said, later adding, \"He has neither the temperament nor the judgment to be president. And his personal qualities would mean that America would cease to be a shining city on a hill.\"\n\nTrump returned fire, accusing Romney of being willing to do anything for his endorsement in 2012.\n\n\"He was begging for my endorsement,\" Trump said. \"I could have said, 'Mitt, drop to your knees,' he would have dropped to his knees.\"\n\nStill, after the campaign, Romney was floated as a possible secretary of state candidate for Trump. The two met during Trump's transition into the White House to discuss the role. No offer materialized, but Romney was photographed looking on awkwardly.\n\nWhen Hatch announced his retirement, amid much speculation about Romney's run, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked whether Trump would commit to campaigning for the eventual GOP nominee.\n\n\"I don't think we've made a determination in terms of campaigning, but the president certainly has the greatest and deepest amount of respect for Sen. Hatch and his over four decades of experience in the Senate,\" Sanders said at the time.\n\nMonths prior to Hatch's announcement, Trump publicly and privately tried to persuade the 83-year-old senator to seek re-election this year.\n\nThe president showered Hatch with praise at a Salt Lake City event in December. \"You are a true fighter, Orrin,\" Trump said. Another time, the president said he hopes Hatch stays in the Senate \"for a long time to come.\"\n\nWith his Senate run, Romney has an opportunity to change perceptions that dogged him throughout his presidential campaign \u2014 that he is an out-of-touch plutocrat, detached from the realities lived by many Americans.\n\nMuch of Romney's considerable personal wealth, at the time estimated to be about $250 million, was attained as a venture capitalist in the 1980s as the head of the firm Bain Capital.\n\nRomney tried to counter that image by picking a wonky, more energetic and self-proclaimed \"young gun\" running mate in Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who was at the time the chairman of the House Budget Committee. As NPR reported at the time, the pick energized some in the GOP base but ultimately did not win him the White House. Ryan is now speaker of the House, and the two remain in contact.\n\nTwo issues that Romney contended with in 2012, and that still haunt the GOP today, are health care and Russia.\n\nLike many Republicans, Romney vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature achievement, even though he started a similar program as governor of Massachusetts.\n\nAnd at the time, Romney was mocked for saying Russia was the country's top \"geopolitical foe.\"\n\n\"[Russia] is, without question, our No. 1 geopolitical foe,\" he told CNN in 2012. \"They fight every cause for the world's worst actors. The idea that he has some more flexibility in mind for Russia is very, very troubling, indeed.\"\n\nRomney appeared to be offering a prescient warning after the Russian efforts to influence the 2016 campaign came to light.

The report indicated the FBI is investigating whether a Russian banker with ties to the Kremlin illegally funneled money to the NRA in order to aid President Donald Trump's campaign.\n\n\"We expect the FEC to get to the bottom of this issue swiftly and deliver the results of a thorough investigation to the American people,\" Woodhouse said.\n\nThe banker, Aleksandr Torshin, has ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He's also a lifetime member of the NRA and led a delegation of senior NRA leaders to Russia in 2015.\n\nOn multiple occasions, according to media reports over the last year, Torshin tried to engage with Trump's presidential campaign, seeking in particular to meet with Donald Trump, and through an intermediary had proposed the NRA's convention in 2016 as a possible meeting spot. Ultimately, he did not get a meeting, but he met with Donald Trump Jr. at the NRA's 2016 convention.The National Rifle Association spent some $30 million to support Trump in the 2016 presidential race, close to triple what they spent supporting Mitt Romney in 2012. However, no public evidence has emerged showing that the NRA took any money from Russians.\n\n\"The National Rifle Association has not been contacted by the FBI or any other investigative body,\" spokesman Andrew Arulanandam told NPR.\n\nThe NRA's links to Russia were highlighted behind closed doors by Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, the founder of the firm that commissioned a dossier on Trump's ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign. In private testimony before the House Intelligence Committee in November, Simpson alleged closed ties between the Russian government and the NRA.\n\n\"It appears the Russians, you know, infiltrated the NRA,\" Simpson told the panel, in a since-released transcript. \"It appears that the Russian operation was designed to infiltrate conservative organizations. And they targeted various conservative organizations, religious and otherwise, and they seem to have made a very concerted effort to get in with the NRA.\"\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee has looked into this matter, the panel's top Democrat said, but whether it could proceed on a bipartisan basis is unclear.\n\n\"Whether there was an effort by Russia to create a backchannel or assist the Trump campaign through the NRA is a question the Committee has endeavored to answer,\" Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) told NPR. \"Much work remains to be done concerning that thread of our investigation, although it is not at all clear that the Majority will permit the Committee to do so.\"\n\nThe prospect of having two of the left's most prominent villains caught up in an illegal conspiracy has caught the eye of several organizations on the left, and the ALDF's legal complaint is only the latest salvo in a broader campaign to tie Russia, Trump and the NRA together.\n\nLast week, NRA opponent Everytown for Gun Safety released a new interactive website on these three actors, so that its activists could familiarize itself with their reported ties.\n\n\"For years, the NRA cozied up to Moscow, even as Russia meddled in our elections. Now they won't answer any questions about it,\" said John Feinblatt, the president of the group. \"It makes you wonder how much the gun lobby really spent on Trump in 2016 and where that money might've come from.\"\n\nAnd liberal media watchdog Media Matters blared in a headline: \"NRA's denial it has illegal ties to Russia hits stumbling block with revelation of FBI investigation.\"\n\nBut despite the links that exist between Torshin and the National Rifle Association, even some liberals note that the scenario seems so fantastical that it is hard to imagine that it is real.\n\n\"A scenario in which the Russian investigation ensnares the N.R.A., probably the most influential conservative group in the United States, seems a bit too much like Resistance fan fiction, too delicious to be true,\" columnist Michelle Goldberg wrote in the New York Times.\n\nThe ALDF's complaint helps draw attention to the issue, but faces long odds on whether the FEC will actually take action. If it does, the process will take years and would need to work its way through a notoriously gridlocked commission that currently has more Republican than Democratic members.\n\n\"You should be skeptical about whether the FEC will take any action... Before the 2018 elections, you're not going to learn anything,\" campaign finance lawyer Brett Kappel said. \"The odds are against [an imminent FEC investigation], especially if there's an ongoing criminal investigation.

The federal government has spent much less on research into gun violence than on similarly lethal issues, such as motor vehicle crashes, liver disease and sepsis.\n\n\"Most of the effects that we were looking for evidence on, we didn't find any evidence,\" says Andrew Morral, a behavioral scientist at RAND and the leader of the project.\n\nThey found, for example, no clear evidence regarding the effects of any gun policies on hunting and recreational gun use, or on officer-involved shootings, or on mass shootings or on the defensive use of guns by civilians.\n\nThere were some categories with better data, however, Morral says. There is relatively strong evidence, for example, that policies meant to prevent children from getting access to firearms \u2014 such as laws that require guns to be stored unloaded, or in locked containers \u2014 reduce both suicide and unintentional injury and death.\n\nPrevious work has also found that places that require a permit (issued by law enforcement) for the purchase a firearm do reduce violent crime.\n\nThere is also some evidence that prohibitions against purchase by people who have been diagnosed with mental illness reduce violent crime, and that \"stand your ground\" laws, which allow citizens who feel threatened in public to use lethal force without retreating first, lead to an increase in violent crime.\n\nIn general, however, good studies were few and far between, the RAND researchers say.\n\nTo help bridge the data gap for scientists, RAND has now compiled an open-source database of state-by-state gun laws going back to 1979. A similar, unrelated database run out of Boston University was published last year.\n\n\"Given the lack of data in the firearm research field, [the RAND database] will be a welcome addition, and I'm sure it will be valuable to researchers,\" says Dr. Michael Siegel, the physician who leads the Boston University project. He notes that, since it launched, the Boston database has been most helpful for journalists writing about gun violence.\n\n\"It's funny because I didn't actually think about that as a purpose of the project when we started it,\" says Siegel \"but it seems to have become the primary use of the database so far (in addition to use by other researchers).\"\n\nThe RAND team also surveyed 95 gun policy experts from across the political spectrum about what they thought the effects of 15 different gun policies would be on 12 outcomes. The policies included universal background checks, bans on the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, expanded mental illness prohibitions, minimum age requirements and required reporting of lost or stolen weapons.\n\nMany of the policies are now being considered by state and federal lawmakers, after a man used an AR-15-style rifle to kill 17 people at a Florida high school in February.\n\nThe vast majority of the specialists Rand surveyed agreed that the primary objectives of gun policies should be reducing suicides and homicides, and that protecting privacy, enabling hunting and sport shooting and preventing mass shooting were secondary priorities.\n\n\"That was a surprise, actually,\" says Morral. \"I think people on either side of gun policy debates think that the other side has misplaced values \u2014 or that it's a values problem, in any case. But that's not what we find. We find people prioritize the same things in the same order.\"\n\nHowever, those surveyed varied widely in their predictions about how different policies would affect each outcome.\n\n\"Where they disagree is on which laws will achieve those those objectives. So this is a disagreement about facts,\" says Morral. \"And the facts are sparse.\"", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Tom Dreisbach", "body": "Former Trump Campaign Adviser Was More Than A Coffee Boy, Fiancee Says\n\nEver since Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller unveiled charges against George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump 2016 presidential campaign, the White House has insisted Papadopoulos played an unimportant role in the campaign.\n\nAccording to court papers, Papadopoulos was told in April 2016 that Russia had \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton in the form of \"thousands of emails.\" As the world found out later, that information was true. The meeting took place shortly after John Podesta's Gmail account was breached, in addition to the earlier hack of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nIt remains unclear what, if anything, Papadopoulos told the campaign about that conversation. A key question in the Mueller investigation is what Papadopoulos told the campaign, and what, if anything, the campaign did with that information.\n\nBut after the charges became public, the White House immediately distanced itself from Papadopoulos.\n\n\"He was somebody that played a minimal role, if one at all,\" said press secretary Sarah Sanders last fall.\n\n\"I never heard of Papadopoulos,\" former Trump adviser Michael Caputo told CNN. \"He was the coffee boy.\"\n\nMore recently, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the chairman of the House intelligence committee and an ally of the Trump White House, told Fox News that Papadopoulos \"never even had met with the president.\"\n\nThis is false. Then-candidate Trump tweeted a photo of a foreign policy meeting with several advisers, including Papadopoulos. Nunes' recently released memo also makes clear that the FBI began its investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential race and possible connections between Russia and the Trump campaign because of Papadopoulos.\n\nPapadopoulos himself has not spoken publicly since he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, leaving the administration's narrative more or less unchallenged.\n\nBut his fiancee, Simona Mangiante, has decided to defend Papadopoulos whenever journalists will listen, and is telling a much different story than the one coming from the White House.\n\n\"I felt this frustration for him,\" Mangiante tells NPR's Embedded. \"And that's why I accepted to speak.\"\n\nMangiante is from Italy, and she first met Papadopoulos after the presidential campaign, when Papadopoulos sent her a message on LinkedIn. Mangiante and Papadopoulos had actually both briefly worked at the same office in London \u2014 the London Centre for International Law Practice \u2014 though at different times. That office was run by the \"professor\" described in court papers filed by the special counsel's office, a man later identified as the Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud.\n\nMifsud has previously worked in Malta's foreign ministry, and ran a university in Slovenia.\n\nHe has denied any connections to the Russian government and denied ever telling Papadopoulos about \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton, but since the fall, he has largely disappeared. He did not respond to NPR's requests for comment.\n\nMangiante's story is now providing new detail about Mifsud, but she acknowledges that he remains mysterious even to her.\n\nMangiante first got to know Mifsud when she worked as a legal adviser to the European Parliament, and he recruited her.\n\n\"He was interested to hire young people with political connections,\" she says, \"to have access to their networks.\"\n\nShe says she worked in Mifsud's London office for about three months, but to this day, she does not understand what she was supposed to do at the office. There was \"no work agenda,\" she says, and the office consisted of a single table and a rotating group of people working on their own laptops.\n\nAt one point, she says, she was asked to attend a \"secret symposium\" on Iraq, but the organizers would not tell her key details, like who else would be attending. She received a plane ticket, but decided not to go, given the secrecy.\n\nShe also says she was never paid for her work, and after three months, she decided to leave. (Mangiante shared her resignation letter with NPR, where she mentions the lack of pay.)\n\nFor nearly a year, Mangiante says her experience with Mifsud remained a bit of a mystery. But now that the U.S. government alleges that Mifsud had connections to the Russian government, she says \"it makes sense.\"\n\nSince the allegations came out, the London Centre for International Law Practice appears to have shut down. When NPR's Frank Langfitt recently tried to visit the office, he was turned away.\n\nMangiante says her relationship with Papadopoulos began around April 2017, and was \"love at first sight.\" A few months later, after a European vacation the young couple took, Papadopoulos was arrested after arriving at Dulles International Airport in the Washington, D.C., area. He later entered a guilty plea for lying to the FBI and is cooperating with authorities.\n\nMangiante says she has also been questioned by federal agents.\n\nShe says she cannot speak on behalf of Papadopoulos, on the advice of his lawyers. But she wants to correct the record about her fiance and his role on the campaign, which she says was much larger than the White House claims.\n\nFor one, Mangiante confirmed to NPR that Papadopoulos organized a meeting between Donald Trump and the president of Egypt during the campaign, a story first reported by the New York Times.\n\n\"I never heard of anybody bringing coffee and organizing meetings with presidents,\" she says.\n\nShe also confirmed that Papadopoulos helped edit Donald Trump's April 2016 foreign policy speech, where Trump said, \"I believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia - from a position of strength only - is possible. Absolutely possible.\"\n\nWhen NPR asked if everything Papadopoulos did during the campaign was authorized by the top levels of the campaign, she responded unequivocally:\n\n\"Yes. That's my understanding.\"\n\nShe also says it will be \"easy to prove\" how significant Papadopoulos' role was, because \"all of his communication, professional communication with other people with the campaign [was] via email.\"\n\nOnce Papadopoulos is sentenced for lying to the FBI, Mangiante says he will finally be able to tell his side of the story. \"After sentencing, he will definitely talk,\" she says. \"And he will say everything I can't say.\"\n\nIn the meantime, she is spending time with Papadopoulos in his hometown of Chicago.\n\nAnd she recently made a new purchase.\n\n\"I bought for George a coffee machine,\" she says, \"and he was laughing at me.

Ultimately the attorney general decides whether an indictment will be filed, and that could take months.\n\nNetanyahu \u2014 the longest-serving prime minister since Israel's founding father David Ben-Gurion \u2014 denies wrongdoing. He has repeatedly criticized the police investigation as a baseless attempt to bring him down, and Estrin reported the prime minister pleaded his case on Facebook Thursday, writing he's done nothing wrong. He also argued that lead investigator is biased against him, but has portrayed the investigations as something that's not about him personally but a left-wing media attempt to topple his right-wing government.\n\nIn December, Parliament passed a law sponsored by a member of Netanyahu's party making it harder for police to disclose when they recommend indictments of top officials. Although it has no impact on the current investigation, with the new law it is now up to the attorney general to ask police to submit their findings in criminal investigations against public figures.\n\nCritics see the legal measure as an attempt to protect Netanyahu, who could face public pressure to resign in light of the allegations.\n\nPolice have previously recommended charges be brought against Netanyahu but there was ultimately no indictment.\n\nHe vowed Tuesday to remain in office. As quoted by the Associated Press, he said, \"I will continue to lead Israel responsibly and faithfully for as long as you, the citizens of Israel choose me to lead you. ... I am certain, I am certain, that the truth will be revealed, and I am certain that at the next elections, which will be held on schedule, I will earn your trust again, with God's help.\"", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "", "body": "President Trump hosted lawmakers from both parties to discuss gun policy and school safety on Wednesday.

Here's Why Only Some Strike It Rich\n\nThe U.S. is one of only a few countries in the world that allow private individuals to own the minerals under their land, a policy that dates to the Founding Fathers as they sought to elevate private interests over those of the British Crown. This financial incentive to allow new drilling goes a long way in explaining the nation's natural gas boom. The National Association of Royalty Owners estimates some 12 million American landowners receive royalties for the exploitation of oil, gas and other mineral resources under their property.\n\nBut as U.S. production reaches record levels \u2014 it recently surpassed the previous high point in 1970 \u2014 a complex web of laws and court rulings is evolving over how these royalties are distributed. That's creating vast differences in how much money property owners actually get and prompting a number of lawsuits accusing energy companies of shortchanging them.\n\nThis disparity is playing out across Pennsylvania's gas-rich Marcellus Shale.\n\nWhen natural gas companies approached Charlie Clark and Jim Barrett, two farmers living in neighboring counties, both decided to let them drill.\n\nClark says it felt like he had \"won the lottery,\" and he is grateful every day for the two gas wells drilled on his dairy farm. He estimates he receives about $10,000 per month in the form of gas royalties.\n\n\"This is what we've done with our gas money,\" Clark says, standing in his new barn filled with cows. \"This barn here cost $40,000 to build it, and we were able to build it out of our pocket.\"\n\nWhen he was growing up in rural Susquehanna County in the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, his family used to scrimp and save just to buy basics, like new shoes.\n\nNow, since the drilling rigs rolled into town and he started receiving royalty checks, Clark has a newfound sense of financial security.\n\n\"We're living like we used to, but without the stress,\" Clark says. \"The bills are all paid. Your kid's gotta go to college? No problem.\"\n\nHe's a good example of when the royalty process works. It goes like this: Gas companies and landowners sign a lease agreement before drilling begins. The royalty is money paid to the mineral owner, like Clark, for the right to use his resource. It's negotiated to be a certain percentage of the revenue from the sale of the gas.\n\nClark is leased to a company called Chief Oil and Gas. The company gets gas it needs, and Clark gets paid. But he knows other people with similar gas wells are striking out.\n\n\"I thank God every day that it happened here,\" he says, and not a few miles to the west.\n\nThat's where Jim Barrett lives, about 40 miles away in Bradford County on what he describes as \"a pretty typical mountain farm.\"\n\nLike Clark, he is grateful for the drilling.\n\n\"It kept Bradford County alive,\" he says. If not for the gas industry, he says, his community \"would have been a ghost town in 2008 or 2010\" after the Great Recession.\n\nBut for Barrett, the gas boom has not panned out the way he had hoped.\n\nHe says Chesapeake Energy, which operates four wells on his farm, is stealing from him, and he has joined a class-action lawsuit against the company. Chesapeake, which declined to comment for this story, is defending itself against lawsuits in at least seven states for allegedly underpaying royalties.\n\nBy Barrett's calculations, Chesapeake owes him hundreds of thousands of dollars for the gas it has pumped out of his farm. The company has said in the past that it is committed to working with its royalty owners to answer questions.\n\nClark and Barrett might have started out with similar hopes, but their different experiences show how tough it can be for landowners to navigate the gas business and how resolutions are hard to come by.\n\nMuch of the controversy surrounding royalty money boils down to a concept known as post-production costs: the expenses of moving and treating gas through a network of pipelines. To cover the costs, drillers might take deductions from royalty checks.\n\nSome landowners agree to that, while others negotiate a lease that prohibits it, says attorney John McFarland, who represents landowners with the Texas-based law firm Graves, Dougherty, Hearon and Moody. Many others sign leases that don't address it at all. Even when possible deductions are addressed, McFarland says, the lease language can be vague. That leaves room for a gas company to take deductions even if a landowner objects.\n\nDisputes over post-production costs have popped up all over the country as oil and gas production has soared, the result of new horizontal drilling and fracking technologies that allow drillers to tap into shale rock.\n\nBy 2014, the United States was producing so much oil and gas that it led to a global oversupply. That's when complaints over these deductions really started to roll in, says Gary Preszler, vice president of the National Association of Royalty Owners board.\n\nMany energy-producing states took a hit during the downturn, as companies went bankrupt, workers were laid off, and tax revenue collected from oil and gas dropped. In most of them, like North Dakota, where Preszler lives, wells produce both oil and gas. When prices plummeted, oil suddenly wasn't worth what it used to be, he says, but the gas still needed to be transported and treated, and that cost stayed constant.\n\n\"That's when people saw their checks being reduced significantly,\" he says. Some even received statements with a negative balance, meaning they wouldn't receive more royalties until the balance turned positive again.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, wells produce mainly gas, so landowners like Barrett noticed right away when companies took out big, unexplained cuts. Some Pennsylvania landowners have been complaining for years about exorbitant deductions. Still, many never have a reason to complain. Clark, for example, says he feels his deductions are reasonable.\n\nOver the years, some landowners sued when they felt they were being cheated. That has led to a patchwork of court rulings in many states, determining how leases are interpreted.\n\nSome landowners hire a lawyer to negotiate a lease with explicit language that prohibits deductions or spells out exactly which costs can be taken out. The greater stake an individual has in a well, the more bargaining power he or she has to negotiate a lease that works in his or her favor, says University of Texas law professor Owen Anderson.\n\nBut not all go that route.\n\n\"As often happens, these landowners and mineral owners sign these leases the company offers without negotiating terms and without getting legal advice,\" Anderson says.\n\nLater, if they believe they're not getting paid fairly, their options are slim. They can hire an expert to audit their royalties and go to court, but some can't afford to do that.\n\nPreszler says the better option is to prevent landowners from signing bad leases.\n\n\"It's a lot easier to try to get the terms correctly done at the front end than to try to manage and fix a problem later,\" he says. His group is developing a seminar to better educate landowners.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, a decades-old law guarantees a minimum 12.5 percent royalty. But the state's Supreme Court has ruled that deductions can still be taken, even if they cut into that rate. For four years, mineral owners have pushed to keep that from happening, but so far the Legislature has not passed a bill.\n\nIt's a different story in West Virginia, where royalty owners just scored a victory. Lawmakers did step in after the state Supreme Court sided with energy companies in a case last year. Now, the governor has signed a new law prohibiting gas and oil companies from deducting post-production expenses in certain types of leases.\n\nMeanwhile, lawsuits are playing out in several states, including one brought by Pennsylvania's attorney general accusing several gas companies of stiffing thousands of landowners by promising royalty money that was never paid. So far, he has not agreed to an offer by Chesapeake Energy to settle its royalty cases in the state for $30 million.\n\nBack on his farm in Susquehanna County, Clark says even though he is pleased with his gas royalties, he thinks the law should ensure everyone is paid fairly.\n\n\"I guess I really don't understand why the government hasn't stepped in and done a little bit more, because it would benefit them too,\" he says. \"Any extra money we'd get, we'd be taxed on.\"\n\nOver in Bradford County, Barrett just wants to protect his family's legacy. \"Every farmer would say they want their farm to continue,\" he says.\n\nBarrett's land was passed down from his great-grandfather, and he hopes to hand it over to his grandchildren. But without the royalty money he expected, he and his wife may have to sell the farm to retire.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Geoff Brumfiel", "body": "Today, the Trump administration released a report on the state of America's nuclear weaponry. The assessment, known as a Nuclear Posture Review, mainly concerns U.S. nukes and missiles.\n\nBut buried in the plan is a mention of a mysterious Russian weapon called \"Status-6.\" On paper, at least, Status-6 appears to be a kind of doomsday device. The report refers to it as \"a new intercontinental, nuclear-armed, nuclear-powered, undersea autonomous torpedo.\"\n\n\"The radius of total or near-total destruction is the size of a pretty large metropolitan area, actually,\" says Edward Geist, a Russia specialist at the RAND Corporation who has spent time looking at the weapon. \"It's difficult to imagine in normal terms.\"\n\nStatus-6 made its first public appearance in 2015, while Russian President Vladimir Putin was visiting with his generals in the city of Sochi.\n\nRussia state television reported on the visit. The camera shows Putin seated at a long table. Then it cuts to a shot over one of the general's shoulders. He's looking at what appears to be a drawing of a new nuclear weapon called the Oceanic Multipurpose System Status-6.\n\nStatus-6 looks like a giant torpedo about a third the length of a big Russian submarine. According to the slide, it is nuclear-powered, meaning it can roam for months and even possibly years beneath the ocean without surfacing. Its payload is a nuclear warhead \"many tens of megatons in yield,\" Geist says.\n\nThat's thousands of times more powerful than the bombs dropped at the end of World War II and more powerful than anything currently in the U.S. and Russian arsenals.\n\nStatus-6 would launch from beneath a Russian submarine. It would shoot at a depth too deep to be intercepted, and travel for thousands of miles. Upon reaching its target along the U.S. coastline, it would detonate, swallowing up whatever city happened to be nearby.\n\n\"The only possible U.S. targets are large port cities,\" says Mark Schneider, a senior analyst with the National Institute for Public Policy wrote in an e-mail. \"The detonation of Status-6 in any of them would essentially wipe out their population into the far suburbs.\"\n\n\"The detonation would cause a very large amount of radioactive fallout,\" adds Pavel Podvig, an arms control expert who runs a blog called Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces. Podvig believes the weapon could potentially bathe the entire Northeast Corridor in radioactive soot.\n\nStatus-6 would probably be used as a \"third-strike\" weapon of last resort. If Russia fell under attack from the U.S. and couldn't retaliate with its missiles, it might trigger Status-6: A doomsday machine. Or at least a doomsday-ish machine.\n\nThen again, the whole thing might be a fake.\n\n\"The drawing of this drone looks more like an enlarged drawing of a smaller torpedo,\" says Podvig. In other words, it looks like the Russians may have just taken some torpedo clip-art, blown it up to terrifying size and then broadcast it on state television.\n\n\"It's a way to get our attention,\" says Geist.\n\nGeist says that the \"leak\" of Status-6 was deliberate. Russia worries that U.S. missile defenses might be able to shoot down its missiles in a nuclear war. By showing a plan for Status-6, Russia is warning the U.S. that if it continues to build such defensive systems, then Russia will find another way to strike: one that can't be intercepted.\n\n\"My read of the whole Status-6 slide leak is that the Russians were trying to send us a message,\" Geist says.\n\nPodvig agrees that the leak of Status-6 is probably just a warning shot. But the fact it appeared in the Pentagon's newest report on nuclear weapons shows that some war planners are taking the idea seriously.\n\nThere may be some politics involved in that decision as well, says Hans Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists. The Trump administration is pushing hard for upgrades to America's nuclear arsenal. In his State of the Union address, the president called for making the arsenal \"so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression by any other nation or anyone else.\"\n\nCiting Status-6 helps to build the case that upgrades to American nukes are needed, Kristensen says.\n\nFor all the rhetoric around Status-6, Podvig and Geist both believe that the program isn't completely made-up. Geist says a long-range underwater drone without a nuclear warhead would be a useful weapon.\n\n\"You could use it for tapping our underwater communications cables,\" he says. \"Or simpler, in a war, is just going out and like finding them and cutting them.\"\n\nStatus-6 could also carry conventional munitions, like cruise missiles, and launch them after hiding for months beneath the water.\n\nPodvig has seen photos which he says indicate the Russians are working on some hardware for big underwater drones.\n\n\"My best guess is that there is there is a project to design an underwater vehicle with a purpose, unknown at this point,\" he says. \"There is something there.\"", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Carrie Johnson", "body": "Paul Manafort Pleads Not Guilty To Conspiracy, Tax And Bank Fraud Charges\n\nFormer Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort pleaded not guilty to conspiracy, tax and bank fraud charges in an Alexandria, Va., federal court Thursday afternoon.\n\nManafort faces a separate federal trial on September 17, 2018, on other charges also brought by special counsel Robert Mueller's office in a Washington, D.C., case.\n\nFor the Virginia case, Manafort will be fitted with a second electronic monitoring bracelet (he is already wearing one related to the D.C. case) and will be allowed to meet with lawyers, attend church services and make emergency medical trips as needed.\n\nJudge Ellis, who has been on the bench for 31 years, alternately cracked jokes and pressed lawyers for Manafort and Mueller's office on their legal positions.\n\nThe judge urged prosecutors to add a lawyer to their team experienced in practicing in the Eastern District of Virginia federal court where the Alexandria, Va., courthouse is located. \"Only a fool would try a case in a jurisdiction he's unfamiliar with, without local counsel,\" the judge said, citing wisdom of his mentor Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell.\n\nThe judge also pressed the special counsel's team about why it had brought so many charges against Manafort \u2014 18 \u2014 and whether the government case could be streamlined.\n\nProsecutor Andrew Weissmann said his case would likely take 8 to 10 trial days and involve 20 to 25 witnesses.\n\nBut Judge Ellis also pushed Manafort's defense team, which resisted a quick trial date.

Rick Saccone. The GOP nominee got an 11th-hour rescue-mission visit Saturday from President Trump, who carried the district by about 20 points in the 2016 presidential election. GOP-allied groups have poured in more than $10 million to help Saccone, who's underwhelmed in fundraising. If that's not enough to save him, it would be an embarrassing and alarming loss for Republicans eight months from the midterm elections.\n\nMeanwhile, even Republicans privately concede that Democratic nominee Connor Lamb \u2014 a charismatic, young former Marine and prosecutor \u2014 is the superior recruit. He's brought in far more money than the GOP candidate in this traditionally solidly red district near Pittsburgh. Lamb has raised $3 million in the race, while Democratic outside groups stayed mostly on the sidelines. They have put in only about $1.7 million, allowing Lamb to run a more independent race.\n\nLamb has cut a moderate profile with a populist tinge. He has said he would oppose Nancy Pelosi as Democratic leader and has also wooed steel workers, coal miners and union activists in this blue-collar districts. He's had a somewhat similar economic message to Trump when he campaigned and won here.\n\nThis special election was triggered by the resignation of former Rep. Tim Murphy, who stepped down after it was revealed that the anti-abortion rights congressman had an extramarital affair and pressured his mistress to terminate a possible pregnancy.\n\nDue to court-ordered redistricting, the district as it's drawn now will cease to exist come Election Day 2018, and neither Saccone nor Lamb will even live in the rejiggered seat. So the fact that Republicans are spending so heavily to save what's essentially a phantom district underscores what is on the line: They don't want a loss in such a GOP stronghold to spur even more panic among their ranks that Trump is dragging them down.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats are salivating for an upset that will further galvanize their energetic base hoping for a blue wave in November. To this point, since Trump has been president, Republicans have underperformed in GOP-held House special elections, but still won all five of them.\n\nPolls close at 8 p.m. ET. Here are four questions to ponder in the meantime:\n\n1. Will this be a canary in the coal mine for the GOP?\n\nA few months ago, when a rash of retirements seemed like the latest alarm bells for Republicans, GOP strategists urged caution. Some pointed to this Pennsylvania race \u2014 where Saccone was still heavily favored \u2014 as the possible canary in the coal mine to watch for Republicans. This race, they said, could be a much bigger sign of danger ahead for the GOP.\n\nIf Lamb does win on Tuesday night, it could send even more GOP members of Congress heading for the exits, adding to what's already a record number of retirements.\n\nThe ominous signs have been there for some time for Republicans. Since Trump's election, 39 state legislative races have flipped from red to blue. Democrats notched big wins last November in both the Virginia and New Jersey governor's races.\n\nAnd special House elections last year across the board showed a major shift toward Democrats, even if they didn't notch a victory in a GOP-held race yet. Republicans have far underperformed in special elections in Kansas, Montana and South Carolina \u2014 all solidly GOP territory.\n\nDemocrats did score a major upset in December in the Alabama Senate race, flipping a seat in a state that Trump carried by nearly 30 points. In that contest, Republicans were running a deeply flawed candidate in GOP nominee Roy Moore, long a controversial figure in state Republican circles. Several women accused him of sexual misconduct and pursuing them romantically when they were teenagers, and he was much older.\n\nRepublicans are already trying to paint Saccone as a weak candidate, but blaming him for underperforming is hardly a credible excuse in such a Republican area. It would instead be a sure sign of danger ahead, at least in the narrative that would form about 2018, what it would mean for GOP morale, fundraising and the power of the president to help candidates over the line.\n\nNo race is a perfect predictor, and Republicans will also surely note that before their own massive wave in 2010 that helped them capture control of the House, there was another Pennsylvania special election that went Democrats' way. That race certainly was no sign of their fortunes come November.\n\nStill, there's been more than enough evidence in the 16 months since Trump was elected that the energy on the Democratic side is very real. Now, a Lamb win would mean that even areas that were once considered safe GOP territory might no longer be.\n\nTrump rode into town Saturday night in nearby Moon Township to campaign for Saccone. He had a trademark wild and unpredictable rally to help Saccone. He boasted that he was able to help save the Georgia special election in a similar fashion and later tweeted about it:\n\nThe president even gave the Democratic nominee his own Trump-branded nickname, \"Lamb the sham.\" He made the case for Saccone, who has run as an unabashedly pro-Trump candidate, before turning to a myriad other topics and insults.\n\nIt was all classic Trump \u2014 eager to claim credit despite scant evidence he helped move many poll numbers, as in Georgia. He didn't mention other places where he's gone in and lost \u2014 like Alabama, where he first backed the losing primary candidate and then failed to get Moore across the finish line.\n\nFor Trump, every day is Nov. 8, 2016. He revels in reliving that historic night and boasting of his unexpected victory over Hillary Clinton. But now Tuesday night could show if Trump's winning coalition is transferable to other candidates \u2014 or not.\n\nDemocrats faced a similar problem under President Obama. As NPR's Domenico Montanaro calculated, when Obama was on the ballot, Democrats gained 31 seats in the House and nine in the Senate. When he wasn't, the party lost 82 seats in the House and 17 in the Senate.\n\nObama's popularity dropped during his tenure, and he was, indeed, a drag on his own party in 2010 after the Affordable Care Act passed. But Obama's numbers were stronger than Trump's, and there wasn't the constant chaos and scandal plaguing the White House.\n\nUltimately, Trump's unpopularity, remains the biggest detriment for Republicans in the midterms. It raises the question of how Trump could be \u2014 or is willing to not be \u2014 dispatched on behalf of Republicans on the trail over the coming months. That will be even more acute if Saccone loses. Even in places like the Rust Belt where he was once seen as an asset may not be a given any longer.\n\nWhile Trump doesn't like to be associated with anything losing, he also never passes up a chance to get before a crowd. So while he may salivate at campaigning more, it could be hard for anyone in the GOP to make the case to the president he would hurt more than help.\n\nRepublicans have already been trying to downplay expectations ahead of a loss too, with Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Val DiGiorgio making the stunning argument on Fox News Monday that \"this is a Democrat district\" despite Trump's heavy win \u2014 even though past GOP presidential nominees also performed similarly and Murphy routinely won re-election easily, or even went unopposed. A Democrats hasn't won here in 15 years.\n\n3. Can the economy and tax bill save Republicans \u2014 or not?\n\nThe silver bullet for Republicans in the midterms could be the positive economy \u2014 and the GOP tax cuts they passed last year that are growing in popularity.\n\nYet that argument wasn't used much in the final stretch to help Saccone in Pennsylvania. Early ads touted economic growth and the tax overhaul, while hitting Lamb for downplaying the impact of the tax cuts. But in the final stretch, that message was abandoned for much more ominous ads hammering Lamb over immigration and crime.\n\nThat was the same dark turn Republicans took in Virginia last fall \u2014 a gambit that failed. So if that's their closing message, it's a sign that the political boon they hoped to gain from an economic boom might not be working. And, as much as Democrats haven't figured out messaging on the tax bill, Republicans may not have either.\n\nOne of the unknowns is how the recently announced tariffs could affect the race. Areas like the 18th district, where blue-collar Democrats crossed party lines to vote for Trump, have been hard hit in an age of globalization. Trump's imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum would seem to be tailor-made to boost political support in economically distressed areas like this.\n\nHowever, a Monmouth University poll (taken before Trump's visit), which showed Lamb with a narrow lead \u2014 both under regular- and high-turnout scenarios \u2014 found the tariff announcement didn't seem to sway voters at all. Plus, both Saccone and Lamb have been supportive of the tariffs.\n\nLamb has run a more centrist campaign and underscored local issues. That has helped him close the gap and win crossover Republicans. But this race is also a test of whether Democrats can blunt what has been one of Republicans' most effective weapons \u2014 Nancy Pelosi.\n\nLamb has run ads boasting of how he would oppose Pelosi as Democrats' House leader \u2014 or even speaker \u2014 if he's elected, echoing pushes by like-minded legislators such as Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan and Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton in calling for new leadership. And the surrogates he's had campaign for him, like former Vice President Joe Biden, have a much different appeal to voters in this area than the San Franciscan could.\n\nNevertheless, Republicans have been repeatedly able to turn Pelosi into a political bogeyman, dragging down surging candidates by tying her to them. It was a strategy they first employed successfully in 2010 \u2014 and replicated it.

Otis is a former federal prosecutor in Virginia, special counsel to former President George H.W. Bush and an adviser at the Drug Enforcement Administration. He currently serves as an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nBut it's his years-long record of public comments and Internet posts on crime and drugs that have drawn fire from civil rights groups and prisoner advocates this week.\n\nIn 2013, for instance, Otis commented on a popular legal blog that \"it is precisely because race and criminality have no causative relationship that our side cannot be cowed when the other side starts bellowing about racial disparities in imprisonment, and then claiming they are caused by racism. They are not caused by racism, and as you quite correctly say, they are not caused by race. They are caused by making choices.\"\n\nOtis continued that the main social factor is a \"stable, disciplined, employed, two-parent family life.\" And, he wrote, \"this is the reason that, for example, Orientals have less incidence of crime than whites. ... The reason Orientals stay out of jail more than either whites or blacks is that family life, work, education and tradition are honored more in Oriental culture than in ours.\"\n\nIn another post, on his Crime and Consequences blog, Otis wrote: \"When Fifth Circuit Judge Edith Jones said at a University of Pennsylvania Law School talk that blacks and Hispanics are more violent than whites, a consortium of civil rights organizations filed a complaint. The complaint calls for stern discipline, on the grounds that the remarks were 'discriminatory and biased.' \"\n\nHe added: \"So far as I have been able to discover, it makes no mention of the fact that they're true.\"\n\nOtis is well-known in the community of people who closely follow criminal sentencing. He's long been in favor of stiff mandatory punishments for drug crimes, testifying in Congress and talking with reporters, including NPR.\n\nLast year, he told Morning Edition, \"What people don't realize as much as they should is that a courier in the drug business is just as essential as a car is in a pizza delivery business. The business \u2014 unless you can deliver your inventory, the business is going to fall apart.\"\n\nHe's held firm to those views even as an unusual bipartisan coalition has been working to push Congress to make punishments more lenient for low-level drug offenders. Among the people who share Otis' approach is the current attorney general, Jeff Sessions.\n\nWhile lawmakers have failed to pass sweeping measures to reduce mandatory minimum prison terms, the U.S. Sentencing Commission, the body for which Otis has been nominated, moved in 2014 to pave the way to release thousands of drug offenders.\n\nWord of the Otis nomination prompted outcry from groups that have been working to overhaul the criminal justice system, particularly for people convicted of drug offenses.\n\nFamilies Against Mandatory Minimums, a nonprofit group that works for inmates and their families, had never before taken a formal position on a nominee for the Sentencing Commission \u2014 until the Otis pick.\n\n\"Mr. Otis's outdated views are well-known and well-documented,\" said FAMM president Kevin Ring. \"This is not a person who will be guided by evidence and data.

After a couple of important cases nearly a decade ago, the court has, for the most part, turned away cases challenging gun laws.\n\nSo why the reluctance, what's the history and is the right to bear arms an absolute one?\n\nFrom a \"fraud\" on the American public to an individual right\n\nFor most of American legal history, the consensus was that the right to bear arms was not an individual right, but rather a right for those called to military service, the militia.\n\nFormer Chief Justice Warren Burger, a conservative, said the idea that there was an individual right to bear arms was \"a fraud.\" If he were writing the Bill of Rights now, he said in 1991, \"There wouldn't be any such thing as the Second Amendment.\"\n\nHe declared on PBS that the Second Amendment \"has been the subject of one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word fraud, on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.\"\n\nBut that all changed with some scholarly work and cases brought by gun-rights advocates.\n\nIn 2008, in District of Columbia v. Heller, the court said there is an individual constitutional right to have a handgun in one's home for self-protection. Two years later, in a second case, the court made clear that its decision applied to the states, as well as the federal government.\n\nNot an absolute right\n\nThe court has never said, however, that the right to bear arms in this country is absolute.\n\nIn declaring an individual right to bear arms, the court made clear that there are limitations on that right, just as there are limitations on other constitutional rights.\n\nThere is a First Amendment right to free speech, but someone can't yell \"fire!\" in a crowded theater. And a person can't parade loudly through a residential area at 2 a.m. either.\n\nSimilarly, the court said in 2008 that the right to bear arms doesn't bar the government from regulating firearms.\n\nThe justices specifically said the government can ban firearms for felons or the mentally ill; it can ban guns in sensitive places, like schools and government buildings; and the government can impose conditions and qualifications for the commercial sale of guns.\n\nIn addition, the court also seemed to say that \"particularly dangerous and unusual weapons,\" such as military-style assault weapons, could be prohibited.\n\nThe court has certainly had the opportunity to say more on guns in recent years. But it's turned away numerous gun cases since Heller.\n\nJust last month, for example, the court refused to hear a case testing California's 10-day waiting period to buy a gun. Justice Clarence Thomas was the only dissenter, and he accused the court of turning the right to bear arms into a \"disfavored\" constitutional right.\n\nLast June, he and Trump-appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch dissented when the court refused to hear a challenge to a general ban on concealed carry weapons outside the home.\n\nAnd in the years before that, the court refused to hear challenges to bans on assault weapons, bans on weapons for someone who is the subject of a protection order in a domestic dispute, and more.\n\nThere are two cases the court ruled on recently. One was to uphold a law banning a gun for anyone convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Justice Thomas dissented from that one, as did Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in part.\n\nIn 2014, the court, by a 5-to-4 vote upheld a strict ban on the straw purchase of firearms \u2014that is, if, for instance, someone has a record of domestic violence and wouldn't be allowed to buy a gun, but a family member or friend buys one for that person.\n\nAnd there's no indication the court is anxious to take up more gun cases any time soon. There are two possible explanations for this continued refusal to act \u2014 (1) That the court believes it laid down guidelines in its 2008 Heller decision, and would just as soon stay out of this, and (2) More likely, neither side \u2014 those justices who believe that the Constitution allows strict gun laws or those who think that such gun control laws are unconstitutional \u2014 is sure they have the votes to prevail if the court takes up these issues.\n\nAfter all, Heller was 5-to-4, with Justice Anthony Kennedy the deciding vote. And it has long been assumed that the caveats in the decision were the price of his vote.\n\nThere is, of course, a third possible explanation for the failure to take up gun cases: that some justices, especially in light of current circumstances, have evolving views on this subject.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Domenico Montanaro", "body": "President Trump certainly has a flair for the dramatic.\n\nThe announcement Thursday night that the president of the United States had accepted an invitation to meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un shocked the world.\n\nThat's the kind of phrase that's overused \u2014 in politics and sports in particular \u2014 but it's appropriate in this case.\n\n\"This is quite extraordinary,\" former U.S. Ambassador Chris Hill told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly on All Things Considered Thursday night. Hill represented the U.S. in multilateral talks with North Korea during the George W. Bush  because no other sitting U.S. presidents has met with a North Korean leader. (Jimmy Carter met with then-North Korean leader Kim Il Sung in 1994 as a former president, and former President Bill Clinton traveled to North Korea and met with Kim Jong Il in 2009 to negotiate the release of two journalists.)\n\nExtraordinary because the rhetoric between the countries has been heated in recent months with President Trump referring to Kim as \"Little Rocket Man\" and a \"madman,\" and Kim referring to Trump as a \"lunatic\" and \"loser.\"\n\nExtraordinary because few realistically thought this could happen. Trump has said in the past he would be open to meeting with Kim, but on Tuesday when asked about the possibility, he was noncommittal. \"We're going to see what happens,\" he said.\n\nThe surprise nature of the announcement gave the impression of an ad hoc gambit rather than a careful, well-thought out approach to dealing with an unpredictable nuclear regime.\n\nIn diplomacy, it comes with incredible risk to subject a principal to a one-on-one meeting where results aren't guaranteed \u2014 or at least close. Typically, spade work is done by lower-level experts for months, if not years.\n\nTrump is banking on the power of his personality for a breakthrough. But some recent domestic examples provide little evidence Trump will deal with this particularly thorny issue masterfully.\n\nAfter Trump's televised meetings on immigration and guns, participants were left confused. Instead of command performances, there was disorganization and a lack of policy depth.\n\nWhat's more, the Trump administration's stance on North Korea has been something of a whiplash. Washington, with Trump's backing, has pushed for ramping up sanctions against Pyongyang. And the White House reportedly scoffed at the State Department's special envoy who tried to pursue direct talks late last year.\n\n\"He's such a dreamer,\" one White House official told Reuters sarcastically of State's point man on North Korea, Joseph Yun.\n\nSeemingly out of frustration with a lack of effort at pursuing direct diplomacy and a peaceful solution, Yun retired \u2014 just last week.\n\nWhen it comes to an issue as dangerous and delicate as North Korea, this isn't how it's normally done. At the same time, Trump's theory of everything is that the way it's always been done hasn't worked, so let's try something else.\n\nThat high-risk, high-reward approach has its skeptics, but not everyone is dismissing it out of hand.\n\n\"We were quickly heading down the road to a possible military confrontation with the North Koreans and a major step towards diplomacy is a most welcome turn of events,\" Suzanne DiMaggio, senior fellow at the think tank New America, said on NPR's Morning Edition Friday.\n\nHill, the former U.S. negotiator on North Korea, said Trump's out-of-the-box stance may very well have been what spurred this.\n\n\"Frankly, he may be right about some of this, because it was pretty clear that the U.S. was kind of going relentlessly on this issue,\" Hill said on All Things Considered. \"And he's such a \u2014 how to put it \u2014 different kind of president that \u2014 he seemed to be prepared to talk about things that other presidents have not been prepared to talk about.\n\n\"For example, in Washington the last few weeks, there's been a discussion about the so-called bloody nose and the idea that somehow we could launch some kind of strike against the North Koreans,\" he added. \"So it could be that this kind of attitude unconstrained by what anyone in the past has done kind of gave the North Koreans pause.\"\n\nDiMaggio and others said preparation and expectations-setting are going to prove important. In particular, the president should stop raising the bar for the possibility that the North will give up its nuclear program entirely, like the White House and the president did Thursday.\n\n\"We look forward to the denuclearization of North Korea,\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. \"In the meantime, all sanctions and maximum pressure must remain.\"\n\nThe president then tweeted that Kim \"talked about denuclearization ... not just a freeze.\"\n\n\"We need to go into the mindset that this is going to be a long, arduous process,\" DiMaggio said. \"The North Koreans are not going to give up their nuclear program anytime soon. They may well never give it up. ... We need to really get in place the priorities that we want to achieve in the near term.\"\n\nBut the expectations horse may have already left the barn. Here was Colorado Republican Sen. Cory Gardner on NPR's Morning Edition: \"If the president of the United States meets with Kim Jong Un and does not walk away with what should be those concrete steps towards denuclearization, then I don't see how it's any closer to the kind of peace on the peninsula that we have been seeking.\"\n\nHill cautioned against that mindset, saying there need to be other attainable goals on the table. \"It's important to get down all the steps with the last one being complete denuclearization,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think we're going to get an absolute goal of denuclearization,\" Bill Richardson, a Democrat and former ambassador who has been to North Korea eight times, said on CNN Friday. \"I think the president needs to temper that.\"\n\n\"Risks need to be mitigated by very good staff work\"\n\nPreparation is key, experts agree, but the staffing situation in the White House and at the State Department makes observers nervous.\n\n\"What's important,\" Hill said, \"is the U.S. has some clear understanding of what goes forward, because a presidential meeting is kind of coin of the realm, and the idea that we are just going to have a pause in their testing without really concrete understandings of what goes forward \u2014 that's risky, and those risks need to be mitigated by very good staff work.\"\n\nWhen it comes to that staff work, there are some danger signs. Diplomatic experts have been sidelined in this administration. As NPR diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen points out, there is a thin bench at the State Department currently when it comes to dealing with North Korea \u2014 not only did Yun retire, someone who joined the foreign service in 1985, but there is also no assistant secretary of state for East Asia (she's currently going through her confirmation process). Trump still hasn't nominated an ambassador to South Korea.\n\nA career diplomat is currently serving in that role, which can be a good thing, but all of it points to unsteadiness and inconsistency at the staff level, and in talks with a rogue regime, one false move can have massive ripple effects and unintended consequences.\n\nWhat's more, when the announcement came down, it was the deputy secretary of state at the White House, not Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. He is currently in Africa. He said this was not a \"surprise,\" but he also signaled that Trump made the decision on his own.\n\nThis was \"a decision the President took himself,\" Tillerson said, per CNN, in Djibouti, a day after Tillerson questioned \"whether conditions are right\" for negotiations.\n\n\"We're a long way from negotiations,\" Tillerson said in Ethiopia Thursday. \"We just need to be very clear-eyed and realistic about it. I don't know yet, until we are able to meet ourselves face to face with representatives of North Korea, whether the conditions are right to even begin thinking about negotiations.\"\n\nOn Friday, though, Tillerson was put in the position of trying to walk a very fine line between the words negotiations \u2013 and talks.\n\n\"With respect to talks with North Korea versus negotiations,\" he said, \"and I think this seems to be something that people continue to struggle with the difference \u2014 my comments have been that the conditions are not right for negotiations.\"\n\nCan Trump stick to the script?\n\nEither way, talks or negotiations with North Korea are high stakes, especially when the president is involved. And this president, in particular, has had trouble sticking to the script.\n\n\"His primary problem is sticking to talking points and really laying the kind of groundwork that has to be laid for the kind of serious negotiations that are going to take place,\" former Obama Defense Secretary and CIA Director Leon Panetta told CNN.\n\n\"It's risky,\" Richardson said. \"We've got to be properly prepared, and we cannot underestimate Kim Jong Un. He's evolving into a strategic thinker, into a man with an end game.\"\n\nTo that point, congressional Republicans are sharpening their sabers.\n\n\"I do believe that North Korea now believes President Trump will use military force if he has to,\" South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said in a statement. \"A word of warning to North Korean President Kim Jong Un \u2014 the worst possible thing you can do is meet with President Trump in person and try to play him. If you do that, it will be the end of you \u2014 and your regime.\"\n\nStill, while Trump agreeing to a meeting surprised almost everyone and didn't relieve skepticism, experts welcomed the news.\n\n\"This is a positive step,\" Panetta said. \"The world is breathing a sigh of relief as a result of having these negotiations, even having this kind of meeting.\"\n\nBut they warned about something else: \"One of the first priorities is going to have to be how to soundproof this process from President Trump's tweets and rants,\" DiMaggio said, \"otherwise we are going to be in for a rocky road ahead.\"\n\nOr, as Richardson put it: \"I think this is big stakes, a big gamble, but I'm supporting the president's effort to do it.

A year into office, Trump's approval ratings are at record-low levels, and a majority of Americans see his first year as a failure.\n\nA scripted speech like the State of the Union, with dedicated air time, gives Trump a prime opportunity to lay out his agenda and try to set a new tone.\n\nThe theme of the speech will be \"building a safe, strong and proud America,\" a senior administration official told reporters, and the president will tout his \"record-setting\" accomplishments, which are \"lifting all Americans.\" The speech will reflect on his first year in office and highlight the country's economic upswing.\n\nThe official said the speech will be forward-looking and optimistic, much in the vein of Trump's first address to Congress in February 2017, shortly after he was inaugurated, when he called for the \"renewal of the American spirit.\"\n\nTuesday night, Trump is expected to focus on five major policy areas: jobs and the economy, infrastructure, immigration, trade and national security. The president is expected to unveil some new policy proposals, though the official would not elaborate on what those would be.\n\nThe economy will be a major facet of Trump's look back. The president will tout the tax law passed in December by Congress, his administration's deregulation efforts and stock market gains.\n\nIn the NPR poll, 45 percent of Americans said the economy has improved under Trump, who inherited an upward economic trajectory from former President Barack Obama. The economy didn't grow as quickly in the final quarter of 2017 as many economists had projected, though.\n\nStill, the economy is one mark that can work in the president's favor, and Republicans \u2014 especially heading into the 2018 midterms \u2014 hope that bonuses and higher paychecks resulting from the tax law will help boost voters come November.\n\nOn infrastructure, the president will outline his $1 trillion plan to rebuild the country's roads, bridges and more \u2014 something he has long hoped to champion in Congress. Such an effort could draw bipartisan support, but has so far lacked specifics.\n\nImmigration will also be a critical component, with the White House proposing to offer protections for people in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA, which is set to expire March 5. Under the plan outlined to congressional Republicans this week, the White House would support a 10- to 12-year path to citizenship for the roughly 700,000 undocumented immigrants currently enrolled in DACA who came to the country as children. The proposal would also offer that path to others who were eligible for DACA but not currently enrolled, which could be up to 1.8 million people in total.\n\nThe White House also wants $25 billion for Trump's proposed Southern border wall and other border security measures, along with an end to the visa lottery system and changes to policies by which immigrants legally in the U.S. are allowed to sponsor extended family members.\n\nThose cuts to legal immigration in exchange for a DACA deal have been a nonstarter with many Democrats. At the same time, many in the president's conservative base are upset that he would offer any path to citizenship for DACA recipients and the broader group of immigrants known as DREAMers.\n\nTrump will also talk about trade, which has been a key part of his populist platform and a theme of past speeches, including recently at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. On Friday, Trump defended his \"America First\" approach to trade, saying that while the U.S. supports free trade, \"it needs to be fair and it needs to be reciprocal.\"\n\nTrump pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal when he came to the White House. His administration is also working on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement; Trump has, at times, suggested leaving NAFTA altogether.\n\nThe president is expected to touch on themes similar to his Davos speech and to the remarks he gave last November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit, where he said, \"The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to violations, cheating, or economic aggression. Those days are over.\"\n\nThe final key part of Trump's speech will focus on national security, including efforts to rebuild the military and deal with foreign threats such as ISIS \u2014 another effort where he's received positive marks from Americans \u2014 North Korea and others. On North Korea, Trump has a record of using controversial rhetoric, including taunting North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un as \"Little Rocket Man\" and comparing the size of the countries' \"nuclear buttons.\"\n\nHistorically, few promises that presidents lay out in these speeches ever get implemented, as PBS NewsHour noted in 2015. The speeches rarely change anyone's minds, either, Gallup reported in 2010: \"Audiences for the State of the Union tend to be heavily tilted toward the president's existing supporters.\"\n\nAnd while Trump will have an unfiltered platform to lay out his agenda, any proposals or promises to reach across the aisle could be undone by a tonal pivot in a Tweet or in unscripted remarks.\n\nJust days after last year's call for unity before a joint session of Congress, for example, Trump tweeted \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 that Obama had wiretapped his home in Trump Tower.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Adrienne St. Clair", "body": "Native American leaders are once again pushing for a seat at the decision-making table, saying this week that tribal nations have been overlooked for \"too often and too long.\"\n\nTheir latest concern comes with President Trump's proposed infrastructure plan. The president sent it to Congress on Monday, saying he aimed \"to help build a better future for all Americans.\"\n\nThat same day, President Jefferson Keel of the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) told the annual gathering of tribal leaders that, \"in 2018, no infrastructure bill should pass unless it includes Indian Country's priorities.\"\n\nTrump urged Congress to act quickly on an infrastructure bill that would stimulate the economy, shorten the process to approve building projects and address continuing infrastructure needs in rural areas. The proposed bill would also give more power to state and local authorities and provide training for the younger American workforce.\n\nTrump's proposal reiterates points he outlined in the State of the Union last month, when he described America as \"a nation of builders.\"\n\nKeel used a similar phrase in his State of the Indian Nations address on Monday.\n\n\"Native peoples are also builders and managers of roads and bridges and other essential infrastructure,\" he said.\n\nKeel said that a 2018 infrastructure bill should ensure that all communities \u2014 including native communities \u2014 have the framework needed to succeed. He emphasized that Congress should give tribes the same opportunities that state and local governments have to raise money, invest sufficient funding in basic building needs, remove barriers for tribes to make decisions and support tribal right to consent to developments that affect tribes and tribal lands.\n\n\"We just want to be included\"\n\nIn terms of infrastructure, Trump's latest demands to Congress and Keel's priorities in Indian Country align. Both recognize the need for investing, empowering local authorities and addressing a flawed regulatory system that creates barriers for building. But Keel and others want to make sure that Indian Country is considered part of the bigger picture.\n\n\"If there is going to be any investment in infrastructure, I think we as a country should invest in the areas where it is most needed,\" Russell Begaye, president of the Navajo Nation, wrote in an email to NPR. \"It shouldn't matter if the area is a rural Native American area or not.\"\n\nKeel is on board with the president's proposal.\n\n\"It's not that we disagree with his priorities,\" Keel told NPR on Thursday. \"We just want to be included in any of those plans for development of plans or policies that affect Indian Country in a way that we can not only protect our lands, but we can improve the relationship.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's plan would allocate $200 billion in federal money over 10 years, with additional contributions from states, localities and private investors that it claims would generate $1.5 trillion to fix and upgrade U.S. infrastructure, such as railroads, airports and highways. It would also shorten the project approval process down to two years or less, but Keel and other tribal leaders wonder whether Trump considered native lands when creating his new infrastructure proposal.\n\n\"To be honest, I don't know, but I hope \u2014 and Indian Country is hopeful \u2014 that we will be included in any of those plans or visions for fixing the infrastructure of this country,\" Keel said.\n\nRussell Begaye, president of the Navajo Nation, said that while Trump's plan is a start and the Navajo Nation supports the rural infrastructure program, \"we need to beef it up and apply the funding where it is needed \u2014 and it's needed on tribal reservations like ours.\"\n\nHints to the Trump administration's funding priorities for tribes may be hidden in the 2019 budget released this week, which included significant cuts to federal programs that serve Indian Country. The proposed budget includes a 15 percent cut to the Bureau of Indian Affairs and other major reductions that range from human services programs to law enforcement to education.\n\nHowever, Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke said Tuesday at NCAI's Executive Winter Council, that the president's infrastructure plan does include a complete reorganization of the bureaucratic processes and regulations, including those within native lands.\n\nHe also said he wants to make it easier to build a bridge \u2014 literally. Under the current process, it can take places up to 10 years to get permission to build a bridge, Zinke said. In Indian territory, increased regulations make the approval process take even longer.\n\nZinke, who helped create the new plan, admitted that the government has fallen short when it comes to serving the 573 federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native tribes.\n\n\"I want you to trust the government,\" he said. \"But in many cases, that trust has been breached.\"\n\nSpeaking to the full ballroom of tribal leaders, Zinke called himself a \"champion of all Indian Nations,\" though some of his decisions in his first year to slash the size of National Parks and approve controversial use of federal lands have made him another controversial figure in the Trump cabinet.\n\nWhile Keel said he has great regard for Zinke, he's concerned that the secretary's talk of reorganization could affect relationships tribes have with state and local governments and other tribes, what it will cost, and the fact that there has been no consultation with tribal governments.\n\n\"It's typical in the sense of the federal government saying, 'here's the plan, this is what we're going to do, how do you like it?'

Pompeo: What Trump's Cabinet Shakeup Might Mean\n\nShortly after announcing a major shakeup on Twitter Tuesday, President Trump told reporters, \"We're getting very close to having the Cabinet and other things that I want.\"\n\nTrump wished outgoing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson well, but said he expects a more simpatico relationship with Mike Pompeo, the current CIA director whom the president has tapped to be the nation's top diplomat.\n\n\"We're always on the same wavelength,\" Trump said of Pompeo, whose confirmation hearing is expected in April. \"We have a very similar thought process.\"\n\nA White House official said Trump was eager to make the switch in advance of upcoming talks with North Korea and ongoing trade negotiations. Here are some areas where the change could make a difference:\n\nTillerson was caught flat-footed last week when Trump abruptly accepted an invitation for face-to-face talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Tillerson, who was traveling in Africa, had told reporters just a day earlier that the U.S. was \"a long ways from negotiations\" with Pyongyang.\n\nTrump acknowledged he hadn't discussed the idea in advance with Tillerson. \"Rex wasn't, as you know, in this country,\" Trump told reporters on Tuesday. \"I made that decision by myself.\"\n\nPompeo defended the president's move but stressed the U.S. and its allies will continue to press North Korea in advance of any Trump-Kim summit.\n\n\"This administration has its eyes wide open and the whole time this conversation takes place, the pressure will continue to mount on North Korea,\" Pompeo told CBS. \"There is no relief in sight until the president gets the objective that he has set forth consistently during his entire time in office.\"\n\nThat objective is denuclearization. According to South Korean officials who met with Kim, the North Korean leader expressed a willingness to discuss it, though it's not clear exactly what that means.\n\nTrump has threatened to tear up the Iran nuclear deal, negotiated by the Obama administration and five other countries, although so far he has stopped short of doing so. The deal gives Iran relief from certain international economic sanctions in exchange for suspension of its outlaw nuclear program. Tillerson and other national security advisers urged the president to move carefully in overturning the deal, arguing that despite Iran's other transgressions, the nuclear agreement is working.\n\nThis was one of the key differences Trump cited in explaining Tillerson's dismissal.\n\n\"We disagreed on things,\" Trump said Tuesday. \"When you look at the Iran deal, I think it's terrible. I guess he thought it was OK. I wanted to either break it or do something, and he felt a little bit differently.\"\n\nPompeo, like the president, has been a fierce critic of the Iran deal, saying it doesn't go far enough in dismantling Tehran's nuclear program and that it's not permanent.\n\n\"President Trump is determined to prevent that from happening in North Korea,\" Pompeo told CBS. Trump's reluctance to live by the terms of the Iran agreement, however, may affect U.S. credibility in negotiations with Pyongyang.\n\nTillerson's ouster comes just days after Trump fired the opening salvo in what critics warn could become a trade war. The former Exxon Mobil CEO was among the advisers who reportedly tried unsuccessfully to stop the president from ordering steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.\n\nPompeo defended the president in an interview with Fox News Sunday, especially with regard to China, which is widely blamed for the glut of steel and aluminum on the world market.\n\n\"It was very clear that what the Chinese are doing, whether that'd be on trade or the theft of intellectual property or their continued advancement in East and South China Seas, this administration is prepared and engaged in pushing back against the Chinese threats so that we can have a good relationship with China in a way the world desperately needs,\" Pompeo said.\n\nTrump told reporters Tuesday that he wished Tillerson well but conceded he and the former secretary of state often didn't see eye to eye. The president regularly undercut Tillerson, once tweeting that he was \"wasting his time\" in pursuing a diplomatic approach to North Korea.\n\nTillerson, in turn, made little effort to hide his disdain for the president. He pointedly did not deny an NBC report last October that he'd once called Trump a \"moron.\"\n\nPompeo, who often delivers the president's intelligence briefing in person, enjoys a better relationship with Trump.\n\n\"For whatever reason, chemistry, whatever it is,\" Trump told reporters. \"Right from the beginning, from day one, I've gotten along well with Mike Pompeo.\"\n\nFormer CIA Director Michael Hayden suggests that Trump and Pompeo share a similar worldview, which has pluses and minuses.\n\n\"I think having a secretary of state who's more compatible with the president, who sounds and thinks more like the president, will actually make some things easier for the administration,\" Hayden told Morning Edition on Tuesday. \"On the other hand, Secretary Tillerson was a counterweight to some of the instantaneous, spontaneous, instinctive decisions that the president was prone to make. And I think we're going to miss the counterweight.\"", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "", "body": "Portraits Of Ex-President Obama And Former First Lady Unveiled\n\nThe portraits of Barack Obama and Michelle Obama were revealed at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.

And even if people do have the money, it's hard to actually find enough cash to buy the goods.\n\n\"People don't have bolivares to spend, that's why we have created bills of two denominations,\" Mayor Solfreddy Sol\u00f3rzano told the BBC.\n\nElorza has a festival that starts Monday, according to the broadcaster, and local authorities and businessmen were worried that the cash crunch would cause the city to lose business.\n\n\"Now those who want to buy just a sweet or even a whole cow from the barbecue, will be able to do so,\" cattle breeder Canuto Garcia told the BBC.\n\nThe mayor's office is selling the local currency at an 8 percent commission, according to Reuters, which can be purchased with bolivars using a card or bank transfer. \"People will be able to return the tickets to the mayor's office and claim a bolivar-denominated refund,\" the wire service adds.\n\nThis isn't the first local currency to launch in Venezuela recently. As Venezuela's El Nacional newspaper reports, economist Jose Guerra says that the hyperinflation is causing what he termed \"mini central banks\" to emerge.\n\nLast December, one neighborhood of the capital Caracas started issuing an alternative currency, which it called the panal. As The Associated Press reported, that currency could only be used in a few stores and was meant to help the struggling area buy basic staples such as rice.\n\nAt the time, opposition politician Jose Guerra expressed concern that multiple currencies in the country could further deepen the crisis by creating \"monetary chaos,\" the AP added.\n\nLast month, President Nicolas Maduro also proposed a state-sponsored cryptocurrency to ease the cash crunch.\n\nReporter John Otis told Morning Edition that each unit of the currency would be backed by one barrel of oil. The president has touted the currency as a new innovation, Otis reports, though it has been met with skepticism by some critics who note that the oil that is \"backing\" the currency has not actually been taken out of the ground yet.\n\nOn Monday, the White House imposed new sanctions on Venezuelan cryptocurrency. The executive order prohibits transactions by U.S. citizens using \"any digital currency, digital coin, or digital token,\" issued by Venezuela's government since January.\n\nAs Reuters reports, Maduro's government \"blames the country's crisis on an 'economic war' being waged by Washington and the opposition, aimed at toppling his government.\"\n\nBut critics say strict currency controls are a major factor contributing to the crisis.

The memo didn't even break much news \u2014 comments by members of Congress and reports in the press ended up setting the stage for it nicely.\n\nBut, that doesn't mean it didn't have some points of interest, including these five takeaways.\n\nNPR and other news organizations have not detailed the infamous, unverified dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele because its allegations about President Trump and Russia are unproven. That's why allies of Trump in Congress have sought to make the case that it's the germ of the whole Russia matter.\n\nBy drawing attention to its salaciousness and the prospect that it could be the product of Russian intelligence disinformation, they have sought to argue: If it's the sum total of the case for alleged collusion with the Russians or an alleged conspiracy between the Trump 2016 campaign and agents of the Kremlin, there is no case here.\n\nBut, it's not the sum total of the alleged conspiracy/collusion case.\n\nAnd in fact, the memo prepared by Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, says that what \"triggered\" the FBI's investigation was evidence about onetime Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos. He has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians.\n\nAccording to court documents, Papadopoulos was offered dirt on Hillary Clinton and high-level meetings with Russians early in the campaign. When that story \u2014 after a drunken night out at the pub \u2014 got back to Washington, D.C., the FBI opened its investigation. So it was already underway by the time the Steele dossier materialized.\n\nCarter Page, like George Papadopoulos, was a junior foreign policy adviser to the Trump 2016 campaign. He visited Russia at least twice in 2016 and acknowledged in an earlier interview with the House Intelligence Committee that he'd met with government officials and others there. The core of the memo is that the FBI and the Justice Department used unverified material in the Steele dossier to ask the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to authorize surveillance of Page.\n\nRepublicans say that's the real problem here \u2014 in their telling, biased investigators didn't tell the court the dossier material was unproven political opposition research that had been funded by Democrats. But the memo doesn't say whether there might have been other evidence beyond the dossier \u2014 foreign intelligence intercepts or reporting from human sources \u2014 that also supported the warrant request. (And Friday night the Washington Post reported that the FISA court \"was aware that some of the information underpinning the warrant request was paid for by a political entity, although the application did not specifically name the Democratic National Committee or the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign,\" according to two U.S. officials.)\n\nThe Nunes memo also doesn't say that the FISA court requires that a warrant produce intelligence in order to reauthorize it. So, however the FBI got its initial warrant for Page, the Nunes memo suggests that once surveillance of Page started, it continued producing foreign intelligence.\n\nOfficials from FBI Director James Comey in 2016 to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein \u2014 who was appointed by Trump and serves today in the Trump administration \u2014 have signed successive applications for warrants, the memo says.\n\nThe former British intelligence officer and dossier author Christopher Steele has remained a silent cipher in the middle of the Russia imbroglio. He hasn't been heard from publicly since his document exploded onto the scene.\n\nThe Nunes memo released on Friday, however, makes clear that Steele was not a politically neutral actor.\n\nSteele was commissioned by a Washington private intelligence company, Fusion GPS. It was hired first by conservative underwriters, then Democrats, to conduct opposition research about Trump in 2016. All the same, Fusion GPS' founder, Glenn Simpson, has told Congress that he did not instruct Steele to go dig up dirt on Trump.\n\nRather, in his account, Simpson gave Steele an open-ended assignment to find out what he could from sources in Russia he'd cultivated over his career. Steele, according to Simpson, was shocked by what he learned and volunteered on his own to report it all to the FBI.\n\nFriday's memo complicates that picture. According to the Nunes memo, Steele told a contact at the Justice Department that he was \"desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.\"\n\nThat, for Republicans, is more evidence that anti-Trump bias is at the bottom of the DOJ's Russia investigation. And the memo charges that although the FBI \"recorded\" Steele's feelings, it was \"not reflected in any of the Page FISA applications.\"\n\nUnlike the Nunes memo, however, those underlying documents, remain secret.\n\nSimpson told Congress that one reason Steele broke with the FBI, which the Nunes memo also describes, was he felt the bureau wasn't taking him seriously enough. And Steele was mystified, in Simpson's telling, by a story in The New York Times in which FBI officials said they had no clear link between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nBut that story appeared on Oct. 31, 2016 \u2014 10 days after the FBI and DOJ applied for their warrant on Page, according to the memo declassified and released Friday. The evidence now shows the FBI certainly thought there was a connection, and it has since become clear the bureau had been running a counterintelligence investigation since July 2016.\n\nWas the Times' story a sin of omission by the FBI or one of commission? Did the people who talked with Times reporters Eric Lightblau and Steven Lee Myers not know about the investigative work that was then underway \u2014 or did they mislead the reporters because they wanted to protect their work and not spook potential targets of the investigation in Trump world?\n\nFurther confusing the matter is a Washington Post story from April of 2017. It describes a FISA warrant targeting Page \"last summer,\" based in part on his trip to Moscow and what it calls prior contacts with Russian intelligence operatives.\n\nDoes that mean the Oct. 21, 2016, warrant application referenced in the declassified memo was actually a reauthorization of an earlier one? There is no independent accounting of events at this time to clear up these questions.\n\nFor the House Intelligence Committee's GOP majority, it's not a story about Americans potentially conspiring with a foreign attack on the democratic process. Instead, it's a story about abuse of power, and a hapless martyr in Carter Page.\n\nThe memo saga sucked up all the oxygen in Washington, D.C., this week, but it remains to be seen whether it proves a tactical victory or a strategic one. Republicans' memo targeted the weakest aspect of the collusion storyline within the Russia imbroglio \u2014 a dossier virtually no one defends \u2014 and singled out what they called politically biased FBI and Justice Department officials.\n\nThe collusion case has always been broader than the dossier. Several people in the Trump campaign had contacts with Russians, including Papadopoulos, Page, onetime Trump national security adviser Mike Flynn, now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump Jr., then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and others. Trump Jr., Kushner and Manafort hosted a delegation of Russians at Trump Tower in June 2016 following what was described to Trump Jr. as the Russian government's desire to support Trump's campaign by providing information about Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's allies have pushed in all their chips on a strategy of tearing down federal law enforcement, within guardrails established by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to preserve the agencies' current leaders in their jobs. Trump has already fired one FBI director, James Comey, and reportedly wanted to fire the Justice Department's special counsel, Robert Mueller.\n\nSo although whatever Mueller's office yields will have been prefigured by months of attacks, including the Nunes memo, nothing in the document directly implicates Mueller or his current team. The question now is how much credibility Mueller, the FBI and DOJ will retain by the next time they act in their investigation.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Domenico Montanaro", "body": "A pedestrian walks past Austin City Hall, an early voting center, on Tuesday in Austin, Texas.\n                \n                \n                    \n                    Drew Anthony Smith/Getty Images\n                    \n                \n                hide caption\n            \n\n        \n\n\n\n            toggle caption\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n        Drew Anthony Smith/Getty Images\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A pedestrian walks past Austin City Hall, an early voting center, on Tuesday in Austin, Texas.\n\n        \n            \n            Drew Anthony Smith/Getty Images\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n   \n\n   Launching the 2018 election cycle, Texans cast ballots in primaries on Tuesday \u2014 leaving several races headed for runoffs.\n   Election night in Texas offers several takeaways of note, as we look ahead. Here are six to consider:\n   \n   \n\n   1. Texas is still Texas. Turn Texas blue? Not so fast. For all the attention on Democratic turnout \u2014 and turnout was high for Democrats \u2014 they were swamped by voters on the GOP side. Check out the the total vote in the big statewide races, for example. More than 1 million Democrats turned out for the Senate primary that has gotten so much national attention because of the candidacy of Rep. Beto O'Rourke. That was double the Democratic primary turnout in the last midterm. But look at the GOP side: There was 50 percent higher turnout for the uncontested GOP Senate primary featuring incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz. (That was even up slightly from 2014 for Republicans.)\n   Wayne Slater, retired senior political writer for The Dallas Morning News, says he is skeptical of a statewide Democratic wave in Texas, because of the voters who are fueling both parties. The Democratic vote was up in the 15 most populous counties, but the rural vote is still overwhelmingly Republican. Two-thirds of the Democratic vote came from more populous counties, he said, while just 55 percent of the Republican vote did. Tuesday night proved, he said, \"Rural Texas still substantially gives it to Republicans.\" So until that changes, or until Latinos in South Texas truly get fired up for a favored Democratic statewide candidate, \"This whole stuff about a blue wave coming, don't hang your hat on that,\" Slater said.\n   \n            Dems' turnout spike was far from evenly distributed on the map. Biggest jumps relative to '14/'10 came in major metros/wealthy suburbs. That bodes well for Dems in #TX07  #TX32 and maybe #TX23. Less so in statewide races.\n\u2014 Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) March 7, 2018\n\n   \n\n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   2. No sure Bet-o. Cruz got double the votes of O'Rourke, and a largely unknown, underfinanced 32-year-old named Sema Hernandez got nearly a quarter of the vote in the Democratic primary. That doesn't bode well for O'Rourke. Expect Cruz (and his sharp-elbowed operatives) to run a tough campaign, targeting O'Rourke, including that his given name is Robert and Cruz's is Rafael in Latino-heavy Texas and that O'Rourke is too liberal for Texas. In fact, the Cruz campaign is already up with a radio ad with the line, \"If you're gonna run in Texas, you can't be a liberal man ...\"\n   \n   3. The suburbs are still the key to the House \u2014 and Democrats are faring well there. For all that cold water for Democrats statewide in Texas, at the same time there is this silver lining for them \u2014 turnout in the three Republican House districts they hope to flip was on par or outpaced that of Republicans. Yes, those were competitive primaries for Democrats while the GOP is running three incumbents who faced token opposition, but those districts are still in play \u2014 and they're happening in the suburbs, where Trump's approval rating is suffering. Specifically, Democratic turnout surged in major metropolitan areas \u2014 and the wealthy suburbs, as The Cook Political Report's David Wasserman points out.\n   \n    \n\n    \n\n   \n   \n\n   4. The power of female Democratic candidates is real. We've written about the record number of women running for office in 2018. Well, the power of women was felt in the Democratic primaries Tuesday night. Nearly half of the candidates who finished first in Democratic primaries were women (17 of 35). What's more, Texas is more than likely to send two Latinas to Congress. Remarkably, Veronica Escobar, an El Paso County judge running to fill O'Rourke's House seat, and state Sen. Sylvia Garcia, running to replace Democratic Rep. Gene Green in Houston, are the overwhelming favorites to be the first Latinas sent to Congress from Texas. That is really quite something in a state where nearly 4 in 10 people are Latino.\n   \n   \n\n   5. The anti-establishment sentiment is as strong as ever. If anyone thinks either party will be able to put a thumb on the scale for any candidate this year, Texas provided a few flashing red lights. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee published opposition research on congressional candidate Laura Moser, highlighting that she wrote she wouldn't want to live in Paris, Texas, again. It tried to undercut her \u2014 because it believes she would lose in a general election in a winnable seat in the Houston suburbs \u2014 but this, instead, backfired. The gambit raised her profile and helped propel Moser into a May 22 runoff. And a Democratic candidate endorsed by House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer was edged out by a political novice, who is a pastor and former math teacher. (They will face each other in a May 22 runoff, though.)\n   6. Money can't necessarily buy you primary love. There was a time when the candidate with the most money could be seen as the favorite. And when that candidate raised $1 million or more before a primary, he or she was really seen as a favorite. But the energy clearly was not with those candidates Tuesday night in Texas \u2014 on both sides. In four races, those candidates missed even making it to runoffs. A candidate who put in $6 million of her own money in the GOP primary in the 2nd Congressional District finished third and got just 12,000 votes. In the 7th District GOP primary, another who raised $1.1 million finished fourth with just 5,000 votes. On the Democratic side, in the 16th District, a candidate who raised just shy of $1 million finished second \u2014 but with only about 11,000 votes missed the runoff; and a candidate in the 32nd District also raised almost $1 million and finished third with just 5,500 votes. That's $9 million for 33,500 votes, or $269 a vote \u2014 and four losses.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Scott Neuman", "body": "Ex-French President Questioned On Claims He Took Campaign Funds From Gadhafi\n\nFormer French President Nicolas Sarkozy is being detained for questioning as part of an investigation looking into allegations that he took millions of euros from Libya to fund his 2007 election campaign.\n\nPolice took Sarkozy into custody on Tuesday as part of investigation that began in 2013.

Bush appointee, accused Kobach of engaging in \"gamesmanship\" and skirting her orders.\n\nIn the nearly two years since Robinson ordered him to register those voters, she said, he has forced her and the American Civil Liberties Union to monitor his actions down to the tiniest details in an effort to get him to comply.\n\n\"I've had to police this over and over and over again,\" she said.\n\nThe ACLU, representing Kansans suing Kobach, asked Robinson in September, 2016, to hold Kobach in contempt for failing to comply with her May, 2016, order to fully register would-be voters. Their applications lacked birth certificates or other documents Kobach demanded under a 2011 Kansas law.\n\nA series of back-and-forths between Kobach, the ACLU, and the judge since then have turned on what actions were needed to meet the court's order. They centered on requiring Kobach to ensure the registrants would know they could vote, and that county election officers would know to treat them the same as other voters.\n\nThe ACLU argued Tuesday that Kobach didn't follow through. Robinson will consider whether to hold him in contempt while working on a ruling in this month's trial against Kobach.\n\nThat trial wrapped up Monday. Kobach stands accused of violating federal law by refusing to register more than 30,000 legitimate voters who signed up to vote through driver's license offices.\n\n\"It's an election year, your honor, and there's no more time for games,\" ACLU lawyer Dale Ho told Robinson.\n\nKobach, who hopes to be Kansas' next governor, asked the judge not to find him in contempt. The Republican candidate argued he doesn't control the county officials who carry out logistics such as sending postcards to voters to let them know where their polling stations are.\n\n\"We ask them to do things. We plead with them to do things,\" he said. \"If the counties did fail, it was their mistake.\"\n\nThat's one of the things the ACLU said has been a problem: Not all the voters protected by Robinson's 2016 preliminary injunction have been receiving the postcards.\n\nRobinson, at times sounding livid with the secretary, gave him a dressing-down.\n\n\"These people are not second-class registered voters,\" she told him. \"You assured me that they had or they would get the postcards.\"\n\nShe questioned why Kobach had had no problem getting Kansas' 105 counties to require birth certificates and similar documents from voters in recent years, yet denied he could make them mail postcards or comply with other aspects of her orders.\n\nKobach is a key backer of President Donald Trump's claim that Hillary Clinton won the 2016 popular vote because of millions of illegal ballots. He led Trump's now defunct election integrity commission.\n\nHe urged the Kansas legislature to adopt a law that required would-be voters, starting in 2013, to show passports, military papers, birth certificates, or other documents proving they are citizens. That prompted a lawsuit by the League of Women Voters, saying it decimated voter registration drives, and by Kansans who say they were blocked from voting because they lacked such papers.\n\nThe ACLU is representing them. It says Kobach can't enforce his law on voters who register while getting or renewing their driver's licenses because they are protected by the 1993 Motor Voter Act.\n\nThat law created the streamlined process for registering to vote at driver's license offices, where around 40 percent of Kansans put themselves on the voter rolls.\n\nTo win his case, Kobach had to prove a significant number of non-citizens illegally registered to vote and that making people show proof of citizenship is the only way to stop it.\n\nHe denied allegations of voter suppression, and put experts on the stand to present polls and surveys that they say show almost all Kansans have easy access to documents like birth certificates.

We want to build our planes. We want to build our military equipment with steel, with aluminum from our country,\" he said at a March 8 White House press conference.\n   In other words, the U.S. military should be as self-sufficient as possible, and not rely on other countries to supply the essential materials it needs for defense.\n   It's an argument that makes sense at some level, but it also obscures a broader truth about military spending in the global economy: Supply chains have become so complex that it would be virtually impossible for the U.S. military to go it alone.\n   \"Almost any item that you could look at [that] says 'Made in the USA' on it, frequently there is some content in it that comes from overseas,\" says former Pentagon official Andrew Hunter, now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n   \n    \n\n    \n\n   \n   \n\n   Trump may want to prop up the aluminum industry, for example, but to make it requires bauxite, a material that has become too expensive to mine in the United States, The Wall Street Journal reported recently.\n   Congress already requires the Pentagon to give preference to domestic manufacturers whenever possible, Hunter says. Certain materials such as stainless steel must be bought from U.S. suppliers.\n   The reasons are political rather than strategic, he says.\n   \"A lot of that is driven by a pretty simple sentiment, which is when people give their tax dollars to support the national defense, they hope that those taxpayers are being used in a way that also further supports the economy,\" Hunter says.\n   Also given preference are certain countries such as Canada with which the U.S. has reciprocal trading agreements. In some cases, such as aircraft made by the Brazilian company Embraer, the U.S. allows products to be partly manufactured overseas, as long as they are finished domestically.\n   There's another question raised by the president's steel and aluminum tariffs: How necessary are they, really?\n   To impose them, Trump is implementing Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, a rarely used law that gives presidents great leeway to protect industries deemed vital to national defense.\n   \n   \n\n   \"The case in 232 is the argument that for national security reasons we need to maintain a high level of production of some particular commodity,\" says Nicholas Lardy, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n   \"One way of doing that is to put on a tariff, which makes imported goods more expensive and makes it more likely that the domestic firms will be able to continue production,\" he adds.\n   There's no question steel is an essential part of a wide range of weapons and other goods used by the military, from tanks to battleships.\n   But as much as the steel industry has shrunk over the years, the U.S. still produces millions of tons of it each year, Lardy says.\n   \"The steel used by the United States military in tanks and all kinds of other uses is a very, very small portion of total production \u00e2\u20ac\u201d well under 10 percent. The industry is not in decline in terms of output, so arguing that we need to put on tariffs now to preserve a steel industry that is essential to national security I think is a bit of a stretch,\" Lardy says.\n   And in the unlikely event that the U.S. runs out of steel, it has plenty of other places to get it.\n   Much of the steel imported today comes from friendly countries such as Canada, South Korea, Japan and the United Kingdom, with which the U.S. has strong military alliances.\n   The Trump administration has temporarily exempted Canada and Mexico from the tariffs and has suggested it may add other countries.\n   Lardy says the tariffs could invite retaliation by other countries.\n   \"If we're protecting steel, other countries could protect a product they want to protect and say that it's for national security reasons.

New York is trying to use that information to build a comprehensive record of gun owners \u2014 something only one other state has done. The database that California started in 2007 has gotten mixed reviews.   New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, has said he wants to make sure that people who can't legally own guns \u2013 those with criminal convictions, serious mental health issues, or active restraining orders \u2014 aren't somehow falling through the cracks and holding onto their firearms.   Anyone who took out a handgun license in New York before 2013 \u2014 the year the state passed a landmark gun control law \u2014 had to contact state police by Jan. 31 or risk criminal charges. That's caused a real backlash, particularly among rural gun owners, who don't entirely trust their state's intentions.    A commonsense plan?   The Albany Gun Show is a winter fixture in upstate New York. On the show's opening day in mid-January, Tom King, president of the NRA-affiliated New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, posted up beyond all the folding tables stacked with rifles and holsters.    \n    \n\n    \n\n   \n    \n\n    \n\n   \n   \n\n   King said he spent hours and hours answering a question that seemed to be on everyone's mind. \"People are saying, 'Do I have to register or don't I have to register?' So yeah,\" King said. \"There is a lot of confusion.\"   The confusion, he said, is about why the state of New York wants information for its new handgun database. It's actually been on the books since 2013.   In the months after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, several states adopted tougher gun control measures. New York passed a law known as the SAFE Act, which banned most assault weapons. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he wanted to go even further.   \n   \"We'll have for the first time a statewide handgun database that will allow the state, allow local officials to check periodically,\" Cuomo said. The plan lawmakers approved calls for detailed information on hundreds of thousands of legally licensed handgun owners and their weapons \u2013 down to make, model and serial numbers. Some of that information was already available on gun permit applications filed at county clerk's offices across the state, but it was often outdated or incomplete.   State police will build a database they can check against criminal records, alerts filed by mental health professionals, and restraining orders. Only law enforcement can see the information, not the public.    Cuomo described it as a system based on commonsense. \"You don't want criminals and people who are mentally ill to have guns,\" he said. Once the law passed, state police began collecting information from every person who applied for a new handgun permit.    \"You can't make them criminals.\"   The SAFE Act has been popular in urban areas, according to polling data. But some rural gun owners have resisted from the beginning. As the first big handgun registration deadline approached this winter, for people who got their guns prior to 2013, the pushback grew more intense.   Talk radio host Bill Robinson has lashed out at the state on \"The Second Amendment Radio Show,\" which he hosts for a small station near Rochester. \"The government shouldn't have master lists of us gun owners and the specific guns we have,\" Robinson said on a recent episode. \"They don't need it!\"   \n   \n\n   A lot of gun owners are angry. While they can agree that so-called \"bad guys\" shouldn't have access to weapons, some fear that New York is trying to turn them into those bad guys. It goes back to the penalties associated with this registration process. The SAFE Act says failure to register handguns is a felony offense \u2014 and gun permits are automatically revoked.   \"You just can't do that to people that live in your state, that are lawful gun owners,\" Tom King said. \"You can't make them, overnight, criminals.\"   King is most worried about those who had handguns before the 2013 law went into effect, but all handgun owners will have to check back in every five years.   No response from 81,000 gun owners   As of the deadline, more than 81,000 people \u2013 or 20 percent of affected handgun owners in New York \u2013 haven't responded to the state's request. But New York State Police spokesman Beau Duffy argues that concern about this gun database has been overblown. He said felony charges are off the table for now. \"We're not going to take criminal enforcement action, particularly with those people who were unaware of this re-certification process,\" Duffy said.    The next big question is how this registry is going to be used and who's going to follow up with gun owners. Laura Cutilletta, legal director for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, believes it could be a game-changer for police.   \n            \n\n    \n        \n            \n                Ray Kosorek, center, sells a raffle ticket to Shawn Latour, left, at the Gun Owners of America booth inside the Albany Gun Show in January.

They're too expensive, she said. New York set aside $28 million for its database, and California tucked away $24 million.   Instead, Cutilletta said, she and other gun control advocates are pushing for new kinds of restraining orders \u2013 called \"extreme risk protection orders.\" They allow families and police to take their concerns to court and request permission from a judge to take guns away from people who could potentially do harm.

The State Archives describes the somewhat ambiguous position Maryland held, saying it \"was walking a tightrope between the Union and the Confederacy. In addition to being physically between the two sides, Maryland depended equally on the North and the South for its economy. Although Maryland had always leaned toward the south culturally, sympathies in the state were as much pro-Union as they were pro-Confederate.\"\n\nSet to the tune of \"O, Tannenbaum,\" Randall's poem became a song, attaining popularity in Maryland and farther south, but it wasn't until 1939 that it was officially adopted as the state song.\n\nRepublican Sen. Bob Cassilly told NPR in an email that while he disagrees with the Confederate cause Randall extolled, he said the poem also invokes the Revolutionary War. \"I cannot help but be inspired by his poetic references to Maryland's history to justify a call to action and it is wrong to reject his contributions to our culture simply as a matter of ideological purity,\" he said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader J.B.

In fact, according to the U.S. Trade Representative in 2016, the U.S. had a $12.5 billion goods and services trade surplus with Canada. Trump sometimes ignores trade in services, which pumps up trade deficit numbers, but that isn't an accurate way to look at the U.S. trade relationship with other countries.\n\nAs she tried to explain why Trump had been right all along, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders cited trade in goods alone, leaving out trade in services. Services make up a significantly larger share of the US economy than goods production. And it isn't clear from Trump's remarks whether that is really what he was talking about.\n\nTrump was in the midst of a 30-minute speech at a fundraiser in St. Louis on Wednesday when, according to the Washington Post write-up, he riffed on a conversation he'd had with Trudeau.\n\n\" 'Trudeau came to see me.

Those tariffs won't immediately apply to Canada and Mexico, as those countries are in the midst of renegotiating, along with the U.S., the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Based on other comments, Trump is planning to leverage the threat of tariffs to negotiate better trade terms with U.S. trading partners.\n\nIt's not clear how this admission that the president contradicted another world leader without basis will affect future negotiations or relationships with Trudeau and other leaders. A failure to agree on basic facts would seem to make such negotiations more difficult.\n\nAsked by reporters during a photo opportunity in the Oval Office whether he has always been truthful with Trudeau, Trump ignored the question.\n\nBut he is standing by his assertion that the U.S. has a trade deficit with Canada, tweeting Thursday morning, \"P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn't like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and that's how I know!\"\n\nCanada is America's second-largest goods trading partner, according to U.S. data.

McMaster is leaving the Trump administration, the president announced on Twitter Thursday evening. \"I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend,\" the president wrote. Trump also said former Amb. John Bolton will replace McMaster in a change that takes effect April 9.\n\nThe planned change at the top of the country's national security infrastructure comes after McMaster had an unsettled tenure inside a White House that recently has been expelling its top officials like a deflating balloon.\n\nIn a separate statement, McMaster said he was requesting retirement from the U.S. Army effective this summer. \"I am thankful to President Donald J. Trump for the opportunity to serve him and our nation as national security advisor,\" McMaster said. \"I am grateful for the friendship and support of the members of the National Security Council who worked together to provide the President with the best options to protect and advance our national interests.\"\n\nMcMaster was a storied Army field commander who became a well-known skeptic about bureaucratic indecision at the highest levels in Washington, D.C.\n\nHe enjoyed support from some in top posts, including Defense Secretary James Mattis, when Trump began searching for a replacement for his disgraced first national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn.\n\nFlynn was one of Trump's first close political advisers and an early joiner in his upstart political campaign, but he was forced out over his role in the Russia imbroglio. Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russia's then-ambassador to the United States.\n\nSo Trump, who never served in the military and never held elected office, needed another counselor and, in a relatively rare decision, picked an active-duty Army general in McMaster.\n\nMcMaster and Trump at first appeared simpatico in broad aspects of their worldview. They wanted a United States that mixed it up with competing world powers, throwing geopolitical elbows to gain advantage in the way they saw other nations throwing theirs.\n\nIt fell to McMaster, however, to translate Trump's doctrine on Inauguration Day about \"America First\" into one that could comport with the country's many important global alliances.\n\nThat's what led to the corollary that \"America First\" didn't mean \"America Alone,\" but it did mean that the U.S. wanted to be a contender as much as a leader.\n\n\"The president embarked on his first foreign trip with a clear-eyed outlook that the world is not a 'global community' but an arena where nations, nongovernmental actors, and businesses engage and compete for advantage,\" McMaster wrote with Trump's then-chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn \u2014 who has also since stepped down.\n\n\"We bring to this forum unmatched military, political, economic, cultural, and moral strength.

Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reportedly called Trump a \"moron,\" and lost his job.

It was able to to gain access to at least one power plant's control system.\n\n\"They were not simply looking around that system and reconnoitering it,\" Joel Brenner, former head of counter intelligence under the Director of National Intelligence in the Obama administration, told NPR. \"They were placing the tools that they would have to place in order to turn off the power. That's a serious vulnerability for us and we're not anywhere near ready to deal with it.\"\n\nThe Russians have targeted other countries' electrical grids, most notably Ukraine, in 2015, disrupting power for more than 200,000 people.\n\nScott Aaronson, vice president of security and preparedness at the Edison Electric Institute, which represents the nation's electric companies, said U.S. power companies have tried to learn from that attack.\n\nCan Americans feel confident the U.S. grid is protected?\n\n\"Very much so,\" Aaronson claimed. \"The electric power sector takes a lot of different measures to protect our systems.\"\n\nThat includes operating power plants without digital controls, just like in the old days, he said.\n\n\"I tell people one of the best ways to protect against a cyber threat is to not rely on cyber assets,\" Aaronson said, adding that the U.S. power grid \"operated for the better part of the last century\" without digital controls.\n\nHe also said utilities can \"go back to a less-efficient means of operating but still keep the lights on.\"\n\nSome power companies also block emails and other Internet traffic from outside the country.\n\nBut protecting the grid is complicated by its decentralized nature, with public utility commissions in 50 states exercising some control.\n\nCritics say the Trump administration needs to take stronger steps to block these kinds of attacks from Russia. At a hearing Tuesday, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash. called the DHS alert a siren.\n\n\"Our energy infrastructure is under attack,\" Cantwell said. \"It's under cyber-attack, and we need to do much more to protect it as a national critical asset.\"\n\nCantwell wants the Trump administration to do an assessment of Russian cyber attacks against the electric grid. The Department of Energy is establishing a new Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, that will focus on energy infrastructure security.\n\nBut any retaliation in response to Russia's cyber incursion would be up to President Trump.\n\nBut, as Brenner points out: \"The president has not so far shown any inclination or any backbone in confronting repeated Russian provocations. And one can only ask why that is.\"\n\nBrenner added that Russian President Vladimir Putin is \"playing ju-jitsu with us.\"\n\n\"Nobody wants a war,\" he said, adding the hostilities taking place now \"are in the gray space between war and peace.\"\n\nCSIS' Lewis said absent a strong U.S. response to the Russian cyber incursions though, Russia is likely to continue its' behavior.\n\n\"The problem here is if we don't give the Russians the idea that doing something to us is bad, they may be tempted to do it,\" Lewis said.\n\nAnd while sanctions can function as somewhat of a deterrent to further intrusions, they also may not be enough.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Richard Gonzales", "body": "The Federal Emergency Management Agency, the federal government's first responder to floods, hurricanes and other natural disasters, has eliminated references to climate change from its strategic planning document for the next four years.\n\nThat document, released by FEMA on Thursday, outlines plans for building preparedness and reducing the complexity of the agency.\n\nThe document does not say what could be contributing to \"rising natural hazard risk,\" or what conditions could require the \"increased investments in pre-disaster mitigation.\"\n\nSimilarly, under a section about \"Emerging Threats,\" the document cites cybersecurity and terrorism.

Previously obscured by language and by sheer volume of tweets, Torshin has written numerous times about his connections with the NRA, of which he's a known paid lifetime member. NPR has translated a selection of those posts that document Torshin's relationship to the group.\n\nThese revelations come amid news that the FBI is investigating whether Torshin, the deputy governor of the Bank of Russia, illegally funneled money to the National Rifle Association to assist the Trump campaign in 2016, McClatchy reported in January.\n\nIn a letter to Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Senate intelligence committee, the NRA denied any wrongdoing and suggested the FBI is investigating Torshin, not the NRA. Neither the NRA nor Torshin responded to inquiries from NPR.\n\nInvestigations by Congress and the Department of Justice have revealed that the Russian government has sought to sharpen political divisions among American citizens by amplifying controversial social issues. Investigators have expressed concern about Russian links to the NRA, one of the most politically polarizing organizations in the U.S.\n\nTorshin is a former Russian senator and served as the deputy speaker of Russia's parliament for more than a decade. Known as a Putin ally, he also spent time on Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee, a state body that includes the director of Russia's internal security service and the ministers of defense, interior and foreign affairs.\n\nTorshin's use of NRA connections to open doors, and his 2015 claim to know Trump through the organization, raise new questions about the group's connections with Russian officials \u2014 at a time when the organization is being roundly criticized by its opponents, and at times the president himself, for being a factor in American gun violence.\n\nTranslation: \"For 15 years, I've traveled to the US with official delegations, and more often - privately. In this time, I NEVER HEARD ONE BAD WORD ABOUT RUSSIA!\"\n\nAmong his tens of thousands of tweets, Torshin also documented his attendance at every NRA convention between 2012 and 2016, only some of which have been previously reported.\n\nOn his verified Twitter account, Torshin talked about how he knew Donald Trump through the NRA, citing a connection at the 2015 convention. Responding to a tweet about comedian Larry David accusing Trump of being a racist, Torshin said he knew the businessman through the NRA, and defended him.\n\nTranslation: \"A comedian should make people laugh! Right? So he is trying! I know D. Trump (through NRA). A decent person.\"\n\n\"I saw him in Nashville\" in April 2015, Torshin added later, the date and site of the NRA's 2015 convention. Trump gave a speech at that convention, the outlines of which would become familiar as his stump speech throughout the 2016 presidential campaign. The White House did not respond to repeated requests for comment by NPR, but denied Trump has ever met Torshin to Bloomberg News in 2017.\n\nTorshin's attendance at the NRA convention in 2016 is where he reportedly met with Donald Trump, Jr.\n\nTorshin had made repeated attempts to meet with Donald Trump himself at that convention during the presidential election year, but there is no evidence of this occurring. A conservative activist with ties to Torshin aide Maria Butina reached out to the Trump campaign in 2016, saying that Russia was \"quietly but actively seeking a dialogue with the U.S.\" and would try to use the NRA convention to make \"first contact,\" the New York Times reported.\n\n\"Putin is deadly serious about building a good relationship with Mr. Trump,\" the activist, Paul Erickson wrote. \"He wants to extend an invitation to Mr. Trump to visit him in the Kremlin before the election.\" Erickson has business ties to Butina, having started an LLC with her in South Dakota.\n\nTorshin has used his repeated trips to NRA conventions to cultivate relationships with top NRA officials. And his Twitter account documents that he has personally met with every person who has been president of the NRA since 2012.\n\nOn Twitter, Torshin portrayed these meetings as more than merely casual encounters. In 2017, he tweeted that he was bringing a gift to then-NRA President Allan Cors, and suggested he was familiar with Cors' hobbies.\n\nTranslation: \"Bought a gift for NRA President Allan Cors. Tanks are his favorite topic!\"\n\nCors is the founder of the Virginia Museum of Military Vehicles, according to its website.\n\nIn a public DropBox album that Torshin linked to from his Twitter account, he's seen meeting with former NRA president Jim Porter, as well as former NRA president David Keene.\n\nHis tweets suggest a longtime relationship with Keene, who repeatedly appears in photos as Torshin documents his visits, suggesting that their meeting was not merely coincidental. Keene did not respond a request for comment.\n\nTorshin has also met the current president of the NRA, Pete Brownell. Brownell was part of an NRA delegation that visited Moscow in 2015.\n\nThese relationships that he cultivated appeared to open another door. Torshin came to the United States in 2012 as an international election observer, and watched as ballots were cast during the Obama-Romney presidential contest in Tennessee. This was possible, he wrote, due to his NRA links.\n\nTranslation: \"I was there at Obama's last election! The NRA card, to me as an observer from Russia, opened access to any [polling] station.\"\n\n\"Tennessee resident Kline Preston requested Mr. Torshin to be an international observer in November 2012,\" Adam Ghassemi, a spokesman for the Tennessee Secretary of State, told NPR. The Washington Post reported last year that Preston, a Tennessee lawyer, was the one who originally introduced Torshin to former NRA president David Keene back in 2011.\n\nThe heat is on the Russian politician, who was alleged by Spanish police to have directed financial transactions for the Russian mob. Not only is the FBI reportedly investigating him \u2014 the bureau declined to comment for this story \u2014 but lawmakers involved in congressional investigations have also expressed interest in Torshin.\n\nBoth the Senate and House intelligence committees are currently engaged in investigations into potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nWyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee and a member of the Senate intelligence committee, has demanded the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network hand over documents related to Torshin and the NRA.\n\n\"The NRA and its related entities do not accept funds from foreign persons or entities in connection with United States elections,\" NRA General Counsel John Frazer wrote in response to a request from Wyden to turn over documents related to transactions between the NRA and Russian citizens. \"NRA political decisions are made by NRA officers and executive staff, all of whom are United States citizens. No foreign nationals are consulted in any way on these decisions.\"\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, told NPR this week that the committee's members have asked relevant witnesses about the NRA through the course of their investigation.\n\n\"I can't go into what we've been able to learn thus far on that issue. I can tell you it's one of deep concern to me and to other members of the committee, that we get to the bottom of these allegations that the Russians may have sought to funnel money through the NRA,\" Schiff said. \"It would be negligent of us not to investigate.\"\n\nGlenn Simpson, the co-founder of research firm Fusion GPS, alluded to Torshin and the NRA during his closed-door testimony before the House intelligence committee in November.\n\n\"It appears the Russians, you know, infiltrated the NRA. And there is more than one explanation for why,\" Simpson told lawmakers. \"But I would say broadly speaking, it appears that the Russian operation was designed to infiltrate conservative organizations. And they targeted various conservative organizations, religious and otherwise, and they seem to have made a very concerted effort to get in with the NRA.\"\n\nNot only are congressional investigators interested in the NRA's relationship with Russia, but this inquiry comes as the NRA is receiving additional pressure from groups hoping to pass additional gun restrictions into law, and as dozens of American companies have cut ties with the NRA in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., shooting last month.\n\n\"These revelations suggest that for years the NRA courted a top Putin ally who is now reportedly attracting scrutiny from the FBI,\" John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, told NPR. \"NRA leaders still haven't explained their close relationship with Russian officials in Putin's orbit.

But by the time the candidate bounces through the door, they're unfolding dozens more chairs as the crowd zooms past 100.\n\nO'Rourke, who currently represents the El Paso area in the U.S. House, is running for the chance to unseat the Republican incumbent, Ted Cruz. No Democrat has represented the Lone Star State in the Senate since 1993, but O'Rourke believes he can beat the odds, in part by campaigning aggressively in every part of this sprawling state.\n\n\"Of the 254 counties [in Texas], we've visited 226 so far. This is 226 today,\" O'Rourke tells the crowd, who have been chanting, \"Beto, Beto!\"\n\nO'Rourke has his work cut out for him.

Cruz raised about $800,000 during the same period. \"I just haven't seen this kind of excitement and energy and willingness to do what it takes in Texas in my life,\" O'Rourke added.\n\nThat fundraising may help him make up for the lack of awareness Texas voters have of the Democrat, according to Texas Tribune executive editor and political analyst Ross Ramsey. \"I think he'll have enough money, whether they vote red or blue in November, Texans will know who Beto O'Rourke really is,\" Ramsey told NPR.\n\nO'Rourke is capitalizing on an extremely restive Democratic electorate. Although Texas Democrats have been largely shut out of statewide office for the past two decades, they've been closing the gap with Republicans. In 2016, Hillary Clinton got 600,000 more votes in Texas than Barack Obama did just four years earlier. President Trump won the state by about 9 percent.\n\nO'Rourke says the president has a lot to do with the energy among Democrats.\n\n\"They're coming out because they don't want a wall [with Mexico]. People are coming out because they don't want to hear the president refer the countries of Africa as 's***hole' nations,\" said O'Rourke. \"People are coming out because they don't think the press is the enemy of the people they think they're the best defense against tyranny. People are coming out because they want women to be treated with dignity and respect.\"\n\nThe tall, thin, 45-year-old O'Rourke sometimes gets described as a West Texas version of John F. Kennedy. But it's O'Rourke's unabashed liberalism and earnest delivery that makes Democrats swoon.\n\nAt the Pittsburg event, O'Rourke criticized the state's decision to shut down family planning clinics, arguing it has resulted in sky-high maternal mortality rates. In a state where guns are sometimes seen as a birthright, he argues for universal background checks and an assault weapons ban.\n\nO'Rourke has two challengers in this Tuesday's upcoming Democratic primary, but had a 50 point lead in the latest polling.\n\nThis fall, it's likely O'Rourke will face Ted Cruz in the general election. Although Cruz's reputation with Republican voters suffered when he refused to endorse Donald Trump's nomination at the 2016 Republican National Convention, he is an accomplished fundraiser and formidable opponent.\n\nCruz's campaign did not respond to requests for comment, but Cruz is taking the race seriously.\n\nHe recently warned Houston-area Republicans, \"The left is going to show up. They will crawl over broken glass in November to vote.\"\n\nEarly voting numbers in Tuesday's Texas primaries show that Democrats have more than doubled their numbers from the same point in the 2014 midterms, while Republicans are up only 15 percent, according to David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report.\n\nRamsey warns that it's easy to read too much into early vote totals, since they may just indicate Democrats are taking advantage of the convenience of early voting. The final turnout on Tuesday will be a better indication of where things sit.\n\n\"It's still a Republican state. It would take a lot of things to fall in place, but that said, up to this date O'Rourke has a lot of things going for him,\" Ramsey said.\n\nHe added that many Texas political observers are reminding themselves that they saw the rise of another long-shot Senate candidate six years ago.\n\nHis name was Ted Cruz.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Martina Stewart", "body": "Source: Fired Deputy FBI Director Took Memos, Notes About Interactions With Trump\n\nBefore Washington, D.C., had fully processed the late-night firing of Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who was let go by Attorney General Jeff Sessions less than 48 hours before his planned retirement after more than two decades of service to the bureau, the saga took several new, head-spinning turns Saturday.\n\nMcCabe took notes and memos about his interactions with President Trump, similar to those prepared by his former boss and colleague James Comey, a source familiar with the issue told NPR. The source also said the McCabe documents corroborate Comey's account \u2014 which could play a key role in Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into obstruction of justice.\n\nThe McCabe memos are now in the possession of special counsel Robert Mueller's team of investigators, according to CNN and Axios. And, McCabe already sat for an interview with Mueller's team, Axios also reported.\n\nA personal lawyer for the president pointed to McCabe's ouster to argue it was time for the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race and any ties between Russians and the Trump campaign.\n\nThe attorney's remarks \u2014 though not intended to speak for the president \u2014 set off yet another round of concern among congressional Democrats about the status of the special counsel investigation and possible ways to protect it \u2014 and its leader, former FBI Director Robert Mueller \u2014 from being terminated by the White House or the Justice Department.\n\nAnd, McCabe's onetime boss, former FBI Director James Comey, sparred directly on Twitter with the president, who fired Comey in May of last year. Comey, on the verge of releasing a book, told Trump soon the American people \"can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.\"\n\nSessions announced late Friday that he had terminated McCabe's employment with the FBI \"effective immediately.\"\n\nThe attorney general pointed to internal recommendations from the Justice Department's inspector general and the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility that found \"McCabe had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor \u2212 including under oath \u2212 on multiple occasions,\" Sessions said in a statement announcing the firing.\n\n\"The FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability. As the OPR proposal stated, 'all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand,' \" Sessions also said.\n\nBut McCabe said his firing was politically motivated. \"I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey,\" McCabe said in his own late-night statement Friday. The former FBI official said he had been targeted because he can \"corroborate former Director Comey's accounts of his discussions with the President.\"\n\nMcCabe's attorney said in his own statement that the White House has attacked McCabe since last year with the result of putting \"inappropriate pressure\" on Sessions to oust McCabe. \"This intervention by the White House in the DOJ disciplinary process is unprecedented, deeply unfair, and dangerous,\" attorney Michael Bromwich said.\n\nBromwich also argued that the process by which the termination decision had been made was unfair and had been rushed, limiting the time he and McCabe had to access, review and analyze the relevant evidence in order to prepare a response.\n\nThe \"concerted effort to accelerate the process in order to beat the ticking clock of [McCabe's] scheduled retirement violates any sense of decency and basic principles of fairness,\" Bromwich said. (Sessions, for his part, said the internal investigation of McCabe had been \"extensive and fair\" and undertaken \"according to Department of Justice Procedure.\")\n\nThe McCabe firing added yet more fuel to the Russia imbroglio, an at least year-long conflagration that never wants for oxygen in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"This will be known as the Friday night slaughter,\" presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said on CNN soon after news of the ouster broke. Brinkley was referencing President Nixon's infamous \"Saturday Night Massacre\" of several senior Justice Department officials during the Watergate scandal.\n\nA personal lawyer for Trump seized on the firing and suggested it should provide motivation for the Justice Department to end the Mueller investigation altogether.\n\nSaying his was speaking for himself and not for Trump, attorney John Dowd said in a statement emailed to NPR that \"I pray that [Deputy Attorney General Rod] Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe's boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier.\"\n\n\"Just end it on the merits in light of recent revelations,\" Dowd explained, apparently alluding to the internal investigation that had ended McCabe's FBI career just before he planned to retire.\n\nThe top Democrat in the Senate said Dowd's view reflected the inclination of the president and his legal team to undermine the special counsel rather than to cooperate with Mueller's investigation.\n\n\"The president, the administration, and his legal team must not take any steps to curtail, interfere with, or end the special counsel's investigation or there will be severe consequences from both Democrats and Republicans,\" Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also said in a statement Saturday.\n\nThe top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee saw Dowd's remarks as a call to action for his colleagues. \"Every member of Congress, Republican and Democrat, needs to speak up in defense of the Special Counsel. Now,\" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., posted on Twitter.\n\nAlongside the response to Dowd, lawmakers, partisans, political observers and journalists responded to the firing \u2014 with Trump leaving no doubt how he felt.\n\nThe occasion of McCabe's firing was \"a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy,\" the president said in an early morning tweet. Trump also used the online posting to take a swipe at former FBI Director Comey; the president called Comey \"sanctimonious\" and suggested Comey \"knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!\"\n\nA former director of the CIA under President Obama slammed Trump after the president praised McCabe's ouster. \"[Y]ou will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,\" John Brennan posted on Twitter. \"You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America...America will triumph over you.\"\n\n\"Gloat now, but you will be fired soon,\" Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a member of both the House intelligence committee and the House Judiciary Committee, told Trump. \"There's a storm gathering, Mr. President,\" Swalwell added, and it's going to wipe out you and your corrupt organization all the way down to the studs.\"\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said on Twitter that the firing was an attempt to undermine McCabe as a witness in the special counsel investigation and was \"added evidence of obstruction of justice.\"\n\nAnd Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a member of both the Senate intelligence committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee said the attorney general \"needs to testify immediately before the Judiciary Committee\" about McCabe's firing. \"He must explain the DOJ's process and whether this is an attempt to target, punish or silence those investigating Russia and the Trump campaign.\"\n\nBut Republican lawmakers said Saturday that McCabe's termination was justified.\n\n\"I applaud Attorney General Jeff Sessions for taking action and firing former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe prior to his scheduled retirement,\" Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in a statement. The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee added that \"more must be done to root out the problems at the FBI. I remain extremely troubled by the decisions made by the Bureau during the 2016 presidential election and the role senior FBI officials played in these questionable decisions and irregularities.\"\n\nAnd Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., another member of the House Judiciary Committee, said McCabe's firing was \"a rare example of someone being held accountable in Washington.\"\n\nAs is his habit, the president took to Twitter Saturday afternoon to once again deny that his campaign had not colluded with Russia, citing a recently announced conclusion by the House intelligence committee. In a seeming reference to McCabe's termination, the president added that \"As many are now finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State.\"\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the House intelligence committee's top Democrat, quickly pointed out that the conclusion there had been no collusion was confined to the committee's Republicans \u2014 who, Schiff told Trump, were \"more interested in protecting you than learning the truth.\"\n\nIn another tweet Saturday afternoon, the president again took on the former FBI deputy director. \"McCabe was caught, called out and fired,\" Trump said, adding \"How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!\"\n\nComey responded within minutes: \"Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon. And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.\"\n\nBut Saturday's development may have included a bright side for McCabe.\n\nIn an effort to help McCabe complete the amount of employment necessary to qualify for his pension, Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., offered McCabe a job. \"My offer of employment to Mr. McCabe is a legitimate offer to work on election security,\" Pocan said in a press release.\n\nThe Democratic lawmaker added: \"Finally, I'd like to thank Mr. McCabe for his years of service to the FBI and our country. He deserves the full retirement that he has been promised, not to have it taken away as a result of the President's political games.\"", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Tamara Keith", "body": "President Trump speaks during a Cabinet meeting on June 12, 2017.

His willingness to say \"you're fired\" to so many people, so early in his administration is just another way Trump is unlike those who have come before him.\n   No elected first-term president in the past 100 years has had this much Cabinet turnover this early in his presidency. And going back to Ronald Reagan, the churn in top-level staff in the Trump White House is off the charts.\n   \n   \n\n   \"There will always be change, and I think you want to see change,\" Trump said Thursday not quite tamping down the latest rumors of possible Cabinet departures. \"And I want to also see different ideas.\"\n   \n   \n\n   In just under 14 months on the job, Trump has had more Cabinet turnover than 14 of his predecessors had in their first two years. Trump has already tied Presidents Ford and Harding, with three departures each. Ronald Reagan had four Cabinet departures and they all came well into his second year in office. \n   The three Cabinet members Trump has already replaced are Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who was pushed out after controversy over flying in charter aircraft; Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who became chief of staff over the summer; and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson who was fired by tweet recently over policy and personality clashes.\n   \n   \n\n   Several other members of the Cabinet are either clouded in controversy over possible misuse of public funds or otherwise earning the ire of President Trump. Other presidents with early Cabinet turnover saw departures for entirely different reasons.\n   \n    \n\n    \n\n   \n   \n\n   Herbert Hoover's first War Secretary, James Good, died suddenly 258 days into his tenure. Franklin D. Roosevelt's first Treasury Secretary, William Woodin, fell ill, writing after just nine months on the job \"the state of my health will not permit me to remain in this position.\" He died a few months later.\n   Over the approximately 100-year period reviewed for this story, there were Cabinet shake-ups and shuffles, secretaries who departed to take on new roles either in the administration or on the Supreme Court. There were resignations amidst policy disagreements, and perhaps most remarkably there was an agriculture secretary who served in the job for less than 90 days, while waiting to take office as governor of West Virginia.\n   First term 'dream team'\n   Typically in the first two years, a president has his dream team Cabinet in place and they are working hard to enact his vision. Then midterm elections come, people get tired and Cabinet shake-ups begin.\n   \n   \n\n   \"Other presidents wanted to save face for themselves and not look like their Cabinet is in disarray,\" said James Pfiffner, explaining one of many possible reasons for the typical early stability in presidential Cabinets.\n   Pfiffner is a professor of public policy at George Mason University who specializes in presidents and their Cabinets. Also, he says most presidents have a political background and choose Cabinet members they know and are compatible with who have long-established histories navigating Washington, D.C. Trump's original Cabinet included a number of outsiders, perhaps most notably Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who came from ExxonMobil and who Trump didn't know beforehand.\n   \"President Trump doesn't pay much attention to tradition or usual decorum or norms of the presidency,\" Pfiffner said, pointing out that Trump puts a premium on personal rapport. \"And so he does what he feels like, and continues to.\"\n   \n   \n\n   For this analysis, NPR looked at the first two years of Cabinet departures for presidents going back to Woodrow Wilson. We didn't count holdovers from previous administrations (especially prevalent when a president took over following a death or resignation), instead focusing on Senate-confirmed secretaries in each president's first two years and how long they lasted. Which jobs are considered Cabinet positions has changed over time, so we opted to use the same definition as the U.S. Senate historian. This means Trump's chief of staff and CIA director aren't part of the count, and neither is the administrator of the Small Business Administration (a position presidents Clinton and Carter had to refill early on).\n   As to whether Trump's tally of turnover is likely to rise anytime soon, press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked whether the president had offered assurances about job security to VA Secretary David Shulkin or HUD Secretary Ben Carson.

Jeannette Rankin, went to Congress. Republican Gov. Phil Bryant appointed Hyde-Smith to fill the seat being vacated by Sen. Thad Cochran, who announced that he would resign as of April 1 due to poor health.\n\nHyde-Smith, currently the state's Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce, will officially take over the seat on April 2, setting a new record of 23 women in the Senate.\n\nThat will leave just one state \u2014 Vermont \u2014 that has never sent a woman to Capitol Hill.\n\nThe chart below shows the years in which each state sent its first woman to Congress.\n\nHaving sent a woman early to Congress doesn't necessarily mean a state continued a pattern of electing women. While Montana sent the first woman to Congress in 1917, it has not elected any women to Congress since.\n\nImportantly, this history does not show when voters in each state elected their first woman to Congress.\n\nIndeed, with Hyde-Smith's appointment, Mississippi continues a nearly century-long pattern. In many states, the first woman sent to Congress was appointed or elected in a special election for a seat vacated by a man (often, this was the woman's deceased husband).\n\nIn fact, it was just 40 years ago, in 1978, that the first woman was elected to the Senate without having previously finished someone else's term, according to the Rutgers Center for American Women and Politics.\n\nHyde-Smith won't serve long as an appointed senator; she will have a special election in November to serve out the rest of Cochran's term.

With conservative strategist Steve Bannon playing a founding role, backed by money from billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, the firm was able to develop data from 50 million Facebook users into a psychologically-based strategy to target voters.\n\nNow there are legal questions about how it obtained that Facebook data. Investigations are gearing up in the U.S. and the U.K. The company this week suspended its CEO, Alexander Nix, over comments he made to undercover reporters from the British Television 4 News.\n\nU.S. campaign finance law may have a lot to say about this. Here are some of the biggest questions.\n\n1. Did Cambridge Analytica have a role in running the Trump campaign?\n\nTo hear now-suspended CEO Alexander Nix in the Television 4 News report, his firm handled almost everything except those Make America Great Again caps. He claimed it was responsible for all of the data, research, analytics and targeting, plus the digital and television campaigns. Notably, he said, \"Our data informed all the strategy.\"\n\nBut as a British firm, Cambridge Analytica runs into a federal statute that bars foreign involvement in American elections. The law was strengthened after the 1996 Clinton re-election effort had to disgorge millions of dollars from illegal donors.\n\n\"The Federal Election Campaign Act's prohibition on foreign contributions is the broadest prohibition in the entire statute,\" said Brett Kappel, a partner in the government affairs and public policy practice of the law firm Ackerman in Washington, D.C.\n\nOne provision of the law prohibits foreign nationals from holding decision-making positions in American campaigns. So the Trump campaign could hire Cambridge Analytica, and the firm could recommend, say, an ad-targeting strategy for Wisconsin. But a campaign official \u2014 a U.S. citizen or green-card holder \u2014 would have to approve it.\n\nNix's comment seems to acknowledge that line; he's saying the firm stayed on the right side of it.\n\n2. Did Cambridge Analytica give or sell the data to the Trump campaign?\n\nIf the answer is yes, it would raise questions.\n\nThe Trump campaign paid the firm a total of $5.9 million, according to Federal Election Commission data processed by the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics. The campaign's filings say the firm provided data management and survey research. But estimates for how much the data is worth, as processed by Cambridge Analytica, run much higher.\n\nIf the firm gave the data, or sold it at less than fair market value, the transaction would amount to a campaign contribution \u2014 a two-fer violation of the law, which bars corporations and foreign nationals from contributing.\n\n3. Did Cambridge Analytica have any other clients?\n\nJust one of note: a superPAC called Make American Number 1. During the campaign it used the name Stop Crooked Hillary PAC. As that suggests \u2014 and as Cambridge Analytica executives indicated in the Channel Four report \u2014 the superPAC served as an attack dog to supplement the campaign's messages.\n\nAccording to that report, Cambridge Analytica treated the campaign and the superPAC as a single project. This might explain why Stop Crooked Hillary PAC paid the firm almost the same sum as the campaign \u2014 $5.7 million \u2014 for its services.\n\nCampaigns and superPACs are supposed to be independent of each other. But ironically, the seemingly sleazy arrangement is within the norms of American politics. While the two political entities cannot coordinate their messages, they can hire the same vendor. It's the vendor's duty to set up two teams, walled-off from each other and legally bound to maintain the separation.\n\n4. How much trouble is Cambridge Analytica in?\n\nNothing is proven yet, or even alleged. But it's worth noting that the Justice Department has a small set of \"core prohibitions\" around campaign finance issues that it is vigilant about prosecuting. The core prohibitions include the bans on corporate contributions and on foreign contributions and expenditures, both of which could put Cambridge Analytica in the department's sights.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kelsey Snell", "body": "Congressional leaders appear to have reached a deal on a $1.3 trillion spending package ahead of a midnight Friday deadline.\n\nThe must-pass budget behemoth was still in the works Wednesday afternoon, raising the possibility of the the need for another stop-gap funding measure otherwise a partial government shutdown would occur until the bill can pass Congress. The agreement is expected to be loaded with dozens of unrelated policies aimed at wooing skeptical lawmakers to back the deal.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans each claimed victories after days of partisan bickering over what extraneous provisions, known as \"riders,\" to tuck into the bill. They ultimately agreed to include improvements to the national gun background check system.\n\nThe bill also includes nearly $1.6 billion in border security increases without addressing a legal fix for the roughly 700,000 immigrants who stand to lose protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA, according to several aides familiar with the negotiations.\n\nIt's a common \u2014 if sometimes controversial \u2014 practice used by both parties and the president to jockey for their priorities because they are guaranteed to become law on a must-pass spending bill. Adding to the negotiating pressures this round is the looming midterm election, and the reality that the political season will soon overtake any ability to advance any additional major legislation before Election Day.\n\nThe underlying spending bill, which bundles together all 12 of the individual annual appropriations bills that fund the U.S. government into what is called an \"omnibus\" bill, was largely crafted with bipartisan input from the House and Senate Appropriations Committees in recent weeks.\n\nThe bill is expected to include$2.8 billion to battle opioid addition as well as major funding increases for the Department of Veterans Affairs, federal highway projects and high speed broadband development, the aides said.\n\nThe $1.3 trillion measure includes significant boosts to U.S. military spending supported by President Trump and congressional Republicans, while Democrats secured boosts to domestic spending most Republicans oppose. The domestic spending levels under this bill are higher than any spending Democrats achieved under President Obama.\n\nOne of the final sticking points was from the White House and the president's insistence that the measure include some measure of funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. The White House initially wanted $25 billion but Democrats pushed for a far smaller amount with explicit restrictions on how the money could be spent.\n\nThe final $1.6 billion agreement will fund new fencing along roughly 30 miles of the border that was already authorized under an earlier bill. Negotiators also reached a deal to repair existing fencing while explicitly protecting the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge in Texas, according to a source familiar with the deal.\n\nSome Democrats remain frustrated that the bill does not deal with immigration. Many immigration advocates worry that DACA cannot pass if it is not included in a broader bipartisan bill.

It's winnable,\" the Democratic candidate says of the Illinois 14th Congressional District, which stretches along the western and northern sides of Chicago's outer suburbs.\n\nHer attitude is maybe unremarkable \u2014 every candidate says they're optimistic \u2014 except for the fact that the odds are stacked against her. She knows very well that this race is considered a pretty safe bet for the GOP in November \u2014 the nonpartisan Cook Political Report lists it as a \"likely Republican\" win, meaning Republican incumbent Randy Hultgren has an excellent chance of holding onto his House seat.\n\n\"We're not in an average year, and I'm not an average candidate,\" she says. \"I think that that matters. What we've seen in elections out of Virginia and Texas and the special [election] in Pennsylvania is that the candidate and the quality of the election that they're running matters a lot in the election outcome.\"\n\nUnderwood is in good company. This year's unprecedented crop of women running for office includes a glut of women running in races that, to put it mildly, will be a challenge for them to win in November.\n\nAn NPR analysis shows that the influx of women candidates, beyond being heavily Democratic, features a glut of Democratic women running in races currently considered to be easy Republican wins.\n\nIn total, 49 percent of the Democratic women running for the House, Senate, and governor, not including incumbents, are in \"likely\" or \"safe\" Republican races. On the other side, 34 percent of Republican women running as non-incumbents are in likely or safe Democratic House, Senate, or governors' races.\n\nAnd even those running for seats that are within reach for their party will still have to get through sometimes crowded primaries.\n\nThe bottom line is that a wave of female candidates is going to equal a wave of women losing in 2018.\n\nImportantly, this doesn't necessarily make women unusual, according to an NPR analysis of the FEC's total candidate dataset. That data isn't perfect \u2014 it includes some candidates who filed but never made it to the ballot, for example \u2014 but it suggests that large numbers of men, particularly Democrats, have filed in districts that would be very difficult to win. Indeed, while the number of women running has increased substantially this year, the level of women as a share of all candidates has not increased all that much.\n\nInterestingly, the districts featuring female candidates followed a similar pattern in the last midterms \u2014 with many Democratic women likewise running in solid Republican districts \u2014 according to data from March 2014 provided to NPR by both the Cook Political Report and Rutgers' Center for American Women and Politics, or CAWP.\n\nBoth parties have seen increases in female candidates this cycle, though far more of the increase has been among Democratic women, who have been energized by their dislike of President Trump, as well as cultural forces like the #MeToo movement.\n\nThe large number of Democratic female candidates in those \"solid\" and \"likely Republican\" districts may reflect that energy, as women like Underwood hope to unseat staunch conservatives.\n\nTo be clear, the candidate field will narrow considerably in the primaries. Right now, according to the Rutgers data, there are 555 women in the running for 324 U.S. House, Senate or governors' races \u2014 a figure that includes incumbents, challengers and candidates in open races.\n\nBut in November, that wave of women will face its real numbers test.\n\nHow many women could be elected?\n\nOne way to look at the data: If a woman won every possible House race this November, women would occupy 264 House seats \u2014 well over half, and a roughly 150 percent bump from the current level of 106.\n\nBut take out all of those Democratic women in races that Cook considers \"solid\" or \"likely\" Republican and Republican women in \"solid\" or \"likely Democratic\" races, and there would be a potential 162 female House members. And that's potential \u2014 assuming all of those women won.\n\nTo be clear, this still gives women \u2014 particularly Democratic women \u2014 a good chance of picking up significant numbers of seats in November.\n\nToss-up races are one opportunity for this to happen. One easily overshadowed figure in the above charts is the number of women in toss-up races this year \u2014 twice as many GOP women as in 2014, and more than five times as many Democratic women.\n\nSome women will lose, though. And that's OK with Erin Vilardi, founder and CEO of VoteRunLead, a nonpartisan group that recruits and trains women to run for office. She says her group is \"coaching women to run to lose\" for a few reasons.\n\n\"One, you might actually win, because this is such a crazy election cycle in 2018,\" Vilardi says. \"No political pundit knows what voter turnout is going to be. Is it going to be 16 points higher [than the last mid-term election]? Eight points higher? Five points higher? We have no idea.\"\n\nIn addition, Vilardi says, a first-time candidate's 2018 campaign could teach them about fundraising and campaigning, not to mention giving them more name recognition, setting them up for an easier campaign in 2020.\n\nRunning a strong campaign in 2018 could also get a candidate more respect and power within her party in advance of future elections, Vilardi adds.\n\n\"Maybe it's also that you go to the party and say, 'If we had 12 people running in this race,' or 'If we had a ticket up and down,' or 'If we had been tending to the Latino population in this community,' or 'I registered 15,000 new Latinos as a part of this campaign' \u2014 those people are only voting for you. You're bringing that body of people with you,\" she says.\n\nOn top of all that, Vilardi adds, new candidates can give more visibility to otherwise ignored issues.\n\nFor now, Underwood has other things on her mind than the long game. She faces off against six other candidates on Tuesday (all of them men) for the Democratic nomination. She knows she's a strong candidate, having outraised all of her opponents who have filed fundraising reports combined, according to FEC data. But she does know that, if she wins, she'll have a much tougher race to run.\n\n\"We're going to need to raise two million dollars in the general,\" she says. \"This will be a challenge.

On average, they are held 13 months after being picked up for things as minor as joyriding.\n\n\"Immigration officials are authorized to detain certain aliens in the course of immigration proceedings while they determine whether those aliens may be lawfully present in the country,\" the court writes in the first line of the majority opinion, penned by Justice Alito and joined by the court's conservatives in what was a 5-3 opinion.

Immigrant advocates contend that many of these immigrants have a right to be free on bail until their case is heard.\n\nThe lead plaintiff in the case is a legal permanent resident, Alejandro Rodriguez, who came to the U.S. as a child and worked as a dental assistant. As a teenager, he was convicted for joyriding, and at 24, he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance.\n\nRodriguez was detained for three years without the right to appear before a judge to ask for bond.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union took up Rodriguez' case. The civil-rights group filed a class action lawsuit and eventually won his release and the cancellation of his deportation order. Rodriguez remains in the United States.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the immigrant detainees and asylum seekers can't be detained indefinitely and that they have a right to a bond hearing every six months. The appellate court also held that, in order to hold these detainees, the government must show the immigrants would pose a danger or become a flight risk if set free.\n\nThe Obama administration appealed to the high court, insisting that Congress \u2014 not the courts \u2014 has the power to make immigration law and that the law allows the government to detain \"criminal and terrorist aliens\" as well as \"aliens seeking admission to the United States.\"\n\nThe administration also argued that detained immigrants should not be recognized as a class that could bring legal action.

If you don't pick this fight, we might as well not be here.

They arrived as Washington's closest ally, Britain, is locked in a diplomatic struggle with Moscow after accusing the Kremlin of using a nerve agent to poison a former Russian intelligence officer living in the United Kingdom.\n\nTrump also joined the leaders of the U.K., France and Germany on Thursday in issuing a statement that condemned the poisoning attack.\n\nAmong the Russians sanctioned by the U.S. on Thursday are 13 people and three entities, including the Internet Research Agency, indicted by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller for their alleged role in Moscow's influence operation during the 2016 campaign.\n\nTrump has repeatedly questioned whether Russia did indeed interfere in the election, despite the assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies that the Kremlin carried out a sweeping influence operation and propaganda campaign.\n\nLately, however, he has changed his tune and accepted that the active measures took place.

Doug Jones delivered his maiden speech on the Senate floor on Wednesday, tackling a topic that would seem anathema to most Southern Democrats \u2014 gun control.\n\nJones, who was elected in a special election upset last December, called for universal background checks, raising the age for purchasing semi-automatic weapons to 21 and eliminating key loopholes that could allow a gun to fall into dangerous hands.\n\n\"In the wake of yet another mass shooting, and the rising voices of young people across the country, it is our responsibility \u2013 our duty \u2013 to have a serious discussion about guns and gun safety,\" Jones said. \"But that conversation has to be two-fold: We must acknowledge the deadly consequences that can follow when a gun is in the wrong hands, but also recognize and respect the freedom to own and enjoy guns by law-abiding citizens as guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the Constitution. Those two concepts are not mutually exclusive.\"\n\nJones nodded to his own background as a gun-owning hunting enthusiast, and talked about how he's shared that love with his son. He also shied away from completely vilifying the National Rifle Association, which has resisted many of the proposals he and other legislators have put forward. President Trump initially seemed open to more drastic gun control measures in a bipartisan meeting earlier this month, but later backed off and has endorsed arming some school personnel, among other measures backed by the NRA.\n\nBut, Jones argued, ultimately the government's commitment to the safety of its citizens must be paramount. And while he said that some of the actions undertaken recently are positive \u2014 moving to ban bump stocks that can convert guns into automatic-style weapons, efforts to strengthen the background check system \u2014 Jones also said it's not enough. He proposed making background checks universal, including on internet sales, at gun shows and even private sales, as well as implementing three-day waiting periods.\n\n\"So while I know that guns and gun control are difficult issues for this country, I can tell you they're complicated for me, too. But as a United States Senator today, a member of the legislative branch of government, I have many obligations.

Yet, on many levels, we fail our children and grandchildren every morning when we pack their backpacks and send them into harm's way.\"\n\nJones said that, for him, the deadly shooting last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 people was a \"tipping point regarding gun violence.\" That's spurred a school walkout last week and a protest, \"March For Our Lives,\" this coming Saturday in Washington, D.C., and around the country.\n\nA former federal prosecutor, Jones also said the activism spurred by this protest shooting reminded him of the civil rights movement and made him reflect on one his most famous case \u2014 finally bringing to justice Ku Klux Klansmen who had bombed a Birmingham church in 1963 that killed four African-American girls.\n\n\"With the convictions of two former Klansmen for the murder of those four young girls, that longed-for tidal wave of justice rose up, and hope and history rhymed in Birmingham,\" Jones recalled. \"And for me, and I hope for you, when I walk the halls of the Senate office buildings, and come through those double doors onto the Senate floor, I realize that every day we as a collective body have that same opportunity. Whether it is for DREAMers, or voting rights, or victims of sex trafficking, or in this case, our children who are demanding action on gun violence, we have the opportunity to build that tidal wave of justice and have hope and history rhyme.\"\n\nBut, Jones said, in order to do so it requires \"courage to seize this moment,\" to work across the aisle and find common ground, tamp down on divisive political rhetoric and be unafraid to do the right thing, no matter the political consequences \u2014 something that rings especially true for Jones, as he faces re-election in 2020 in a deep red state.\n\n\"We could spend days in this chamber debating the meaning and intent of the Second Amendment.

We can be reasonable here because we all want the same thing: a safer country, a safer world. At its core, the Second Amendment was an effort to protect Americans.

Appointed by President George W. Bush, Mueller took over as director of the FBI one week before the Sept. 11 attacks. After Mueller completed his 10-year term as FBI director, President Obama re-appointed him for a special two-year term, which required a special act of Congress.\n\n\"Bob Mueller is probably about as apolitical and nonpartisan a figure as you could find in Washington, particularly at the levels of government in which he has served,\" Graff says. \"This is someone who really, truly believes in truth, justice [and] in the American way, in a way that very few people in American life today anymore do.\"\n\nWe know him most recently, obviously, as the FBI director, but his tenure in government really dates back to the Reagan years. And he's been appointed or held top jobs in the administrations of all five of the last presidents, and was appointed to the Justice Department, the head of the criminal division, under George H.W. Bush's administration, then was appointed a U.S. attorney by Bill Clinton, then appointed the acting deputy attorney general by George W. Bush, and then later FBI director \u2014 a position he was re-appointed to, in an unprecedented move, by President Obama and confirmed by the U.S. Senate by a vote 100 to 0, a stunningly bipartisan track record in today's times.\n\nPart of what makes Bob Mueller such a fascinating character is he has dedicated his life sort of time and again to public service. ... Mueller and a handful of other colleagues ... [signed] up for Vietnam after college. This was early in the 1960s so it was before Vietnam became the cultural touchpoint that it did later.\n\nSecond Lt. Marine Corps Bob Mueller ended up leading a platoon in the jungles of Vietnam for a year, and really distinguished himself in combat. He received a bronze star with valor for his leadership in an ambush that his unit suffered in the fall of 1968, and then was actually shot himself in a separate incident in April 1969 where he received, of course, the Purple Heart and was quickly back on patrol and served out the remainder of his year.\n\nOn how the FBI changed after the Sept. 11 attacks\n\nBob Mueller, in the days after Sept. 11, sees this incredible sea change in the mission of the FBI, which until then for most of its first 90 years had primarily been a law enforcement agency focused domestically on solving crimes after the fact. And on Sept. 11, we saw an international plot that focused on a suicide attack with catastrophic results, and that that necessitated this top-to-bottom change in the way that the United States approached counterterrorism issues, that after the fact investigation was going to be inadequate in the face of these threats.\n\nSo Mueller was given a mission by [former Attorney General] John Ashcroft and President Bush to not just investigate attacks afterwards, but to stop plots in the first place, to disrupt the attack before it happened.\n\nIt led to this massive reorganization that Bob Mueller spent the next 12 years of his tenure working on, to move the FBI from what was traditionally a domestic law enforcement agency into something that is more akin to an international intelligence agency.\n\nOn how Mueller's investigation into the Trump campaign is similar to other FBI investigations\n\nThis is, in many ways, a perfectly standard and routine FBI investigation. The FBI, as an investigative agency, takes down corrupt organizations, that's what it's designed to do, go after street gangs, drug cartels, organized crime families, and the way that they do that is by starting on the outside and working their way in. And so that can either mean starting at the bottom of an organization, or starting with ancillary charges and working their way inwards, the equivalent of getting Al Capone for tax evasion.\n\nSo you've seen this investigation both where Mueller has started almost literally at the bottom with George Papadopoulos and pressured him to cooperate on people above, and also in the charges against Paul Manafort, which are sort of ancillary to the core question of the behavior of the Trump campaign. He's sort of first charged this decade-long alleged money laundering scheme dating back through some sort of unrelated work, again as a pressure point on Paul Manafort and Rick Gates. ...\n\nWe speak of the Mueller probe as if it is one thing, but it's actually this whole panoply of different investigations into different threads of the Trump campaign, the 2016 presidential election and the involvement of Russia. There's sort of some money-laundering aspects to it, there's some campaign aspects to it, we've seen him go after and get documents from Facebook, other social media sites, Cambridge Analytica, the campaign data team. There's all sorts of different threads of this investigation that are being followed, and we know that Bob Mueller is going to be incredibly tenacious in that investigation but that he's also not going on a fishing expedition.\n\nOn what might happen to the investigation into the Trump campaign if Mueller is fired\n\nThis was an investigation that began before Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel. Remember, actually, the guilty pleas of George Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn both stem from lies that they told to FBI agents months before Robert Mueller stepped into this probe.\n\nAnd so those investigators would presumably continue investigating, and there might even be a new special counsel appointed who steps in, and even if that's not true, and the special counsel's office is disbanded entirely, the prosecution of those open investigations would likely transfer back to the U.S. Attorney's office in D.C. or the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, in Alexandria, Va., and that those investigations might just continue apace absent a special counsel.\n\nPeople forget, or don't know, when you open an FBI investigation that's actually a very formal process that goes through several different stages of an investigation before you end up with what's known as a \"full field\" investigation, and by the time you get there you have to have shown evidence of a potential criminal act in order to get to that formal \"OK\" to continue an investigation.\n\nAnd similarly, there's a formal process to shut down an investigation that requires prosecutors to review the evidence with agents and to decline an investigation and charges. This is not something that's quite as simple as, \"If Bob Mueller is fired, he walks out the door, locks the office behind him and everything just disappears into the ether.\"\n\nSam Briger and Mooj Zadie produced and edited the audio of this interview.

The prosecutor who replaced Cox built on that work, ultimately leading to Nixon's resignation.\n \nGormley said the current special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, is operating in that same mold.\n \nBut at the White House, President Trump and his lawyers have been pressing the Mueller team to move even faster. So is another familiar figure: former Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr.\n \n\"The American people, I think, want to know, was there collusion,\" Starr told CNN last week. \"Let's get that answered. That would be my sense, if I were at the Justice Department.\"\n \nStarr, of course, spent five years and more than $40 million investigating President Bill Clinton. Critics say Starr took too long and wandered away from his original mission. He was far from the only independent counsel to come under attack as a \"roving Frankenstein monster,\" Gormley said.\n \nIn the category of \"no end,\" there was the investigation of Clinton's secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Henry Cisneros. In 1995, then-Attorney General Janet Reno asked for an independent counsel to determine whether Cisneros should face prosecution for providing false information about payments to a former mistress.\n \n\"I'm disappointed by that outcome but I'm hopeful that the investigation will be completed expeditiously,\" Cisneros told reporters at the time.\n \nBut any hope Cisneros had for a speedy resolution went bust. The independent counsel in his case, David Barrett, kept working even after the law authorizing his work expired. Cisneros pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was later pardoned by the president. Still, Barrett's work continued. The final report emerged in 2006, nearly 11 years after he took office.\n \nRobert Mueller is a hard-driving former FBI director, not known for dallying in his work. He's already secured indictments against Russians for running an information warfare campaign aimed at the last presidential election.\n \nAnd yet, Wake Forest University professor Katy Harriger said measuring Mueller's success will be a challenge.\n \n\"For some people, success will only be if somehow the president gets impeached,\" Harriger said. \"And for other people, success is a complete exoneration.\"\n \nPush away that cloud of politics, she said, and success may be a report or a set of conclusions that most people can believe.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Scott Detrow", "body": "A little after 10 o'clock Wednesday morning, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi began a one-minute speech on the House floor.\n\nMore than six hours later, she's still going.\n\nPelosi's marathon Senate filibuster-style speech is a protest against the fact that negotiations over the future of the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program have stalled out.\n\n\"Our Dreamers hang in limbo, with a cruel cloud of fear and uncertainty above them.

He grew up in a good family and learned in school to speak two foreign languages \u2014 English and Arabic. \"I kept thinking, I'm a human being, just like him,\" he says, comparing himself to a man in Libya he says enslaved him. \n   Mohammed fled Niger when he was just 17 years old, when extremist Boko Haram militants came to his area. He paid smugglers to take him across North Africa and to Europe, but when they reached Libya, he and other migrants were detained by a Libyan militia. \n   \"My mistake was that I came to this country [Libya],\" he says. \n   There began a three-year ordeal that saw him thrown into prison, held for ransom, and bought and sold into bonded labor or debt slavery. \n   Mohammed is now 20. He looks haunted by his time in Libya, and asks not to use his last name, afraid that the militia that caught him in Libya might find him in southern Tunisia, where he now lives. \n   \n    \n\n    \n\n   Testimonies like Mohammed's, recorded by NPR, suggest a pattern of slave-trade abuses of migrants detained in Libya. The conflict-riven country is a final stopover for many people from across Africa and parts of Asia taking long, risky journeys for refuge in Italy or onward in Europe.  \n   Italy has sought to reduce the number of arrivals by financing and training Libyan authorities to stop the migration, even as rights experts decry inhumane conditions for asylum-seekers in the North African country. \n   On Wednesday, the United Nations human rights office reported that migrants in Libya have been bought and sold at \"open slave markets.\" \n   Now, some migrants who escaped are speaking out and detailing harrowing experiences. \n   NPR met Mohammed through Mongi Slim, the southern Tunisia director for the Red Crescent aid group, which is sheltering hundreds of migrants who arrive from neighboring Libya. \n   \n            \n\n    \n        \n            \n                Mohammed works in an olive grove in southern Tunisia after he escaped from slavery in Libya.

He's long been familiar with the mistreatment of migrants by human traffickers, smugglers and militias in Libya. \n   Libya still reels from its civil war in 2011. Rival governments in the east and the west wrestle for power, and militias run the streets. \n   But since mid-2016, Slim says, more and more migrants have arrived bringing testimony of being traded as commodities and being sold into slavery. \"At first, I was a bit skeptical. If just one person comes with this story, of course you are not sure if it's truth. But then when so many people came and told us the same thing, it became more clear,\" Slim says. \n   Late last year, a CNN investigation revealed footage of what appears to be African migrants being auctioned off. In the video, an auctioneer sells men he describes as \"big strong boys\" to the highest bidder. \n   The footage caused international outrage. In December, the United Nations Security Council condemned the reported acts of slavery in Libya as \"heinous abuses\" and called \"for those responsible to be held to account.\" \n   In southern Tunisia, Slim says he started hearing accounts of slavery long before they came to light in international media. \n   Most of the men and women at the Red Crescent shelter come from African countries. Slim introduced NPR to migrants from Gambia, Nigeria and Senegal. They sleep on foam mattresses on a concrete floor, several to a room. \n   Five young men want to discuss their experiences. They didn't witness the secret slave auctions reported by CNN, although they say they have heard of those. Instead, they describe Libya's detention centers \u2014 a network of prisons, some of them sanctioned by the state as part of an effort to combat illegal immigration \u2014 as being the very places where migrants are \"bought\" and \"sold.\" \n   Boubaker Nassou, a 30-year-old from Gambia, describes the detention center where he was held as a \"slave market\" and as the \"prison where they sell people.\" \n   Like Mohammed, from Niger, the smugglers' car that Nassou rode in was detained by a militia once he crossed into Libya. The migrants were bundled into another vehicle, and he says they were taken \"straight to the prison where they sell people.\" \n   It was a large, dank room, crammed full of African men and women. Nassou says he barely had space to sit or lie on the concrete floor. It was hot and no one was allowed to shower; the air was putrid. \n   And all the while, Nassou says, Libyans would come to haggle with the guards. What they were haggling over was the price for prisoners. He says a \"business\" has developed of buying migrants out of one detention center and selling them to another for profit. \n   \n            \n\n    \n        \n            \n                Boubaker Nassou describes the prisons where he was held in Libya as \"slave markets.\" He was repeatedly bought and sold into and out of these prisons before being taken into bonded labour. Now he lives in a shelter run by the Tunisian Red Crescent.\n                \n                \n                    \n                    Ruth Sherlock/NPR\n                    \n                \n                hide caption\n            \n\n        \n\n\n\n            toggle caption\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n        Ruth Sherlock/NPR\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Boubaker Nassou describes the prisons where he was held in Libya as \"slave markets.\" He was repeatedly bought and sold into and out of these prisons before being taken into bonded labour. Now he lives in a shelter run by the Tunisian Red Crescent.\n\n        \n            \n            Ruth Sherlock/NPR\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n   \n\n   \"This man would come and say 'I need one person,' and they say, 'This one is 400 Libyan dinar.' 'This one is 500.' 'This one is for 300' and 'this one is for 200.' They sell you and buy you like that,\" Nassou said. (In U.S. dollars, that's a range of about $150 to $350.) \n   Shortly after he was detained and thrown in detention, in 2016, Nassou says he was bought by a Libyan man for 500 Libyan dinars \u2014 the equivalent of $350. \n   He doesn't know the man's name; in the prison, he says he was taught to just refer to every Libyan he met as mudir, Arabic for \"boss.\" \n   He says the man moved him to another detention center, and sold him to the guards for three times the price. \n   These accounts are consistent with some of the reporting by humanitarian and rights organizations on the mistreatment of migrants in Libyan detention centers. \n   A report by the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration in 2017 also documented what it called \"slave market conditions\" for migrants in Libya. The report included testimony similar to Nassou's, of migrants being bought and sold for profit between militias and detention centers. \n   An Amnesty International report published in December estimates there are over 20,000 refugees and migrants currently being held in official detention centers that are \u2014 in theory \u2014 run by the Libyan Interior Ministry's Department of Combating Illegal Migration. \n   \"There are 33 official detention centers under the DCIM,\" said Marwa Mohamed, a researcher for the Amnesty International report, using the department's acronym. \"But the DCIM has nominal control over them. They are in fact run by militias in certain areas and there's very little oversight.\" \n   Thousands more migrants are being held in places run by criminal gangs, separate from the government based in the capital Tripoli. But, Mohamed says, human rights abuses are happening in both types of places. \n   Libyan law has few provisions for asylum-seekers or protections for victims of human trafficking. It criminalizes irregular entry and punishes undocumented immigrants with fines or jail while they wait to be deported. \n   The Amnesty International report, which is based on interviews with dozens of migrants, says that prison guards extort the inmates and demand ransom from their relatives. In some cases, guards will torture a prisoner so that their loved one can hear their screams on the phone. \n   When they can't extract payment, the report says, there are cases where the prisoners are sold into bonded labor, a form of modern slavery. Someone will come and pay the prison to free an inmate, but from that moment the prisoner is beholden to the person who paid for their release. Often they are forced to work off the debt. \n   \"Everyone who gets out of these detention centers has either somehow miraculously escaped, has been sold, or has to pay a fee \u2014 a large ransom \u2014 in order to get out. These are your options,\" the researcher Mohamed says. \n   An official in the Tripoli government declined NPR's request to comment on the treatment of migrants in Libya. \n   Libyan authorities have called for investigations into the sale of migrants. And in recent months the immigration department that oversees the detention centers has taken steps to close down centers where abuses happen, according to Amnesty International. \n   Nonetheless, migrants say the abuse \u2014 and selling \u2014 of migrants in Libya remains prevalent. \n   In its report, Amnesty also accused Europe of continuing to \"outsource border control to Libya\" despite the horrors suffered by migrants there. \n   Several migrants in the Tunisian shelter describe experiences of being sold into bonded labor in Libya. \n   \n            \n\n    \n        \n            \n                Boubacker Nassou (third from left) lives in a shelter run by the Tunisian Red Crescent aid group that houses men who fled from Libya.

Mohammed, from Niger, says the Libyan who bought him from a prison was in fact paying his ransom that had been set for him by guards. \"He paid the amount of money, which means, he had bought a slave,\" he said. \n   But Mohammed says, there was no contract, no promise of how long he'd have to work before he could have his freedom. \n   \"If you're not Libyan they don't think you're human. You're an animal in their eyes,\" he says, rage flashing across his face. \n   Sometimes the farmer would give him food, sometimes he wouldn't, says Mohammed. The way he was treated depended a lot on the farmer's mood. \"You know, sometimes, he would [be] happy and sometimes he would be sad,\" Mohammed says. \"When he was happy, he would share his happiness with me.\" \n   \"And when he was down...\" his voice trails off. He later describes being beaten, and given only scraps of food to eat. \n   One time, he says, he built up the courage to ask the farmer for payment for his work. \"I asked how he was OK with not giving me what was rightfully mine,\" he says. The farmer's answer was to pull out a gun and shoot, narrowly missing him. \n   Mohammed slept in the dirt outside the farmer's home. The farm was set in a remote scrubland far from any other settlements. But at night he could make out headlights twinkling faintly in the distance. \n   \"They were far away but you could see them,\" he says. One night after seven months of captivity, Mohammed says he had enough. \"I got fed up with the hunger and the exhaustion and the beatings and the sickness. I didn't have a watch, but it must have been around 2 to 2:30 in the morning. Everyone was asleep. I ran.\" He sprinted for three hours to reach the road he'd seen from so far away and hitched a lift to the capital Tripoli. \n   Eventually Mohammed managed to earn enough money from odd jobs to pay smugglers to escape the country. He boarded a small, overcrowded boat that broke down in the Mediterranean Sea. He was rescued by the Libyan coast guard, which brought him to Slim from the Red Crescent. \n   Slim says he tries to help the migrants as he can. He found Mohammed a job as an olive picker in a grove not far from Zarzis, a town on Tunisia's southeastern coast. \n   He's still extremely poor. He sleeps on a foam mattress in a tiny, dark and empty concrete room. But in comparison to what he's been through in Libya, he says, abject poverty is a small problem: \"Here the work is little, and the money is bad.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., joined other Republicans in highlighting the military spending increases.\n   \"With the biggest increase in defense funding in 15 years,\" Ryan said in a statement. \"This critical legislation begins to reverse the damage of the last decade and allows us to create a 21st-century fighting force.\"\n   He is working to tamp down anger among conservatives over spending increase and changes to gun policy.

Many immigration advocates are angry that the legislation includes $1.6 billion in border security money without corresponding protections for immigrants currently protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program.\n   Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-NY, focused instead on spending increases for domestic programs.\n   \"Every bill takes compromise, and there was plenty here, but at the end of the day we Democrats feel very good because so many of our priorities for the middle class were included,\" Schumer said. \"From opioid funding to rural broadband, and from student loans to child care, this bill puts workers and families first.\"\n   \n   The agreement is loaded with dozens of unrelated policies, known as \"riders,\" ranging from gun control to election security aimed at wooing skeptical lawmakers to back the deal.\n   Adding riders is a common \u2014 if sometimes controversial \u2014 practice used by both parties and the president to jockey for their priorities because they are guaranteed to become law on a must-pass spending bill.\n   The fight over border security and immigration became a major drag on negotiations in recent weeks with both sides refusing to negotiate.\n   The White House initially wanted $25 billion, but Democrats pushed for a far smaller amount with explicit restrictions on how the money could be spent.\n   The final $1.6 billion agreement would fund new fencing along roughly 30 miles of the border that was authorized under an earlier bill. Negotiators also reached a deal to repair existing fencing while explicitly protecting the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge in Texas.\n   \n   \n\n   The bill also includes nearly $700 million for election security, including additional money for the FBI to conduct counter-intelligence to fight Russian cyber attacks. States would benefit from an infusion of money for election technology grants to keep elections systems safe.\n   Negotiators included several bipartisan items, like $2.8 billion to battle opioid addiction as well as major funding increases for the Department of Veterans Affairs, federal highway projects and high-speed broadband development.\n   But what isn't included is nearly as significant as what made it in the bill.\n   The spending measure is widely expected to be one of the last must-pass bills to come up for a vote this year, meaning immigration has few opportunities for consideration in the coming months.\n   Looming midterm election and the reality that the political season will soon overtake any ability to advance any major legislation before Election Day.\n   \n   \n\n   Democrats remain frustrated that the bill does not deal with immigration.

But you wouldn't expect to be thrown in jail for it.\n\nThat's exactly what happened to Fane Lozman at a city council meeting in Florida.\n\nOn Tuesday, that arrest gets to the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 and could have broader implications than just for Lozman but for the limits of First Amendment protections of freedom of speech.\n\nOddly, it's not Lozman's first trip to the nation's highest court. Five years ago, the financial trader won his first case against the City of Riviera Beach when the city seized his floating home to make room for a harbor redevelopment. Today's case could affect a lot more people.\n\nBack in 2006, Lozman was not exactly a welcome sight for the Riviera Beach City Council. He had managed to scuttle their plans to convert the local public marina into a private one.\n\nA transcript of a closed-door meeting in June of that year shows council members discussing tactics for dealing with Lozman, including the possibility of hiring a private investigator to turn the tables on the city's critic.\n\n\"I think it would help to intimidate,\" Council Chairperson Elizabeth Wade said, adding, \"I think they should be questioned by some of our people ... so they can feel the same kind of unwarranted heat.\"\n\nOn Nov. 15, 2006, the dispute between Lozman and the city council boiled over. During the public comment portion of an open meeting, Lozman decided to speak up.\n\n\"They were not in a very good mood,\" he recalls. \"They realized they had to abandon their entire redevelopment plan. ... They were throwing in the towel that night, and that's when I got up to make my public comment, and the chairperson was just livid looking at me.\"\n\nLozman started out, \"You're probably aware that the U.S. Attorney's office has arrested the second corrupt local politician. This time it was former Palm Beach County Commissioner Tony Masilotti.\"\n\nChairperson Wade immediately interrupted him. \"Fane Lozman, you have the right to say what you want to say publicly, but you will not stand up and go through that.\"\n\nLozman stuck to his guns, insisting that he had the right to speak. Wade summoned the police officer on duty to the podium and told Lozman to leave or be arrested.\n\nWhen Lozman refused to leave, Wade told the officer to \"carry him out.\"\n\nThe officer handcuffed Lozman at the podium and took him to a holding cell at the local police department, charging him with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.\n\nA video of the whole episode can be viewed on YouTube:\n\nThe charges were subsequently dropped, but Lozman continued to fume. He sued the city, alleging a number of retaliatory acts, including his arrest at the council meeting.\n\nA jury, though, sided with the city.\n\nA federal appeals court upheld the verdict, concluding there was probable cause to believe that Lozman was violating or was about to violate a Florida law that makes it a second-degree misdemeanor to disturb a lawful assembly.\n\nLozman hotly disputes that characterization of his conduct.\n\n\"I did maintain order,\" he said. \"Disorderly conduct relative to a public meeting is if you go beyond your 3 minutes, if you use profanity, if you're screaming or yelling. I was doing none of those.\"\n\nHe maintains instead that what the council chairperson objected to was the content of his speech.\n\n\"If she didn't want to listen to that content, she shouldn't run for public office,\" he said, \"because the First Amendment protects comments that are critical and maybe comments people don't like to hear.\"\n\nLozman added that this Supreme Court case is far more important than his last one.\n\n\"If I lose, then police and municipalities and the final policymakers who run the city, they're immunized,\" Lozman said. \"They can just come up with any bogus misdemeanor arrest to remove you from making your public comments.\"\n\nAs the briefs in the case indicate, Lozman's experience is hardly unique.\n\nIndeed, more than two dozen media organizations have filed a brief pointing to similar problems encountered by reporters and photographers engaged in everything from investigative journalism to covering demonstrations.\n\nWhile arresting journalists for critical coverage may be the hallmark of repressive regimes, and rarely happen in the United States, the brief observes, \"It does happen.\"\n\nThe brief, points, for instance, to Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio's arrest of the publishers of the Phoenix New Times for publishing articles that probed the sheriff's commercial real-estate holdings.\n\nThe City of Riviera Beach declined NPR's request to discuss its case, but in written briefs filed with the court, the city council, backed by the Trump administration, contends that the police officer was justified in arresting Lozman, even if Lozman's speech was perfectly legal.\n\nThe city argues that in the context of law enforcement, an open-ended right to sue for false arrest would be chaotic, expensive for municipalities and dangerous.\n\nConsider this example, the city argues: a police officer sees someone illegally driving a van through the parking lot of a federal building with a sign that says, \"Remember the Children of Waco.\"\n\nThe police officer might reasonably decide to arrest the driver, rather than just issue a citation, thus buying time to determine whether the driver is a concerned citizen or another Oklahoma City bomber.\n\nLozman's lawyers, in their briefs, counter that the defendant here isn't the individual policeman, it's the city. The arrest did not occur in the field, but occurred while Lozman was \"calmly speaking during the public comment portion of a city council meeting,\" and that what he said \"provided no basis for the arrest.\"\n\nA decision in the case is expected by summer.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kelsey Snell", "body": "Lawmakers went to the White House Wednesday looking for guidance from President Trump on gun legislation.

Even many Republicans responded to the White House meeting with confusion and frustration over the lack of clear guidance from the president.\n\nOver the course of the hour-long broadcast Trump seemed to embrace plans to expand background checks and increase age limits for purchasing long gun rifles, positions that generally anathema to congressional Republicans.

Tim Murphy, R-Penn., resigned last year amid a sex scandal. Republicans have privately grumbled that their candidate has been lackluster, and the Democrat could be poised to pull off the upset. Polls will close at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nIf Lamb is victorious, it would be the highest-profile warning yet against the GOP ahead of this November's midterm elections. Not only will Democrats have finally flipped a GOP House seat in a special election, but the win would come in a solidly red area and underscore just how little help Trump might provide the party this fall. And that could trigger even more GOP legislators to head for the exits, adding to an already record number of House Republican incumbents retiring.\n\nTrump visited the district for a rally on Saturday as a last-ditch rescue mission, where he asked his supporters, \"Do me a favor. Get out on Tuesday and vote for Rick Saccone.\" Trump also referred to the Democrat as \"Lamb the sham,\" saying that if elected, Lamb would vote as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wants, even though the candidate said he would not support keeping her as leader of the Democratic caucus.\n\nThe president's visit capped off a massive effort by GOP groups to keep the seat in Republican hands. More than $10 million has been spent to support Saccone, about twice as much as has been spent for Lamb. That massive expenditure is despite the fact that the district won't even exist in its current form come November due to court-ordered redistricting, underscoring just how desperate Republicans are to avoid an embarrassing loss that would portend a growing blue wave.\n\nIt would also show that the GOP's economic argument to voters and touting their tax cuts may not be enough to save them at the ballot box, either. While early ads focused on a fiscal message, closing arguments from Republican outside groups hit Lamb on immigration and crime instead.\n\nLamb had outside support in the final days from former Vice President Joe Biden, a Pennsylvania native. The young former prosecutor and Marine veteran has honed in on local issues and eschewed most national help, and even Republicans concede he's been an unusually tough candidate.\n\nIf Saccone wins, President Trump would get credit for juicing Republican turnout in the final days.\n\nData in the last week of the race backed up assertions from the district that Saccone's fundraising was weak. Of the more than $10 million spent to support his campaign, less than 10 percent was from the Saccone campaign itself. On the Democratic side, about two-thirds of the money spent to support Lamb came from his campaign.\n\nOne byproduct of all that money and the television ads that have blanketed the Pittsburgh media market in recent weeks is a lot of confused voters. Pittsburgh public radio station WESA is reporting that election officials in Allegheny County have fielded calls all day from angry would-be voters wanting to know why their polling place was closed. The answer: These people didn't live in the 18th congressional district.\n\nIn Virginia and in special state-level races around the country over the past year, suburban voters motivated by anti-Trump sentiments have shown up in droves to vote for Democrats. One key question is whether or not that happens again tonight.\n\nRepublican operatives are particularly interested in the early results from Upper St. Clair, a high-income, high-education Pittsburgh suburb that traditionally votes Republican. \"If Lamb wins there, it's over,\" said one longtime Pittsburgh GOP strategist. Bethel Park is another high-income suburb to track for similar trends.\n\nWith a strong push from unions like the AFL-CIO and the United Mine Workers of America, Lamb is also attempting to cut into the wide margins that Republican congressional candidates typically rack up in the district's rural corners, too. Greene County, in the southern end of the 18th, broke for Trump by 40 points in 2016, but Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald told NPR that recent polls showed the two candidates neck-and-neck. If counties like Greene and Washington are near-even, then Lamb would have a clear shot to win.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jessica Taylor", "body": "Trump Backs Conflicting Gun Measures While Negotiating With Lawmakers On TV\n\nIn a freewheeling meeting with lawmakers on efforts to curtail gun violence, President Trump appeared to throw his support behind a number of conflicting measures, including some that are opposed by the powerful gun lobby.\n\nDuring the gathering at the White House of both GOP and Democratic lawmakers, the president showed an openness to expanding background checks, possibly raising the age to purchase AR-15 rifles and also overriding due process, if necessary, in order to take guns away from mentally ill people or those who had been red-flagged as potential dangers, as the admitted shooter in Parkland, Fla., two weeks ago had been.\n\nTrump bluntly told GOP lawmakers that any effort to include a concealed carry reciprocity measure with a gun bill would effective sink its changes \u2014 which is due to firm opposition from Senate Democrats. But there were other moments where the president showed a naivite of the lawmaking process, suggesting that it would be easy to get 60 votes for a bill to pass the Senate, suggesting merging some incompatible ideas and chiding lawmakers for being too beholden to the National Rifle Association \u2014 a group from which he's enjoyed broad support and remains particularly chummy with its leaders.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, told reporters the White House meeting did little to advance the debate in Congress over legislation aimed at curbing gun violence. \"It's still unclear to me what can actually pass, and my experience is these things are harder to do than they sound. So I think we'll sleep on it and see where we are tomorrow,\" he said.\n\nThe president repeatedly challenged long-standing GOP orthodoxy on gun policy in today's meeting, leaving legislators bewildered by what happens next and what, precisely, Trump actually supports.\n\n\"I think everybody is trying to absorb what we just heard,\" Cornyn said. \"He's a unique president and I think if he was focused on a specific piece of legislation rather than a grab bag of ideas than I think he could have a lot of influence, but right now we don't have that.\"\n\nTrump underscored that he wants a bill that will address many issues he believes has contributed to mass shootings over the past few decades, ranging from background check loopholes to mental health legislation.\n\n\"We can really get there but we have to do it,\" Trump said at the outset of the meeting.\n\nThere are two major bipartisan bills the president seized upon, and even suggested that they could be merged. First, he voiced support the effort by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., which failed in 2013 in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, that would have expanded background checks.\n\nTrump expressed disbelief that such a bill didn't pass after such a devastating attack that killed 20 young children and six adults. And chided that one reason it failed was because then-President Obama didn't sufficiently support it \u2014 despite the fact that the Democrat spent considerable time and political capital to back its passage, calling it \"a pretty shameful day for Washington\" when it fell just six votes short of the 60 votes needed to advance in the Senate.\n\nTrump asked what the bill did to address raising the age from 18 to 21 for some firearm purchases like AR-15s which have been used in several deadly shootings. Toomey responded that it didn't currently address it, to which Trump retorted that it was because \"you're afraid of the NRA.\"\n\nThe second bill Trump signaled his support for is the \"Fix NICS\" bill proposed by Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Chris Murphy, D-Conn., which would improve reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System which they hope will flag people who shouldn't be able to purchase guns.\n\nMurphy, who has been a leading voice for gun control especially after the 2012 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn., complained that they haven't been able to get anywhere significant in the past few years because \"the gun lobby has a veto power.\"\n\n\"If all we end up doing is the stuff that the gun industry supports, then this just isn't worth it,\" the Connecticut Democrat said.\n\nHe also argued that implementing universal background checks was critical, citing statistics that gun murders in states with such checks have dropped by over one-third. Currently, background checks at gun shows and on internet sales aren't federally mandated. The NRA has opposed such an expansion.\n\nLater on, Trump again posited he would be willing to buck the NRA if necessary \u2014 despite the fact he's repeatedly assured the lobbying group he's a loyal ally, had lunch over the weekend with the group's leaders and said earlier in the meeting that he's a \"big fan\" of the group.\n\n\"They have great power over you people. They have less power over me,\" Trump said, latter adding that, \"Some of you people are petrified of the NRA. You can't be petrified.\"\n\n\"Take the gun first, go through due process second\"\n\nOne of the more surprising stances Trump took appeared to flaunt due process for gun owners \u2014 and one that is sure to enrage the NRA.\n\nAfter Vice President Pence began to talk about how he and the president had conversations with governors earlier this week, Trump interjected that people should \"take the firearms first and then go to court\" if there is a concern about someone having a gun and potentially being unstable or likely to commit violence.\n\n\"A lot of times by the time you go to court, it takes so long to go to court to get the due process procedures, I like taking the guns early,\" Trump continued.\n\nThe president cited multiple warnings that lawmakers had about the Parkland shooter that went ignored by law enforcement.\n\n\"Take the gun first, go through due process second,\" Trump said.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a frequent critic of the president, was not amused by such a suggestion.\n\n\"Strong leaders don't automatically agree with the last thing that was said to them. We have the Second Amendment and due process of law for a reason,\" Sasse said in a statement after the meeting. \"We're not ditching any Constitutional protections simply because the last person the President talked to today doesn't like them.\"\n\nAt last week's Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump warned the crowd that it was Democrats who would \"take away your Second Amendment...which we will never allow that.\"\n\nTrump did reiterate his support for one measure the NRA has heavily backed \u2014 arming some teachers and school personnel, ending gun-free school zones as a way to solidify school security.\n\n\"You've got to have defense too,\" the president said in his opening remarks. \"You can't just be sitting ducks, and that's exactly what we've allowed people in these buildings to be.\"\n\n\"They're not going to come in when they know they're going to come out dead,\" Trump later added, though he did seem to suggest it could be an issue left up to individual states.\n\nSome lawmakers, such as Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., Rep. John Rutherford, R-Fla., and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., who was critically shot last June during a congressional baseball practice, spoke out in support of such a proposal. Others, including Rep. Ted Deutsch, D-Fla., who represents Parkland, said he and many others oppose such measures.\n\nWill any of this matter?\n\nWhile the meeting did show that there could be some consensus reached on these issues, Trump has often thrown his support behind measures, only to see those endorsements walked back later by White House staff or contradicted by the president himself. That's on top of the fact that the president often appears highly influenced by the last person he talked to about an issue. So anything Trump appeared to get behind or suggest at the meeting should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nA similar bipartisan meeting in early January on efforts to field a comprehensive immigration bill which would address the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. In that meeting, Trump suggested he would sign any bill lawmakers sent him and that he would take any heat and expected backlash from the anti-immigration wing, which has been a major bloc of support for the president.\n\nBut later Trump insisted that any bill contain not only funding for his border wall but cuts to legal immigration, which was a non-starter with Democrats and even some Republicans. Ultimately, many proposals failed earlier this month in the Senate.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. \u2014 a sometimes critic, sometimes ally of Trump \u2014 expressed some skepticism after the meeting and also issued a warning.\n\n\"If the president has another one of these sessions and he doesn't follow through \u2014 it's going to hurt him. It's going to hurt the Republican Party,\" Graham told CNN. \"I've seen this movie before. If it ends up like immigration he's done himself a lot of harm.\"\n\nCornyn also said many of Trump's comments would not sway the debate. \"I wouldn't confuse what he said with what can actually pass. I don't expect to see any great divergence in terms of people's views on the Second Amendment, for example.\"\n\nCornyn is still supporting his incremental, bipartisan bill co-authored with Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., to improve the current background check system, but without broad agreement in the Senate, the legislation could easily get bogged down in more controversial gun debates. \"It's pretty clear to me that we're not going to get that consent agreement so that means [Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell] is going to have to make a decision on how to proceed and how much floor time he's willing to commit to this,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the week Cornyn has expressed hope that Congress could act on the bill this week, but he said today it is clear that will not happen. Like many lawmakers, he was candid that this gun debate may again yield no tangible legislative results. \"I think the deadline is going to be the next mass shooting. It's only a matter of time, and if we don't do something I think there's going to be a heavy price to pay,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"I don't want to meet another family who lost a loved one in a mass shooting and think we could have done something which would have prevented this, but we didn't do it because we didn't act.\"", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "", "body": "In Texas, Democratic Rep.

O'Rourke talks to Rachel Martin following Tuesday's primary in the Lone Star State.\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n    RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: \n\n    And I'm Rachel Martin at our member station KERA in Dallas, Texas, which has not elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1994. Democratic Congressman Beto O'Rourke of El Paso is hoping to change that, though. He won his party's primary for U.S. Senate yesterday. And he will now face incumbent Ted Cruz, who is already taking aim at O'Rourke. The Cruz campaign released a new statewide radio ad last night.\n\n    (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"IF YOU'RE GONNA RUN IN TEXAS\")\n\n    UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) Beto wants those open borders and wants to take our guns. Not a chance on earth he'll get a vote from millions of Texans. If you're going to run in Texas...\n\n    MARTIN: We are joined now by Congressman Beto O'Rourke. Thanks so much for being with us, Congressman.\n\n    BETO O'ROURKE: Good morning.\n\n    MARTIN: There's a smile in my voice because that song is a doozy. Do you plan to retaliate in kind with a similar jingle?\n\n    O'ROURKE: No. No. We're going to stay focused on the big things. You know, folks that I'm listening to across Texas, now having visited 226 counties, want to make sure that we're leading on the issues that they care most about. They want to make sure that everyone can afford to see a doctor or fill their prescriptions. We had a woman who died in Weatherford, Texas, last year of the flu - schoolteacher. Shouldn't be happening in 2018. They want this state, the defining immigrant state, to lead the way, not just in stopping a wall that we don't need but writing immigration laws in our own image that reflect our values and help us to make the most of everyone in our communities.\n\n    MARTIN: So let me ask you. You had, by far, the most name recognition in the Democratic primary yesterday. You only took home just over 60 percent of that vote. So if you can't get Democrats to unite behind you, how are you going to get the majority of Texans to do so?\n\n    O'ROURKE: You know, we've spent the last year making sure that we listen to and are with everyone that we want to represent and serve in Texas. So that means we're going to places like Archer City, that hasn't seen a U.S. Senate candidate in 70 years, since LBJ last campaigned there in 1948; means we're going to Lufkin; means we're going to Pecos County and Amarillo - not the usual places that you see a Democrat. But I want to represent and fight for all 28 million Texans. It doesn't matter to me whether they're Republicans or independents or nonvoters.\n\n    The idea is to be with them, listen to them and make sure that their issues and their fights are our issues and our fights. And so we've got another eight months in which to meet and listen to those that we want to serve and represent. It's a long, maybe frustrating strategy for some. But I think it's the right way to run a race in Texas and perhaps the only way to win.\n\n    MARTIN: Well, let me ask you on the issues. I've spoken to several voters here this week. One man, who says that he usually votes for Democrats - he told me he likes you, but if you support an assault weapons ban, that it would be a deal breaker for him. Do you think you can win in Texas by supporting a gun control measure like that?\n\n    O'ROURKE: I do. I think - when I listened to someone in Brownwood, a woman who says that she was born and raised on a ranch with a .22 in her hands, as she told me. But she also has 46 grandkids. And her No. 1 question to me was, can I trust you to stand up to the NRA? She can be forgiven for asking that because Ted Cruz has taken more than $300,000 from the NRA just in 2016 alone. So folks don't know whether he represents the NRA or Texans.\n\n    I haven't taken a dime from the NRA or any special interest group, corporation or PAC. I'm going to stand up for Texans. And Texans are asking me to make sure that we have universal background checks, that we don't sell weapons of war whose only purpose is to kill people as effectively and efficiently and in as great a number as possible. I want to make sure that their kids, their grandkids - that they are safe in their schools, in their churches, in their communities.\n\n    So I think that's the right thing to do. And I think Texas with a proud tradition of gun ownership and gun safety can lead the way on this issue.\n\n    MARTIN: But you just mentioned you've been crisscrossing the state on road trips, going to places that have never seen Democrats even be competitive. You still only got just 60 percent of the Democratic primary. Does that indicate the kind of support that will win statewide?\n\n    O'ROURKE: I think it indicates that we have a 24-month campaign strategy and a massive state, 254 counties - largest of the lower 48. So it's going to take a lot of time to listen...\n\n    MARTIN: Yeah.\n\n    O'ROURKE: ...To everyone and work with everyone. And I think you just need to watch us over the next eight months. And the...\n\n    MARTIN: We will...\n\n    O'ROURKE: ...Test will be on November 6.\n\n    MARTIN: Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke, thanks your time.\n\n    O'ROURKE: Thank you.\n\n\n    Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

He's also endorsing legislation to improve background checks, and urging states to pass laws temporarily keeping guns out of the hands of people judged to be dangerous to themselves or others.\n   A policy proposal unveiled Sunday evening has Trump renewing his support for arming teachers and other school employees on a volunteer basis. He stopped short of endorsing a higher age limit for would-be gun buyers.\n   Last week, Florida's legislature raised the age limit for buying long guns in that state from 18 to 21. The measure drew an immediate legal challenge from the National Rifle Association.\n   Nikolas Cruz, the gunman accused of killing 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, is 19 years old.\n   Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who will chair the new commission, praised students at the school for making safety a top priority for policymakers.\n   \"There's been a lot of talk in the past but very little action,\" DeVos said in a conference call with reporters. \"I have to give credit to the students in their courage and consistent call for action.\"\n   \n    \n\n    \n\n   The agenda outlined by the White House falls short of what many of the students have been calling for. And it leaves much of the heavy lifting to states. The president is not planning a speech or other public event to promote his plan.\n   Trump endorsed a bill sponsored by Sens. John Cornyn, R-Tex., and Chris Murphy, D-Conn., that's designed to improve the database used to check the backgrounds of would-be gun buyers. But he did not endorse a separate proposal from Sens. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Joe Manchin, D-WV, that would extend background checks to gun purchases made online and at gun shows.\n   The president will encourage states to authorize \"risk protection orders,\" which allow law enforcement to temporarily seize guns from people whom a court has determined to be dangerous. Such orders currently are allowed in only a handful of states. Florida joined their ranks last week.\n   Trump's agenda is generally consistent with policy positions of the NRA, which supports arming teachers and other school staffers, as well as improved background checks. Although the president initially supported a higher age limit for gun purchases, the White House left that out of its recommendation to states. The NRA opposes higher age limits. Administration officials say the president's commission will explore the idea.\n   On Saturday, Trump appeared to mock the idea of federal commissions \u2014 a trusty standby for politicians who want to give the appearance of action without the risk of actually doing anything.\n   \"We can't just keep setting up blue ribbon committees with your wife and your wife and your husband, and they meet and they have a meal and they talk,\" Trump told a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. \n   Although the school safety commission has no timetable to produce recommendations, DeVos insists it's not simply a stalling tactic.\n   \"There's no time to waste,\" DeVos said. \"No student, no family, no teacher, and no school should have to live the horror of Parkland, or Sandy Hook or Columbine again.\"", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jessica Taylor", "body": "Citing his ailing health, Sen.

One bars private employers from voluntarily cooperating with federal immigration officials and requires businesses to notify workers in advance of a federal raid.\n\nA second law restricts state and local law enforcement from voluntarily sharing information with the feds about the release dates of undocumented people in their custody. That law also bars the transfer of undocumented people into federal custody. The third law under federal challenge covers state inspections of detention facilities that hold noncitizens in federal custody.\n\nThe Justice Department is asking for a preliminary injunction to block those three laws.

In addition to ending new shipments to the island, the agency said it would turn the food and water that remained over to the Puerto Rican government, which would distribute them until stocks ran out.\n\nSpeaking on the Senate floor, Florida Democratic Sen.

Detroit Board of Education, and now a majority of justices seems poised to reverse it.\n\nIn 1977, the court said that while nobody is required to join a union, non-union employees can be required to pay partial dues, known as fair-share, or agency, fees. The idea is to prevent those who don't join the union from becoming \"free riders\" on the backs of union members. The caveat is that nonmembers do not have to pay for the union's lobbying and political activities.\n\nIn recent years, however, an energized, more conservative Supreme Court majority has aggressively viewed money as speech. Now it appears on the brink of a decision that would weaken public employee unions by barring these fair-share fee arrangements that currently exist in 22 states.\n\nThe case to be argued on Monday was brought by Mark Janus, a child support specialist for the state of Illinois. He is represented in court by the anti-union National Right to Work Committee, though he stresses that he is not against unions. As he puts it, \"The problem is that government has given these unions this special privilege to charge us for these fees, in essence, without my permission.\"\n\nIn his view, everything the union bargains for and that he benefits from, just means more taxes for the public.\n\nThis is the second time this issue has been argued in two years. The last time, the Obama administration joined with the teachers' union and the state of California in urging the justices to uphold the court's longstanding precedent. But the oral argument strongly suggested that the vote would be 5-to-4 to overturn the 1977 decision.\n\nWhen Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly, however, the court deadlocked 4-to-4 on the case, with all the Republican-appointed justices voting against mandatory fair-share, partial dues, and the Democratic appointees voting to uphold both the court's precedent and the partial dues.\n\nNow that the issue is back, the Trump administration has switched the government's position to oppose the unions and the many states that allow fair-share fees. And there is every reason to think that Trump appointee Justice Neil Gorsuch will side with the court's conservatives.\n\nTo get a feel for the court's thinking, take a glance back to the argument in 2016. The teachers' union, joined by the state of California, contended that fair-share arrangements prevent strikes and internal strife by providing a single elected union for the state, acting as employer, to deal with, as opposed to competing unions and groups of employees.\n\nIn many close controversies, Justice Anthony Kennedy is the justice most likely to be open to persuasion, but he is something of a purist on First Amendment free speech questions. Two years ago, he disputed the characterization of those who didn't want to pay partial union fees as \"free riders.\" Rather, he said, the union was making them into \"compelled riders.\"\n\nKennedy and other conservative justices on the court took the position that everything a public employee union bargains for involves public policy, and thus a public employee who disagrees with that policy should not be forced to pay for the negotiations.\n\nCalifornia's lawyer Edward DuMont argued that wages, hours and working conditions are not political. That prompted Chief Justice John Roberts to ask for a \"best example of something that is negotiated over in a collective bargaining agreement with a public employer that does not present a public policy question.\"\n\nDuMont replied, \"Mileage reimbursement rates or how you're going to have public safety.\"\n\n\"It's all money,\" shot back Roberts dismissively. \"If you give more mileage expenses [to teachers], the amount of money that's going to be allocated to public education as opposed to public housing, welfare benefits, that's always a public-policy issue.\"\n\nDuMont countered that nobody loses his or her right to speak when a democratically elected union represents the interests of all state employees and negotiates a contract with the state. Any employee with a disagreement is free to speak out publicly. Moreover, he said, when the state acts as an employer, and not as a sovereign, it should be able to do what private employers do \u2014maximize efficiency by negotiating with a single bargaining unit that represents the interests of all the employees.\n\nThat drew a caustic reply from Justice Kennedy who remarked, \"I suppose we could assume that a state is always benefited and is more efficient if it can suppress speech.\"\n\nMillions of employees might be affected\n\nThe court's liberals spoke repeatedly about the importance of consistency in the law. Justice Elena Kagan stressed that a 40-year-old court precedent should not be overruled without some compelling justification.\n\n\"This is a case in which there are tens of thousands of contracts with these provisions,\" she observed. \"Those contracts affect millions of employees, maybe as high as 10 million employees.\"\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer chimed in, \"You start overruling things, what happens to the country thinking of us as a kind of stability in a world that ... changes a lot.\"\n\nBut the conservative justices seemed unpersuaded, professing that overruling the 1977 decision shouldn't change things much. They said that if employees think they have benefited from union representation, they will still pay union dues or fair-share fees, even if the fee is not mandatory.\n\nDespite such assertions, the justices certainly know that unions are faltering in their influence. In the 1950s, about a third of the U.S. workforce was union members. Now, it's only about 11 percent overall.\n\nHowever, while the union membership rate in the private sector is a meager 6.5 percent, it's more than a third among public employees. The bottom line is because states generally require unions to bargain for and represent all workers, regardless of their membership in a union, this case is something of a dagger pointed at labor's heart.\n\nUnions fear that, if Mark Janus prevails, they would bleed operating funds to the point of ineffectiveness. There is some evidence to support that notion. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFSCME \u2014 which is the union involved in this case \u2014 conducted 600,000 one-on-one interviews with employees covered by AFSCME contracts and found that 35 percent would keep paying dues, 15 percent would not, and half were \"on the fence.\"\n\nIf those findings are accurate, a loss in the Supreme Court would mean unions would almost certainly face some unknown form of transformation or, potentially, extinction.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Asma Khalid", "body": "Report: Trump To Name CNBC Commentator Larry Kudlow As Top Economic Adviser\n\nLarry Kudlow, a conservative commentator and host on CNBC, is reportedly President Trump's new pick to replace former Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn as national economic council director, according to CNBC's reporting.\n\nKudlow would seem to be somewhat in line with his predecessor, who was a creature of Wall Street.

To that point, they'd surpassed GOP voter turnout and their own party's numbers during the same period in 2016, a presidential election year where voting numbers are typically much higher.\n\nThe rising Democratic enthusiasm mirrors what the party has already seen across the country in the nearly year and a half since President Trump was elected \u2014 more than three dozen state legislature seats changing hands, important wins in Virginia and New Jersey last year and mobilization through rallies and protests.\n\nTexas's primary brings the first actual voting in the 2018 midterm cycle, giving both parties a chance for a more concrete measure ahead of November's elections. Early signs of such a swell in a bulwark red state could be an even more ominous sign for Republicans nationally this fall if it's borne out by Tuesday's results.\n\n\"Texas is the nation's bellwether right now,\" said Tariq Thowfeek, the communications director for the Texas Democratic Party. \"It's a good gauge of the incredible progressive energy we have across the country in a state that is ranked at the bottom of the barrel in voter turnout.\"\n\nAfter the last day of early voting on Friday, the Cook Political Report's David Wasserman found that in the top 15 counties in the state, the Democratic early vote had spiked 105 percent over 2014 numbers. On the Republican side, there had been only a 15 percent uptick.\n\nA surge in Democrats on the ballot\n\nIt's not just an uptick in Democratic voters happening in Texas, but an increase in candidates putting their names on the ballot, too. Democrats are fielding a modern-day record number of candidates across the state. There are 111 U.S. House candidates running for the minority party, and they are spread across all 36 Texas congressional districts \u2014 the first time that's happened in 25 years, and a departure from two years ago when Democrats didn't run candidates in eight seats.\n\nOn a state legislative level, Democrats have candidates in 132 of the 189 state House districts and in 14 of the 15 state Senate districts up for election this year. That includes four Senate districts where Democrats didn't field candidates in 2014 or 2012, and 20 new House districts where they didn't have candidates in either 2016, 2014 or 2012.\n\nCal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University, said that the Democratic surge is even more impressive given that it's usually GOP voters, not Democrats, who have been reliable in non-presidential years.\n\n\"It's one word \u2014 enthusiasm. In a midterm election like this, what you normally expect to see is the Republicans' primary turnout might be twice what the Democratic turnout is, so to have the Democrats even with, and even slightly ahead, of Republicans in this midterm election is really extraordinary,\" Jillson said.\n\nKey suburban swing districts are likely to determine control of the House in 2018. There are several GOP-held districts like that which could be at play in Texas, such as Rep. Pete Sessions's suburban Dallas seat and Rep. John Culberson's suburban Houston district, which, along with Rep. Will Hurd's expansive border district that runs from San Antonio to El Paso, all voted for Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016.\n\n\"Going into this year, there was an expectation following the Women's March, in the wake of the elections in New Jersey and Virginia and all these special elections that something similar was likely to happen in the first-in-the-nation Texas primary, and I think it has,\" SMU's Jillson said. \"It signals a Democratic electorate that is motivated to make a statement against Donald Trump, and that motivation is nowhere more powerful than in female voters.\"\n\nThere's been a downside to the Democrats' surge of candidates in some places, however. In the primary to face Culberson, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee recently lobbed attacks against one candidate they didn't feel would be a strong challenger given past derisive comments about places in the state. That move prompted a backlash from some progressive groups and criticism from the head of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nMatt Angle, a longtime Texas Democratic strategist and director of the Lone Star Project, said the sheer number of candidates was still a positive thing for Democrats in a state where they've had trouble recruiting in the past, and noted that other primaries have been more civil. Those are encouraging signs, he said, for the way the state is trending politically.\n\n\"Make no mistake \u2014 it's a tough lift in Texas. It's a state still that is a right of center state, but I'm very encouraged,\" Angle said. \"The excitement being generated now among candidates will not only build, it will consolidate.\"\n\nPresident Trump under-performed past GOP presidential nominees in the state, carrying it in 2016 by only single digits, and a Gallup poll released at the end of January showed that the president's approval rating in Texas had dropped below 40 percent.\n\nWhile Trump's approval among Republican base voters remains strong, that dissatisfaction with the president is certainly driving Democratic turnout and convincing more disaffected voters to turn blue, Angle argued. For example, that has helped Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke in his upstart campaign to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. While O'Rourke still remains an underdog, he's been drawing large crowds and has even outraised Cruz recently with the help of small-dollar donors.\n\n\"In Texas, I think what you do have a chance to do is build a really strong coalition of Democrats, independents and fair-minded Republicans who are disillusioned with the type of leadership they're getting,\" Angle said.\n\nTexas GOP strategist Derek Ryan pointed out that Democrats do have some major statewide primaries, such as the gubernatorial race, that could be driving some turnout, but admitted that Democrats have done a good job of recruiting candidates across the board, thus making those competitive races more appealing to some voters.\n\nRyan also acknowledged that the rise in Democratic enthusiasm is worrisome for Republicans \u2014 especially because Democrats have gotten many low propensity voters to the polls. He's been diving into the early voting data, and his analysis found that many of those primary voters are ones that voted in 2016 \u2014 but haven't had a proclivity to vote yet in a midterm year when turnout typically drops off. And nearly a quarter of Democrats who cast early ballots were new voters who just registered in the past two years.\n\nOn the GOP side, Ryan found that first-time primary voters only made up about 10 percent of the early vote share, which is a dip from the 2014 midterm primaries. However, on the Democratic side, first time primary voters comprise over 22 percent of the early vote \u2014 way up from the 14 percent four years ago.\n\n\"While I don't think that Texas is going to turn blue this cycle, I do think with these turnout numbers, it could have a significant impact in some races, and some leaning Republican races in November,\" Ryan said.\n\nMatt Mackowiak, another Republican strategist in the state and chairman of the Travis County GOP, argued that the true test of Democratic enthusiasm will be on Tuesday night. He pointed out that early voting numbers also looked strong for Clinton back in 2016, but that was her high watermark and Election Day voting couldn't match Republican totals.\n\n\"For Republicans, if this is evidence of a significant enthusiasm gap, then that would be something to worry about,\" Mackowiak said. \"I'm not sure that it is yet, and just because you have stronger turnout in the primary doesn't mean it translates into Election Day vote in November.\"\n\nBut he admitted that the early numbers should give Republicans some pause and they certainly don't hold any good news if the trend continues on Tuesday.\n\n\"There's no way to look at this as positive for Republicans \u2014 it's either inconsequential, or it's bad,\" Mackowiak said.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Rachel Hubbard", "body": "Tax Cuts Put Oklahoma In A Bind. Now Gov. Fallin Wants To Raise Taxes\n\nRiding high on the oil boom of the late 2000s, the state followed the Kansas model and slashed taxes. But the promised prosperity never came. In many cases, it was just the opposite.\n\nAround 20 percent of Oklahoma's schools now hold classes just four days a week. Last year, highway patrol officers were given a mileage limit because the state couldn't afford to put gas in their tanks. Medicaid provider rates have been cut to the point that rural nursing homes and hospitals are closing, and the prisons are so full that the director of corrections says they're on the brink of a crisis.\n\nIn her State of the State address Monday, Gov.

We can do better! We deserve better! Our children deserve better, too!'\"\n\nMany of the tax cuts and subsequent revenue failures have happened on Fallin's watch. Now she wants to fix it and she's gotten behind a large coalition of business leaders who have come up with a plan to raise taxes and enact reforms.\n\n\"It's math,\" said banker David Rainbolt, a leader of the group known as Step Up Oklahoma. \"You can look at the problems we have and realize that there's not sustainable revenue going forward. This problem will occur over and over and over again in a commodity-based economy like ours unless we create revenue streams that create stability.\"\n\nBut there's a problem. When you pass a tax cut in the state of Oklahoma, it may as well be permanent. In the early 1990s, in reaction to a tax increase, voters passed a ballot measure requiring 75% of the legislature to vote in favor of any revenue hike.\n\nThis year, that supermajority requirement has given the tiny Democratic minority in Oklahoma the power to derail any plan. And even though the Step Up scheme meets many of their demands, House Minority Leader Steve Kouplen thinks it's just not enough.\n\n\"A drowning man will grab any lifeline, whether it's a good one or not,\" he said. \"One has been thrown to us. We think it needs to be tweaked, and we think some true compromise needs to take place to change it.\"\n\nDemocrats believe oil and gas companies have gotten rich while poor Oklahomans have borne the brunt of the cuts to state services. The Step Up plan, they say, doesn't do enough to protect the poor from paying to fix a mess they didn't make.\n\nRainbolt and the bipartisan business coalition that introduced the compromise plan say the state is in a mess and there's no easy way to fix it. They point to the fact that when they created the plan, business leaders from competing industries sat down at a table to find a solution and everyone had to give.\n\n\"We'd created something that no one in the room liked every part of but that everybody in the room agreed would move us forward.\" Rainbolt said. \"We thought it was salable to the legislature, and it appears that it is.\"\n\nBut the spirit of compromise hasn't reached lawmakers yet. They're now in their second special session trying to pass a budget for the current fiscal year.\n\nLobbying is fierce for the Step Up plan that is supposed to provide a more permanent revenue fix and leaders in the legislature say they're hoping to vote on it next week.

They can be used to support a narrative or retweet other messages in order to falsely amplify a message.\n\nThis project has identified and monitors 600 Twitter accounts linked to Russian influence operations and continuously update the results through an online 'dashboard.' The tracking effort is part of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative hosted by the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\nAfter more than half a year of tracking Russian influence on Twitter, the project's staff have noticed deeper trends that reveal how the Russian government tries to get its own message out to more Americans. In addition to fanning controversies, Hamilton 68 noticed that the bots are trying to expand American exposure to Russian foreign policy propaganda, in part by slipping it into innocuous conversations.\n\nThe bread and butter of Russia information operations remains an effort to divide Americans. Russian bots weren't commenting on the NFL, Charlottesville or DACA because they had a stake in the outcome of the political debate, according to those tracking the activity.\n\n\"These are not networks that are necessarily always traditional propaganda... a lot of it is just trying to rip apart Americans, to sow chaos within our political system, to pit Americans of both parties against each other,\" said Jamie Fly, a director for the Alliance for Securing Democracy and a former foreign policy aide for Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. \"And so a lot of the issues that we see these networks push are actually part of our day-to-day domestic political debates and often have nothing to do with foreign policy.\"\n\nThere has also been a massive increase in the amount of chatter that promotes mistrust of American institutions, especially the idea of an American \"deep state,\" the idea that there is a conspiracy of government officials working to undercut the president.\n\nThe deep state narrative was the focus of between five to ten percent of the weekly content on the Russia-linked influence network in October, when Hamilton 68 began its tracking. Last week, it represented 38 percent of the articles linked to by those accounts.\n\n\"That's gone from being a sort-of ripple beneath the surface, to now that's risen up to where it's typically the top thing we're seeing week-to-week,\" said Bret Schafer, the analyst for the project who updates the dashboard each day.\n\nLooking a little deeper, the Russian influence networks are using intriguing techniques to amplify their reach and change the types of content that Americans read.\n\n\"If you look at the dashboard day-to-day, it tends to follow the topic du jour that's in the general news cycle. So you'll see conversations about DACA or 'release the memo' or NFL protests, so you get caught at looking at the granular level and lose focus of the big-picture narratives,\" Schafer said. \"But when you zoom out and look at what's happened over the past six months, you start seeing some patterns start to emerge.\"\n\nOftentimes bots will begin tweeting about totally innocent topics, such as a sporting event or a trending Twitter topic, as a means for expanding their audience.\n\nSchafer said he noticed the trend when he saw a number of their monitored accounts start tweeting about #MondayMotivation and #WednesdayWisdom, popular hashtags used by many American Twitter users, mixed in with content about Syria and Ukraine that Russian bots frequently discuss, in defense of Russia's interventions in those countries.\n\n\"We look at that as being the recruitment topic,\" Schafer told NPR. \"If they started shouting about Syria and Ukraine... less people would see it, and it would be less effective.\"\n\nStill, the bots don't have a unified partisan slant, even though U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russian influence operations were aimed at supporting President Trump in the 2016 campaign.\n\n\"The reality is that they also turn against Republicans,\" Fly said. \"They have gone after administration officials like [National Security Advisor H.R.] McMaster. They've attacked [House] Speaker [Paul] Ryan, [Senate Majority] Leader [Mitch] McConnell. They've attacked Republican senators Marco Rubio, [Jeff] Flake, Sen. [John] McCain on a regular basis. No one in American politics is immune from the reach of these networks.\"\n\nAnd so this is why Fly has teamed up with Laura Rosenberger, who was Hillary Clinton's foreign policy adviser during the 2016 presidential campaign. Together, they're co-directors for the Alliance for Securing Democracy's efforts to track and push back against Russian meddling in the American political system.\n\n\"The bipartisan aspect of what we're doing is actually strategically important,\" Rosenberger said, pointing to the apparent Russian goal of increasing political division.\n\nEven on Capitol Hill, where bipartisanship is the exception rather than the rule, there's a bipartisan understanding that Russia meddled in the American political process during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nRosenberger pointed to the \"nearly unanimous\" vote in Congress to impose sanctions on Russia as evidence, although the White House recently said it will not implement Russia-related sanctions that Congress required because it was not necessary at this point.\n\nStill, those on both sides of the aisle understand that there has been no letup.\n\n\"The Russian effort to undermine our democracy did not end with Election Day in 2016 \u2014 these tools, whether creation of fake accounts, or the use of automated bots, continues on an ongoing basis,\" said Virginia Sen.

Corn was the first to reveal the existence of the infamous Russia dossier, the unverified collection of reports alleging connections between the Trump campaign and Russia compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele.\n\nNow, in their new book, Russian Roulette, the two men attempt to put all the pieces of the story together.\n\n\"We start the book with Donald Trump's trip to Moscow in 2013, when he really first forms this 'bromance' with Vladimir Putin,\" Isikoff says.\n\nIsikoff notes that Trump's 2013 trip to Russia for the Miss Universe pageant centered on a business deal: \"He signed a letter of intent to build a Trump Tower in Moscow with a Putin-connected oligarch, Aras Agalarov.\"\n\nIn 2016, Agalarov would later be one of the conduits for what was described to Donald Trump Jr. as an offer of help to the Trump campaign by the Russian government.\n\nThe earlier potential deal for the Moscow Trump Tower fell through, Isikoff says, after the Obama administration and the European Union imposed sanctions on Russia following the annexation of Crimea and the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut Corn says that the stalled deal may help explain other elements of the story: \"People have been trying to figure out for years the positive remarks that Donald Trump has made about Vladimir Putin ... It's almost hiding in plain sight that one reason he has for saying all these kind things about Putin is that he was always interested in doing business deals there.\"\n\nOn Trump's interest in meeting Vladimir Putin during his 2013 trip to Moscow\n\nMichael Isikoff: This is when he's presiding over the Miss Universe pageant. He goes to great lengths to try to get a meeting with Putin. It doesn't come through for a variety of interesting reasons, but he then wants to tell the world that he met with Putin anyway, and he actually repeatedly does, even though he didn't.\n\nBut you can see the seeds of the Trump-Putin relationship in that trip. And what was it all about? It was all about a business deal. He signed a letter of intent to build a Trump Tower in Moscow with a Putin-connected oligarch, Aras Agalarov, and it was something that was a very high priority for him and had been for many years.\n\nOn how the project to build a Trump Tower in Moscow influenced Trump's views on Russia\n\nIsikoff: In February 2014, Ivanka Trump travels to Moscow to scout potential sites for the Trump Tower with Emin Agalarov and the project doesn't ultimately go through. Why? ... One development that may well have played a big factor ... was ... this is right at the time Putin has annexed Crimea, invaded Ukraine, stiff sanctions are put on by the Obama administration and the European Union, including Sberbank, the bank that was going to finance the [Trump Tower] operation.\n\nAnd Rob Goldstone, who is quoted in the book \u2014 and this is, I believe, the first interview he's given to anybody about these developments \u2014 says he believes that it was the imposition of sanctions that killed the deal and that this may well have influenced Trump's view of sanctions and his advocacy later on, during the presidential campaign, of lifting sanctions on Russia.\n\nDavid Corn: Sberbank is majority-owned by the Russian state, by the Russian government. Which means that Trump was trying to enter into a deal that involved the Russian government. And, of course, no major projects can take place in Moscow \u2014 and this is a deal worth billions of dollars \u2014 without the approval of the government. And who runs the government? Vladimir Putin.\n\nOn the Trump administration's denial of Russian interference in the election\n\nDavid Corn: [Trump's circle] had reason to believe more than anybody else that there was a Russian effort to help and to boost Trump. They knew that members of their own campaign \u2014 people like George Papadopoulos and Carter Page \u2014 were making connections with Russian officials and Russian cutouts. And Trump was even briefed in Mid-August 2016 when he was a candidate about the Russian hacking of the election and still after that continued to say it wasn't happening ... Again and again and again, Trump and his defenders say that there was no contact with Russia, \"We did nothing wrong.\"\n\nPut that all together with a little bit of distance and you see how the Trump campaign and Trump himself almost in a way aided and abetted what the Russians were doing by continually denying that they had any role in the election and making it difficult for the United States and the Obama administration to forge a bipartisan response to what was happening.\n\nCorn: His name was Gen. [Valery] Gerasimov, and this came out in an obscure military journal in early 2013 and no one paid much attention to it until a translation appeared a few months later. He basically said, listen, the war of the future will not be played out in real space. It won't be between battalions and fleet of aircraft and fighter jets, it's going to come about through other means.\n\nIt was pretty stunning to see it in retrospect \u2014 [he] talked about how to take advantage of the divisions within your enemy. If you look at what happened in 2016 with the social media campaign and with the hacks and dumps that the Russians pulled off, what they did was exploit existing sometimes very bitter divisions within America.\n\nThey did it on Facebook, they did it on Twitter, they figured out how to turn Bernie Sanders supporters against Hillary Clinton, they really took advantage of some of the political conflict and strife that we're ultimately responsible for in the United States, but that was one of the things that the general pointed to that could be weaponized, and they did so quite well, I think, in 2016.\n\nSam Briger and Thea Chaloner produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

None of the other six pre-approved candidates rose above the single digits.\n\nOpposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was barred from running after organizing nationwide anti-government protests, had called for a boycott of the election and vigorous vote monitoring to uncover any irregularities. But in a country dominated by state media that have helped generate a loyal following, the Putin juggernaut plowed over any obstacles, including accusations of ballot stuffing and other violations.\n\n\"Putin is great. We trust and love him. There aren't any other candidates as of yet,\" said Roza Yarulina, 64, a retired economics teacher who was voting at a polling station in a vocational school in Yekaterinburg, 900 miles east of Moscow, on the geographical border between Europe and Asia.\n\nAs a former Communist Party member, Yarulina said she cast her ballot for Grudinin because she was sure Putin would win and wanted to support her second choice.\n\nTatyana Ovchinikova, 65, a retired college instructor dressed in a fur coat, said she respected the incumbent but was voting for Grigory Yavlinsky, a liberal economist who ended up with 1 percent of the vote.\n\n\"I've had a dream since I was a kid to put a check mark next to a candidate's name, but it hasn't come true,\" said first-time voter Grigory Dementyanov, who intentionally spoiled his ballot so someone else couldn't fill it out. The 21-year-old music student said he opposed all the candidates, and that he didn't think Navalny would have been up to the task of leading Russia.\n\nLike other large Russian cities, Yekaterinburg, with a population of 1.4 million, is more supportive of opposition candidates. But in multiple interviews across the country, voters voiced a combination of anxiety and frustration over the lack alternatives to Putin.\n\nAfter garnering a record election win with more than 55 million votes in his fourth presidential run, Putin, 65, now has a strong mandate to rule Russia for another six years.\n\nFor many Russians, the predictability of Putin's reign is preferable to new political upheavals.\n\n\"We Russians just don't want things to get any worse. You Americans always expect things to get better,\" said Anton Volkhin, 36, a distributor in Yekaterinburg for a national sausage company and the father of two. \"Too many people have too much to lose. Those who don't are still in the minority.\"\n\nIn a country that has experienced a revolution, civil war, slave labor camps, a Nazi invasion and the collapse of an empire all within the past century, many Russians express relief that at least war hasn't reached their territory. Putin's military intervention in Ukraine is widely seen by Russians as a defensive move against encroachment by the United States, while Russia's 2 \u00bd-year participation in Syria's civil war barely registers with ordinary people.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm afraid, very afraid, that war will break out,\" said Yelena Okhotenko, 36, who serves in the Russian military. \"There's constantly this aggression toward us, and we're constantly holding back. I don't know how long our country can hold out.\"\n\nThe mother of two children, Okhotenko said she has been supporting Putin since she first could vote, in 2000. \"This president did very much for Russia and my town and personally for me and my family,\" she said, standing on the refurbished embankment in the city Nizhny Tagil. \"He raised up our country, and he raised our quality of life.\"\n\nNiznhy Tagil, a two-hour drive north of Yekaterinburg, has been nicknamed \"Putingrad\" for the president's visits to the city's giant tank factory.\n\n\"You can't talk about Putin's level of support, but the level of fear,\" said Pavel Sergienya, 35, the founder of an independent trade union. \"People are afraid to openly express their opinion except in their kitchens, just like in the Soviet Union.\"\n\nAndrei Antropov is an exception. The 36-year-old volunteer for opposition leader Navalny was called in by the police three days before the election for a \"conversation\" with criminal investigators.\n\n\"I can't rule out that there will be consequences for me at work, but I'm going to continue my activism,\" said Antropov, a manager for a telecommunications company.\n\nNavalny, who spent a year building a nationwide network of campaign offices and volunteers before his candidacy was denied, focused on domestic issues such as economic stagnation and government corruption.\n\nPutin, on the other hand, highlighted Russia's return to the world stage as an independent actor that could stand up to U.S. hegemony.\n\n\"Strange as it may seem, in Russia economic problems don't convert well into political decisions,\" said Dmitry Kolezev, 33, the deputy editor of Yekaterinburg's independent news site znak.com. \"People will tighten their belts, but they won't hold the Russian government responsible for their problems as much as, say, the United States, which imposed sanctions on Russia.\"\n\nThe U.S. and European Union hit Russia with economic sanctions for annexing Crimea and backing an armed uprising in Ukraine's Donbas region in 2014. That year marked the start of a downward spiral in relations between Russia and the West.\n\nIn the week before the presidential election, those tensions increased. Britain expelled 23 Russian diplomats after accusing Moscow of being behind the poisoning of a former Russian spy on British soil. The Trump administration imposed sanctions on Russians suspected of being behind election interference and cyberattacks. Far from hurting Putin, the news added to the Kremlin's narrative that Western countries are unfairly targeting Russia for unproven transgressions.\n\nIn the runup to the vote, Putin played up his decisiveness in seizing the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine, and the election date was scheduled to coincide with the fourth anniversary of the annexation. Given that many Russians vacation in Crimea or have family there, the association was supposed to evoke a sense of pride and defiance.\n\n\"I'm voting for Putin for the first time in my life. Russia is the kind of country that always rallies around its leader in tough times,\" said Dmitry Ardanov, 41, an office security guard in Vladivostok on Russia's Pacific coast. \"Putin did one important thing, and after that I understood he's a real man: He took back Crimea and supported Donbas.\"\n\nA recent poll by the independent Levada Center shows 86 percent of Russians support the annexation of Crimea, and opposition figures such as Navalny turned off voters by questioning the legitimacy of the controversial separatist referendum, which was held after Russian troops had occupied the peninsula.\n\nWhat unites Putin's most ardent supporters and vociferous foes is uncertainty over what comes next.\n\n\"We're in a situation where there aren't any worthy alternatives, so all that's left is the hope that Putin can accomplish something in domestic politics,\" said Rim Averyanov, 27. He quit his job as a school teacher in the provincial town of Vladimir because of his low salary and is going into the private sector in Moscow.\n\nAveryanov, who opposes Putin, said he's afraid a new revolution could break out if the Kremlin fails to address pressing economic issues that are impoverishing the population. But like many government critics, Averyanov said he doesn't view Navalny as a leader tough enough to take on Russia's myriad problems.\n\nEven before preliminary election results were in Sunday evening, Navalny appeared on his YouTube channel debating Ksenia Sobchak, a pro-Western candidate who picked up less than 2 percent of the vote. Navalny rejected her offer to join forces, calling her a Kremlin tool and a \"champion of hypocrisy\" for participating in the elections.\n\nSquabbles inside Russia's fractured opposition hardly raise their profile as a viable alternative to Putin.\n\nSofia Kastilo, a 28-year-old English teacher in Tula, 100 miles south of Moscow, called Navalny and Sobchak \"clowns.\" Kastilo said she didn't believe that Navalny, who has built his popularity as an anti-corruption campaigner, could uproot graft.\n\n\"Speaking about corruption: well it existed, it exists, and it will exist,\" Kastilo said. \"If Navalny becomes president, where is the guarantee that there won't be any corruption? There is no guarantee.\"\n\nLike many Russians, Kastilo voiced concern about who will come after Putin when his fourth term comes to an end in 2024.\n\nAccording to Russia's constitution, no president can serve more than two consecutive terms.\n\nAsked after his victory if he wants to change the law, Putin said he had no such plans \u2014 yet.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Megan Pauly", "body": "Virginia Gov.

But this year, the state legislature is going into a special session to continue discussions about whether or not to include it in its budget. By the time the regular session adjourned Saturday, members of Virginia's GOP-controlled House of Delegates and Senate could not reach agreement on whether or not to expand Medicaid.\n   Republican Delegate Barry Knight from the Virginia Beach area calls it \"the 800-pound gorilla in the room.\" He's one of more than a dozen Republicans who voted to include Medicaid expansion in the House budget \u2014 along with a work requirement \u2014 this year.\n   It's a big shift in the House position on the issue and comes after 15 seats flipped in the so-called \"blue wave\" of last November's election, which also saw the election of Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam.\n   \"On the big-picture issues, I think it was a re-awakening and a call to look at things from a different perspective,\" says Republican Delegate Chris Peace, from the Richmond area.\n   \n    \n\n    \n\n   At a recent rally outside the state Capitol in Richmond, Northam continued his campaign message. \"Are you all ready to get this done?\" he called to the crowd's cheers. \"Are you ready to expand coverage?\"\n   A December poll showed over 80 percent of likely Virginia voters support an expansion.\n   \"I think the House heard that message, loud and clear. I think the Senate still needs to listen a little bit,\" Northam says.\n   He's referring to a strong movement against expansion, led by Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment from the Tidewater area in southeastern Virginia. Norment has come out against the House Republicans who want to expand. He reminds them that despite a slim margin, Republicans are still in charge and could stop Medicaid expansion.\n   \"I do think that the House of Delegates is waiting for that moment of lucidity and epiphany to realize that their majority is 51 to 49,\" Norment says.\n   But President Trump has managed to mobilize Democratic voters, says Bob Holsworth, a former political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. He thinks expansion has a greater chance this year.\n   It could pass in the Senate, he says, because of a potential wildcard.\n   That wildcard is Republican Sen. Emmett Hanger, from mostly-rural central Virginia. Hanger has expressed support for some form of Medicaid expansion, and has a track record of voting independently, says Holsworth.\n   \"What Hanger has said that's very interesting ... is that if he decides to support some version of Medicaid expansion, he says, 'There are a number of other Republicans who are going to go over with me.' \"\n   However, Hanger isn't happy about a tax on hospitals that has been incorporated into the House's budget to help pay for the state's share of expansion costs. The tax accounts for about three quarters of the over $400 million Medicaid-related gulf between House and Senate budgets.\n   If legislators don't come up with a budget that includes Medicaid expansion, Northam has a plan B. He says he'll introduce an amendment to add it back into the budget. In the amendment process, the lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, gets a vote if the Senate ties. Fairfax says he'd be happy to vote to expand coverage to up to 400,000 low-income Virginians.\n   \"There are so many people that we can help and we have the means to do it if we expand Medicaid. We just have to have the political will to do it,\" Fairfax says.\n   Among those expansion would help in Virginia: low-income adults without children.\n   \"An adult who does not have children can have zero income \u2014 can be totally impoverished \u2014 and they cannot get Medicaid,\" says Jill Hanken with the Virginia Poverty Law Center.\n   And a family of three with a total income of about $10,000 doesn't qualify for Medicaid, she says.\n   \"It's hard to explain to them that they don't have a choice, they're not eligible for Medicaid,\" she says, and they're not eligible for subsidies for insurance on the exchange, so health insurance is out of reach. \"And the reason is because Virginia hasn't expanded Medicaid,\" she says.\n   The special session begins April 11.

Sessions has intervened in two cases that could have big implications for people who come to the U.S. and seek asylum.  \n   This comes as the number of applications for asylum has risen sharply in recent years. Sessions has been trying to eliminate what he's called \"rampant fraud and abuse\" in those applications, and to cut into a massive backlog of immigration cases.  \n   But immigrant rights advocates fear that legitimate asylum-seekers, including victims of domestic violence, could be denied sanctuary here.  \n   \"They are amongst the most vulnerable people in our society,\" said Jeremy McKinney, an immigration lawyer in North Carolina, and secretary of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \"To have their rights curtailed so that the system moves faster I think should be considered a moral outrage,\" he said.  \n   \n    \n\n    \n\n   \n            \n\n    \n        \n            \n                Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been trying to eliminate what he's called \"rampant fraud and abuse\" in asylum applications to cut into a massive backlog of immigration cases. \"The system is being gamed, there's no doubt about it,\" Sessions said last year.\n                \n                \n                    \n                    Susan Walsh/AP\n                    \n                \n                hide caption\n            \n\n        \n\n\n\n            toggle caption\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n        Susan Walsh/AP\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been trying to eliminate what he's called \"rampant fraud and abuse\" in asylum applications to cut into a massive backlog of immigration cases. \"The system is being gamed, there's no doubt about it,\" Sessions said last year.\n\n        \n            \n            Susan Walsh/AP\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n   \n\n   To Attorney General Sessions, the outrage is that immigrants are gumming up the courts with false claims.  \n   \"The system is being gamed, there's no doubt about it,\" Sessions said in October of last year, in a speech to the Executive Office for Immigration Review in Virginia. Back then, he was asking Congress to tighten asylum rules. Last week, he acted on this own.  \n   In one case, the attorney general vacated a precedent-setting ruling that said most asylum seekers have a right to a hearing in front of a judge before their claim could be rejected. In a second case, Sessions is reviewing whether victims of \"private crime\" should qualify for asylum.  \n   These moves come as no surprise to anyone who's followed Sessions's positions on immigration and asylum. \n   \"We can close loopholes and clarify our asylum laws to ensure that they help those they were intended to help,\" Sessions said in his October speech. \"As this system becomes overloaded with fake claims, it cannot deal effectively with just claims.\"  \n   Immigration courts do face a huge backlog \u00e2\u20ac\u201d upwards of 600,000 cases, more than triple the number in 2009.  \n   One factor driving that growing backlog is constant stream of women and children from Central America. Many of these migrants claim they're eligible for asylum because they've been the victims of gangs, or domestic violence, in their home countries.  \n   But some, like former immigration judge Andrew Arthur, are skeptical about this kind of claim.  \n   \"It's actually become sort of a catchall for truly inventive lawyers,\" said Arthur, who is now a fellow at the Center for Immigration studies, which advocates for lower levels of immigration.  \n   Immigration courts work differently than regular courts. They're part of the Justice Department, so the attorney general has the power to personally overturn decisions by immigration courts. \n   Arthur, the former immigration judge, applauds the recent moves by Sessions. \"One, it is going to streamline the system,\" Arthur said. \"Two, it's going to cut down on the number of claims that are inevitably going to be found to be invalid.\"  \n   Immigration lawyers don't dispute that the number of asylum applications has spiked.

And on Utah's Capitol Hill, people treat one another with respect.\"\n\nRomney possibly joining the Senate adds yet another layer of drama to Washington. During the 2016 campaign, Romney called Trump a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\" Trump, who unsuccessfully tried to persuadee Hatch to run for reelection, responded hotly during the campaign, saying Romney \"would have dropped to his knees\" for Trump's endorsement in 2012.\n\nFrom afar, Romney has been critical of Trump's policies. Now, he has the opportunity to do it up close \u2014 and with a likely national television spotlight, if he seeks it out, that will beam him right into the White House, in plain view of this president, a habitual cable-news watcher.\n\nRomney's announcement was widely anticipated after Hatch, the longest-serving Republican senator in U.S. history, said in early January that he was calling it quits after 42 years of service. Hatch told The Salt Lake Tribune that he was urging Romney to run.\n\nRomney is seen as an early favorite to win the Senate seat, but not every Republican in the state is happy he's running. He's facing criticism, for example from, of all people, the state Republican Party chairman.\n\n\"I think he's keeping out candidates that I think would be a better fit for Utah,\" Rob Anderson told the Tribune, \"because, let's face it, Mitt Romney doesn't live here, his kids weren't born here, he doesn't shop here.\"\n\nRomney was governor of Massachusetts, where he was a registered voter and ran his private investment firm, Bain Capital. He also has lived most of the time at his beachside home in San Diego.\n\nBut Romney also owns a home in Park City, Utah, and has close ties to the leadership of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In addition to serving as a missionary for the church in France in the 1960s, he has held several leadership positions, including lay bishop. He is probably the most prominent Mormon in the country.\n\nPerhaps to combat the carpetbagger critique \u2014 and to assure voters of his focus in running for the Senate \u2014 he mentions Utah by name 14 times in his announcement video. Another potential critique is that the 70-year-old might use his potential national platform to run for president again in two or six years.\n\nBolstering his case to run, Romney has consistently been regarded as one of the most popular politicians in the state. A poll from November, for example, showed him with a 69 percent approval rating. Early Senate race polling has shown Romney comfortably ahead in hypothetical matchups against Democrat Jenny Wilson, who currently sits on the Salt Lake County Council.\n\nHow he got here\n\nRomney ran for the Senate in Massachusetts in 1994, losing to Democrat Ted Kennedy. He was elected as the state's governor in 2002.\n\nIn the interim, Romney stepped in to turn around the scandal-plagued 2002 Salt Lake Winter Olympics, which vaulted his reputation in Utah.\n\nHis connection to his church has also been key. In fact, that connection goes back generations. Romney's great-great-grandfather Miles Romney was a Mormon pioneer, who settled in Utah in the 19th century and designed the famed St. George Tabernacle.\n\nIn 2012, Romney won nearly 73 percent share of the vote in Utah, soundly defeating President Barack Obama there by 48 points. Contrast that with the 2016 presidential race. While Donald Trump won Utah, he only received 46 percent of the vote.\n\nMany Utahans, fueled by their growing unease with Trump's divisive rhetoric, instead cast their vote for Evan McMullin, a third-party candidate and a Mormon, who got 21 percent.\n\nRomney's stature in the GOP and history of criticizing Trump create the potential for a powerful Trump Republican critic coming to Washington as others like Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona retire.\n\nHere's how NPR's Mara Liasson envisioned the scenario playing out in a report from December:\n\nAfter clashes between white nationalists and counterprotesters turned deadly in August in Charlottesville, Va., Romney was critical of the president's early response in which Trump said there was \"blame on both sides.\" Romney condemned Trump's response in a Facebook post, saying Trump's comments \"caused racists to rejoice.\"\n\nHe also criticized Trump's reported vulgar comments about African nations and Haiti last month.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Romney excoriated Trump by delivering a speech at the University of Utah. \"Here's what I know. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud,\" Romney said, later adding, \"He has neither the temperament nor the judgment to be president. And his personal qualities would mean that America would cease to be a shining city on a hill.\"\n\nTrump returned fire, accusing Romney of being willing to do anything for his endorsement in 2012.\n\n\"He was begging for my endorsement,\" Trump said. \"I could have said, 'Mitt, drop to your knees,' he would have dropped to his knees.\"\n\nStill, after the campaign, Romney was floated as a possible secretary of state candidate for Trump. The two met during Trump's transition into the White House to discuss the role. No offer materialized, but Romney was photographed looking on awkwardly.\n\nWhen Hatch announced his retirement, amid much speculation about Romney's run, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked whether Trump would commit to campaigning for the eventual GOP nominee.\n\n\"I don't think we've made a determination in terms of campaigning, but the president certainly has the greatest and deepest amount of respect for Sen. Hatch and his over four decades of experience in the Senate,\" Sanders said at the time.\n\nMonths prior to Hatch's announcement, Trump publicly and privately tried to persuade the 83-year-old senator to seek re-election this year.\n\nThe president showered Hatch with praise at a Salt Lake City event in December. \"You are a true fighter, Orrin,\" Trump said. Another time, the president said he hopes Hatch stays in the Senate \"for a long time to come.\"\n\nWith his Senate run, Romney has an opportunity to change perceptions that dogged him throughout his presidential campaign \u2014 that he is an out-of-touch plutocrat, detached from the realities lived by many Americans.\n\nMuch of Romney's considerable personal wealth, at the time estimated to be about $250 million, was attained as a venture capitalist in the 1980s as the head of the firm Bain Capital.\n\nRomney tried to counter that image by picking a wonky, more energetic and self-proclaimed \"young gun\" running mate in Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who was at the time the chairman of the House Budget Committee. As NPR reported at the time, the pick energized some in the GOP base but ultimately did not win him the White House. Ryan is now speaker of the House, and the two remain in contact.\n\nTwo issues that Romney contended with in 2012, and that still haunt the GOP today, are health care and Russia.\n\nLike many Republicans, Romney vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature achievement, even though he started a similar program as governor of Massachusetts.\n\nAnd at the time, Romney was mocked for saying Russia was the country's top \"geopolitical foe.\"\n\n\"[Russia] is, without question, our No. 1 geopolitical foe,\" he told CNN in 2012. \"They fight every cause for the world's worst actors. The idea that he has some more flexibility in mind for Russia is very, very troubling, indeed.\"\n\nRomney appeared to be offering a prescient warning after the Russian efforts to influence the 2016 campaign came to light.

Ultimately, he did not get a meeting, but he met with Donald Trump Jr. at the NRA's 2016 convention.The National Rifle Association spent some $30 million to support Trump in the 2016 presidential race, close to triple what they spent supporting Mitt Romney in 2012. However, no public evidence has emerged showing that the NRA took any money from Russians.\n\n\"The National Rifle Association has not been contacted by the FBI or any other investigative body,\" spokesman Andrew Arulanandam told NPR.\n\nThe NRA's links to Russia were highlighted behind closed doors by Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, the founder of the firm that commissioned a dossier on Trump's ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign. In private testimony before the House Intelligence Committee in November, Simpson alleged closed ties between the Russian government and the NRA.\n\n\"It appears the Russians, you know, infiltrated the NRA,\" Simpson told the panel, in a since-released transcript. \"It appears that the Russian operation was designed to infiltrate conservative organizations.

Now they won't answer any questions about it,\" said John Feinblatt, the president of the group. \"It makes you wonder how much the gun lobby really spent on Trump in 2016 and where that money might've come from.\"\n\nAnd liberal media watchdog Media Matters blared in a headline: \"NRA's denial it has illegal ties to Russia hits stumbling block with revelation of FBI investigation.\"\n\nBut despite the links that exist between Torshin and the National Rifle Association, even some liberals note that the scenario seems so fantastical that it is hard to imagine that it is real.\n\n\"A scenario in which the Russian investigation ensnares the N.R.A., probably the most influential conservative group in the United States, seems a bit too much like Resistance fan fiction, too delicious to be true,\" columnist Michelle Goldberg wrote in the New York Times.\n\nThe ALDF's complaint helps draw attention to the issue, but faces long odds on whether the FEC will actually take action.

The federal government has spent much less on research into gun violence than on similarly lethal issues, such as motor vehicle crashes, liver disease and sepsis.\n\n\"Most of the effects that we were looking for evidence on, we didn't find any evidence,\" says Andrew Morral, a behavioral scientist at RAND and the leader of the project.\n\nThey found, for example, no clear evidence regarding the effects of any gun policies on hunting and recreational gun use, or on officer-involved shootings, or on mass shootings or on the defensive use of guns by civilians.\n\nThere were some categories with better data, however, Morral says. There is relatively strong evidence, for example, that policies meant to prevent children from getting access to firearms \u2014 such as laws that require guns to be stored unloaded, or in locked containers \u2014 reduce both suicide and unintentional injury and death.\n\nPrevious work has also found that places that require a permit (issued by law enforcement) for the purchase a firearm do reduce violent crime.\n\nThere is also some evidence that prohibitions against purchase by people who have been diagnosed with mental illness reduce violent crime, and that \"stand your ground\" laws, which allow citizens who feel threatened in public to use lethal force without retreating first, lead to an increase in violent crime.\n\nIn general, however, good studies were few and far between, the RAND researchers say.\n\nTo help bridge the data gap for scientists, RAND has now compiled an open-source database of state-by-state gun laws going back to 1979. A similar, unrelated database run out of Boston University was published last year.\n\n\"Given the lack of data in the firearm research field, [the RAND database] will be a welcome addition, and I'm sure it will be valuable to researchers,\" says Dr. Michael Siegel, the physician who leads the Boston University project. He notes that, since it launched, the Boston database has been most helpful for journalists writing about gun violence.\n\n\"It's funny because I didn't actually think about that as a purpose of the project when we started it,\" says Siegel \"but it seems to have become the primary use of the database so far (in addition to use by other researchers).\"\n\nThe RAND team also surveyed 95 gun policy experts from across the political spectrum about what they thought the effects of 15 different gun policies would be on 12 outcomes. The policies included universal background checks, bans on the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, expanded mental illness prohibitions, minimum age requirements and required reporting of lost or stolen weapons.\n\nMany of the policies are now being considered by state and federal lawmakers, after a man used an AR-15-style rifle to kill 17 people at a Florida high school in February.\n\nThe vast majority of the specialists Rand surveyed agreed that the primary objectives of gun policies should be reducing suicides and homicides, and that protecting privacy, enabling hunting and sport shooting and preventing mass shooting were secondary priorities.\n\n\"That was a surprise, actually,\" says Morral. \"I think people on either side of gun policy debates think that the other side has misplaced values \u2014 or that it's a values problem, in any case. But that's not what we find. We find people prioritize the same things in the same order.\"\n\nHowever, those surveyed varied widely in their predictions about how different policies would affect each outcome.\n\n\"Where they disagree is on which laws will achieve those those objectives. So this is a disagreement about facts,\" says Morral. \"And the facts are sparse.\"", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Tom Dreisbach", "body": "Former Trump Campaign Adviser Was More Than A Coffee Boy, Fiancee Says\n\nEver since Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller unveiled charges against George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump 2016 presidential campaign, the White House has insisted Papadopoulos played an unimportant role in the campaign.\n\nAccording to court papers, Papadopoulos was told in April 2016 that Russia had \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton in the form of \"thousands of emails.\" As the world found out later, that information was true. The meeting took place shortly after John Podesta's Gmail account was breached, in addition to the earlier hack of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nIt remains unclear what, if anything, Papadopoulos told the campaign about that conversation. A key question in the Mueller investigation is what Papadopoulos told the campaign, and what, if anything, the campaign did with that information.\n\nBut after the charges became public, the White House immediately distanced itself from Papadopoulos.\n\n\"He was somebody that played a minimal role, if one at all,\" said press secretary Sarah Sanders last fall.\n\n\"I never heard of Papadopoulos,\" former Trump adviser Michael Caputo told CNN. \"He was the coffee boy.\"\n\nMore recently, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the chairman of the House intelligence committee and an ally of the Trump White House, told Fox News that Papadopoulos \"never even had met with the president.\"\n\nThis is false. Then-candidate Trump tweeted a photo of a foreign policy meeting with several advisers, including Papadopoulos. Nunes' recently released memo also makes clear that the FBI began its investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential race and possible connections between Russia and the Trump campaign because of Papadopoulos.\n\nPapadopoulos himself has not spoken publicly since he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, leaving the administration's narrative more or less unchallenged.\n\nBut his fiancee, Simona Mangiante, has decided to defend Papadopoulos whenever journalists will listen, and is telling a much different story than the one coming from the White House.\n\n\"I felt this frustration for him,\" Mangiante tells NPR's Embedded. \"And that's why I accepted to speak.\"\n\nMangiante is from Italy, and she first met Papadopoulos after the presidential campaign, when Papadopoulos sent her a message on LinkedIn. Mangiante and Papadopoulos had actually both briefly worked at the same office in London \u2014 the London Centre for International Law Practice \u2014 though at different times. That office was run by the \"professor\" described in court papers filed by the special counsel's office, a man later identified as the Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud.\n\nMifsud has previously worked in Malta's foreign ministry, and ran a university in Slovenia.\n\nHe has denied any connections to the Russian government and denied ever telling Papadopoulos about \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton, but since the fall, he has largely disappeared. He did not respond to NPR's requests for comment.\n\nMangiante's story is now providing new detail about Mifsud, but she acknowledges that he remains mysterious even to her.\n\nMangiante first got to know Mifsud when she worked as a legal adviser to the European Parliament, and he recruited her.\n\n\"He was interested to hire young people with political connections,\" she says, \"to have access to their networks.\"\n\nShe says she worked in Mifsud's London office for about three months, but to this day, she does not understand what she was supposed to do at the office. There was \"no work agenda,\" she says, and the office consisted of a single table and a rotating group of people working on their own laptops.\n\nAt one point, she says, she was asked to attend a \"secret symposium\" on Iraq, but the organizers would not tell her key details, like who else would be attending. She received a plane ticket, but decided not to go, given the secrecy.\n\nShe also says she was never paid for her work, and after three months, she decided to leave. (Mangiante shared her resignation letter with NPR, where she mentions the lack of pay.)\n\nFor nearly a year, Mangiante says her experience with Mifsud remained a bit of a mystery. But now that the U.S. government alleges that Mifsud had connections to the Russian government, she says \"it makes sense.\"\n\nSince the allegations came out, the London Centre for International Law Practice appears to have shut down. When NPR's Frank Langfitt recently tried to visit the office, he was turned away.\n\nMangiante says her relationship with Papadopoulos began around April 2017, and was \"love at first sight.\" A few months later, after a European vacation the young couple took, Papadopoulos was arrested after arriving at Dulles International Airport in the Washington, D.C., area. He later entered a guilty plea for lying to the FBI and is cooperating with authorities.\n\nMangiante says she has also been questioned by federal agents.\n\nShe says she cannot speak on behalf of Papadopoulos, on the advice of his lawyers. But she wants to correct the record about her fiance and his role on the campaign, which she says was much larger than the White House claims.\n\nFor one, Mangiante confirmed to NPR that Papadopoulos organized a meeting between Donald Trump and the president of Egypt during the campaign, a story first reported by the New York Times.\n\n\"I never heard of anybody bringing coffee and organizing meetings with presidents,\" she says.\n\nShe also confirmed that Papadopoulos helped edit Donald Trump's April 2016 foreign policy speech, where Trump said, \"I believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia - from a position of strength only - is possible. Absolutely possible.\"\n\nWhen NPR asked if everything Papadopoulos did during the campaign was authorized by the top levels of the campaign, she responded unequivocally:\n\n\"Yes. That's my understanding.\"\n\nShe also says it will be \"easy to prove\" how significant Papadopoulos' role was, because \"all of his communication, professional communication with other people with the campaign [was] via email.\"\n\nOnce Papadopoulos is sentenced for lying to the FBI, Mangiante says he will finally be able to tell his side of the story. \"After sentencing, he will definitely talk,\" she says. \"And he will say everything I can't say.\"\n\nIn the meantime, she is spending time with Papadopoulos in his hometown of Chicago.\n\nAnd she recently made a new purchase.\n\n\"I bought for George a coffee machine,\" she says, \"and he was laughing at me.

The National Association of Royalty Owners estimates some 12 million American landowners receive royalties for the exploitation of oil, gas and other mineral resources under their property.\n\nBut as U.S. production reaches record levels \u2014 it recently surpassed the previous high point in 1970 \u2014 a complex web of laws and court rulings is evolving over how these royalties are distributed. That's creating vast differences in how much money property owners actually get and prompting a number of lawsuits accusing energy companies of shortchanging them.\n\nThis disparity is playing out across Pennsylvania's gas-rich Marcellus Shale.\n\nWhen natural gas companies approached Charlie Clark and Jim Barrett, two farmers living in neighboring counties, both decided to let them drill.\n\nClark says it felt like he had \"won the lottery,\" and he is grateful every day for the two gas wells drilled on his dairy farm. He estimates he receives about $10,000 per month in the form of gas royalties.\n\n\"This is what we've done with our gas money,\" Clark says, standing in his new barn filled with cows. \"This barn here cost $40,000 to build it, and we were able to build it out of our pocket.\"\n\nWhen he was growing up in rural Susquehanna County in the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, his family used to scrimp and save just to buy basics, like new shoes.\n\nNow, since the drilling rigs rolled into town and he started receiving royalty checks, Clark has a newfound sense of financial security.\n\n\"We're living like we used to, but without the stress,\" Clark says. \"The bills are all paid. Your kid's gotta go to college? No problem.\"\n\nHe's a good example of when the royalty process works. It goes like this: Gas companies and landowners sign a lease agreement before drilling begins. The royalty is money paid to the mineral owner, like Clark, for the right to use his resource. It's negotiated to be a certain percentage of the revenue from the sale of the gas.\n\nClark is leased to a company called Chief Oil and Gas. The company gets gas it needs, and Clark gets paid. But he knows other people with similar gas wells are striking out.\n\n\"I thank God every day that it happened here,\" he says, and not a few miles to the west.\n\nThat's where Jim Barrett lives, about 40 miles away in Bradford County on what he describes as \"a pretty typical mountain farm.\"\n\nLike Clark, he is grateful for the drilling.\n\n\"It kept Bradford County alive,\" he says. If not for the gas industry, he says, his community \"would have been a ghost town in 2008 or 2010\" after the Great Recession.\n\nBut for Barrett, the gas boom has not panned out the way he had hoped.\n\nHe says Chesapeake Energy, which operates four wells on his farm, is stealing from him, and he has joined a class-action lawsuit against the company. Chesapeake, which declined to comment for this story, is defending itself against lawsuits in at least seven states for allegedly underpaying royalties.\n\nBy Barrett's calculations, Chesapeake owes him hundreds of thousands of dollars for the gas it has pumped out of his farm. The company has said in the past that it is committed to working with its royalty owners to answer questions.\n\nClark and Barrett might have started out with similar hopes, but their different experiences show how tough it can be for landowners to navigate the gas business and how resolutions are hard to come by.\n\nMuch of the controversy surrounding royalty money boils down to a concept known as post-production costs: the expenses of moving and treating gas through a network of pipelines. To cover the costs, drillers might take deductions from royalty checks.\n\nSome landowners agree to that, while others negotiate a lease that prohibits it, says attorney John McFarland, who represents landowners with the Texas-based law firm Graves, Dougherty, Hearon and Moody. Many others sign leases that don't address it at all. Even when possible deductions are addressed, McFarland says, the lease language can be vague. That leaves room for a gas company to take deductions even if a landowner objects.\n\nDisputes over post-production costs have popped up all over the country as oil and gas production has soared, the result of new horizontal drilling and fracking technologies that allow drillers to tap into shale rock.\n\nBy 2014, the United States was producing so much oil and gas that it led to a global oversupply. That's when complaints over these deductions really started to roll in, says Gary Preszler, vice president of the National Association of Royalty Owners board.\n\nMany energy-producing states took a hit during the downturn, as companies went bankrupt, workers were laid off, and tax revenue collected from oil and gas dropped. In most of them, like North Dakota, where Preszler lives, wells produce both oil and gas. When prices plummeted, oil suddenly wasn't worth what it used to be, he says, but the gas still needed to be transported and treated, and that cost stayed constant.\n\n\"That's when people saw their checks being reduced significantly,\" he says. Some even received statements with a negative balance, meaning they wouldn't receive more royalties until the balance turned positive again.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, wells produce mainly gas, so landowners like Barrett noticed right away when companies took out big, unexplained cuts. Some Pennsylvania landowners have been complaining for years about exorbitant deductions. Still, many never have a reason to complain. Clark, for example, says he feels his deductions are reasonable.\n\nOver the years, some landowners sued when they felt they were being cheated. That has led to a patchwork of court rulings in many states, determining how leases are interpreted.\n\nSome landowners hire a lawyer to negotiate a lease with explicit language that prohibits deductions or spells out exactly which costs can be taken out. The greater stake an individual has in a well, the more bargaining power he or she has to negotiate a lease that works in his or her favor, says University of Texas law professor Owen Anderson.\n\nBut not all go that route.\n\n\"As often happens, these landowners and mineral owners sign these leases the company offers without negotiating terms and without getting legal advice,\" Anderson says.\n\nLater, if they believe they're not getting paid fairly, their options are slim. They can hire an expert to audit their royalties and go to court, but some can't afford to do that.\n\nPreszler says the better option is to prevent landowners from signing bad leases.\n\n\"It's a lot easier to try to get the terms correctly done at the front end than to try to manage and fix a problem later,\" he says. His group is developing a seminar to better educate landowners.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, a decades-old law guarantees a minimum 12.5 percent royalty. But the state's Supreme Court has ruled that deductions can still be taken, even if they cut into that rate. For four years, mineral owners have pushed to keep that from happening, but so far the Legislature has not passed a bill.\n\nIt's a different story in West Virginia, where royalty owners just scored a victory. Lawmakers did step in after the state Supreme Court sided with energy companies in a case last year. Now, the governor has signed a new law prohibiting gas and oil companies from deducting post-production expenses in certain types of leases.\n\nMeanwhile, lawsuits are playing out in several states, including one brought by Pennsylvania's attorney general accusing several gas companies of stiffing thousands of landowners by promising royalty money that was never paid. So far, he has not agreed to an offer by Chesapeake Energy to settle its royalty cases in the state for $30 million.\n\nBack on his farm in Susquehanna County, Clark says even though he is pleased with his gas royalties, he thinks the law should ensure everyone is paid fairly.\n\n\"I guess I really don't understand why the government hasn't stepped in and done a little bit more, because it would benefit them too,\" he says. \"Any extra money we'd get, we'd be taxed on.\"\n\nOver in Bradford County, Barrett just wants to protect his family's legacy. \"Every farmer would say they want their farm to continue,\" he says.\n\nBarrett's land was passed down from his great-grandfather, and he hopes to hand it over to his grandchildren. But without the royalty money he expected, he and his wife may have to sell the farm to retire.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Geoff Brumfiel", "body": "Today, the Trump administration released a report on the state of America's nuclear weaponry. The assessment, known as a Nuclear Posture Review, mainly concerns U.S. nukes and missiles.\n\nBut buried in the plan is a mention of a mysterious Russian weapon called \"Status-6.\" On paper, at least, Status-6 appears to be a kind of doomsday device. The report refers to it as \"a new intercontinental, nuclear-armed, nuclear-powered, undersea autonomous torpedo.\"\n\n\"The radius of total or near-total destruction is the size of a pretty large metropolitan area, actually,\" says Edward Geist, a Russia specialist at the RAND Corporation who has spent time looking at the weapon. \"It's difficult to imagine in normal terms.\"\n\nStatus-6 made its first public appearance in 2015, while Russian President Vladimir Putin was visiting with his generals in the city of Sochi.\n\nRussia state television reported on the visit. The camera shows Putin seated at a long table. Then it cuts to a shot over one of the general's shoulders. He's looking at what appears to be a drawing of a new nuclear weapon called the Oceanic Multipurpose System Status-6.\n\nStatus-6 looks like a giant torpedo about a third the length of a big Russian submarine. According to the slide, it is nuclear-powered, meaning it can roam for months and even possibly years beneath the ocean without surfacing. Its payload is a nuclear warhead \"many tens of megatons in yield,\" Geist says.\n\nThat's thousands of times more powerful than the bombs dropped at the end of World War II and more powerful than anything currently in the U.S. and Russian arsenals.\n\nStatus-6 would launch from beneath a Russian submarine. It would shoot at a depth too deep to be intercepted, and travel for thousands of miles. Upon reaching its target along the U.S. coastline, it would detonate, swallowing up whatever city happened to be nearby.\n\n\"The only possible U.S. targets are large port cities,\" says Mark Schneider, a senior analyst with the National Institute for Public Policy wrote in an e-mail. \"The detonation of Status-6 in any of them would essentially wipe out their population into the far suburbs.\"\n\n\"The detonation would cause a very large amount of radioactive fallout,\" adds Pavel Podvig, an arms control expert who runs a blog called Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces. Podvig believes the weapon could potentially bathe the entire Northeast Corridor in radioactive soot.\n\nStatus-6 would probably be used as a \"third-strike\" weapon of last resort. If Russia fell under attack from the U.S. and couldn't retaliate with its missiles, it might trigger Status-6: A doomsday machine. Or at least a doomsday-ish machine.\n\nThen again, the whole thing might be a fake.\n\n\"The drawing of this drone looks more like an enlarged drawing of a smaller torpedo,\" says Podvig. In other words, it looks like the Russians may have just taken some torpedo clip-art, blown it up to terrifying size and then broadcast it on state television.\n\n\"It's a way to get our attention,\" says Geist.\n\nGeist says that the \"leak\" of Status-6 was deliberate. Russia worries that U.S. missile defenses might be able to shoot down its missiles in a nuclear war. By showing a plan for Status-6, Russia is warning the U.S. that if it continues to build such defensive systems, then Russia will find another way to strike: one that can't be intercepted.\n\n\"My read of the whole Status-6 slide leak is that the Russians were trying to send us a message,\" Geist says.\n\nPodvig agrees that the leak of Status-6 is probably just a warning shot. But the fact it appeared in the Pentagon's newest report on nuclear weapons shows that some war planners are taking the idea seriously.\n\nThere may be some politics involved in that decision as well, says Hans Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists. The Trump administration is pushing hard for upgrades to America's nuclear arsenal. In his State of the Union address, the president called for making the arsenal \"so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression by any other nation or anyone else.\"\n\nCiting Status-6 helps to build the case that upgrades to American nukes are needed, Kristensen says.\n\nFor all the rhetoric around Status-6, Podvig and Geist both believe that the program isn't completely made-up. Geist says a long-range underwater drone without a nuclear warhead would be a useful weapon.\n\n\"You could use it for tapping our underwater communications cables,\" he says. \"Or simpler, in a war, is just going out and like finding them and cutting them.\"\n\nStatus-6 could also carry conventional munitions, like cruise missiles, and launch them after hiding for months beneath the water.\n\nPodvig has seen photos which he says indicate the Russians are working on some hardware for big underwater drones.\n\n\"My best guess is that there is there is a project to design an underwater vehicle with a purpose, unknown at this point,\" he says. \"There is something there.\"", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Carrie Johnson", "body": "Paul Manafort Pleads Not Guilty To Conspiracy, Tax And Bank Fraud Charges\n\nFormer Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort pleaded not guilty to conspiracy, tax and bank fraud charges in an Alexandria, Va., federal court Thursday afternoon.\n\nManafort faces a separate federal trial on September 17, 2018, on other charges also brought by special counsel Robert Mueller's office in a Washington, D.C., case.\n\nFor the Virginia case, Manafort will be fitted with a second electronic monitoring bracelet (he is already wearing one related to the D.C. case) and will be allowed to meet with lawyers, attend church services and make emergency medical trips as needed.\n\nJudge Ellis, who has been on the bench for 31 years, alternately cracked jokes and pressed lawyers for Manafort and Mueller's office on their legal positions.\n\nThe judge urged prosecutors to add a lawyer to their team experienced in practicing in the Eastern District of Virginia federal court where the Alexandria, Va., courthouse is located. \"Only a fool would try a case in a jurisdiction he's unfamiliar with, without local counsel,\" the judge said, citing wisdom of his mentor Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell.\n\nThe judge also pressed the special counsel's team about why it had brought so many charges against Manafort \u2014 18 \u2014 and whether the government case could be streamlined.\n\nProsecutor Andrew Weissmann said his case would likely take 8 to 10 trial days and involve 20 to 25 witnesses.\n\nBut Judge Ellis also pushed Manafort's defense team, which resisted a quick trial date.

Rick Saccone. The GOP nominee got an 11th-hour rescue-mission visit Saturday from President Trump, who carried the district by about 20 points in the 2016 presidential election. GOP-allied groups have poured in more than $10 million to help Saccone, who's underwhelmed in fundraising. If that's not enough to save him, it would be an embarrassing and alarming loss for Republicans eight months from the midterm elections.\n\nMeanwhile, even Republicans privately concede that Democratic nominee Connor Lamb \u2014 a charismatic, young former Marine and prosecutor \u2014 is the superior recruit. He's brought in far more money than the GOP candidate in this traditionally solidly red district near Pittsburgh. Lamb has raised $3 million in the race, while Democratic outside groups stayed mostly on the sidelines. They have put in only about $1.7 million, allowing Lamb to run a more independent race.\n\nLamb has cut a moderate profile with a populist tinge. He has said he would oppose Nancy Pelosi as Democratic leader and has also wooed steel workers, coal miners and union activists in this blue-collar districts. He's had a somewhat similar economic message to Trump when he campaigned and won here.\n\nThis special election was triggered by the resignation of former Rep. Tim Murphy, who stepped down after it was revealed that the anti-abortion rights congressman had an extramarital affair and pressured his mistress to terminate a possible pregnancy.\n\nDue to court-ordered redistricting, the district as it's drawn now will cease to exist come Election Day 2018, and neither Saccone nor Lamb will even live in the rejiggered seat. So the fact that Republicans are spending so heavily to save what's essentially a phantom district underscores what is on the line: They don't want a loss in such a GOP stronghold to spur even more panic among their ranks that Trump is dragging them down.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats are salivating for an upset that will further galvanize their energetic base hoping for a blue wave in November. To this point, since Trump has been president, Republicans have underperformed in GOP-held House special elections, but still won all five of them.\n\nPolls close at 8 p.m. ET. Here are four questions to ponder in the meantime:\n\n1. Will this be a canary in the coal mine for the GOP?\n\nA few months ago, when a rash of retirements seemed like the latest alarm bells for Republicans, GOP strategists urged caution. Some pointed to this Pennsylvania race \u2014 where Saccone was still heavily favored \u2014 as the possible canary in the coal mine to watch for Republicans. This race, they said, could be a much bigger sign of danger ahead for the GOP.\n\nIf Lamb does win on Tuesday night, it could send even more GOP members of Congress heading for the exits, adding to what's already a record number of retirements.\n\nThe ominous signs have been there for some time for Republicans. Since Trump's election, 39 state legislative races have flipped from red to blue. Democrats notched big wins last November in both the Virginia and New Jersey governor's races.\n\nAnd special House elections last year across the board showed a major shift toward Democrats, even if they didn't notch a victory in a GOP-held race yet. Republicans have far underperformed in special elections in Kansas, Montana and South Carolina \u2014 all solidly GOP territory.\n\nDemocrats did score a major upset in December in the Alabama Senate race, flipping a seat in a state that Trump carried by nearly 30 points. In that contest, Republicans were running a deeply flawed candidate in GOP nominee Roy Moore, long a controversial figure in state Republican circles. Several women accused him of sexual misconduct and pursuing them romantically when they were teenagers, and he was much older.\n\nRepublicans are already trying to paint Saccone as a weak candidate, but blaming him for underperforming is hardly a credible excuse in such a Republican area. It would instead be a sure sign of danger ahead, at least in the narrative that would form about 2018, what it would mean for GOP morale, fundraising and the power of the president to help candidates over the line.\n\nNo race is a perfect predictor, and Republicans will also surely note that before their own massive wave in 2010 that helped them capture control of the House, there was another Pennsylvania special election that went Democrats' way. That race certainly was no sign of their fortunes come November.\n\nStill, there's been more than enough evidence in the 16 months since Trump was elected that the energy on the Democratic side is very real. Now, a Lamb win would mean that even areas that were once considered safe GOP territory might no longer be.\n\nTrump rode into town Saturday night in nearby Moon Township to campaign for Saccone. He had a trademark wild and unpredictable rally to help Saccone. He boasted that he was able to help save the Georgia special election in a similar fashion and later tweeted about it:\n\nThe president even gave the Democratic nominee his own Trump-branded nickname, \"Lamb the sham.\" He made the case for Saccone, who has run as an unabashedly pro-Trump candidate, before turning to a myriad other topics and insults.\n\nIt was all classic Trump \u2014 eager to claim credit despite scant evidence he helped move many poll numbers, as in Georgia. He didn't mention other places where he's gone in and lost \u2014 like Alabama, where he first backed the losing primary candidate and then failed to get Moore across the finish line.\n\nFor Trump, every day is Nov. 8, 2016. He revels in reliving that historic night and boasting of his unexpected victory over Hillary Clinton. But now Tuesday night could show if Trump's winning coalition is transferable to other candidates \u2014 or not.\n\nDemocrats faced a similar problem under President Obama. As NPR's Domenico Montanaro calculated, when Obama was on the ballot, Democrats gained 31 seats in the House and nine in the Senate. When he wasn't, the party lost 82 seats in the House and 17 in the Senate.\n\nObama's popularity dropped during his tenure, and he was, indeed, a drag on his own party in 2010 after the Affordable Care Act passed. But Obama's numbers were stronger than Trump's, and there wasn't the constant chaos and scandal plaguing the White House.\n\nUltimately, Trump's unpopularity, remains the biggest detriment for Republicans in the midterms. It raises the question of how Trump could be \u2014 or is willing to not be \u2014 dispatched on behalf of Republicans on the trail over the coming months. That will be even more acute if Saccone loses. Even in places like the Rust Belt where he was once seen as an asset may not be a given any longer.\n\nWhile Trump doesn't like to be associated with anything losing, he also never passes up a chance to get before a crowd. So while he may salivate at campaigning more, it could be hard for anyone in the GOP to make the case to the president he would hurt more than help.\n\nRepublicans have already been trying to downplay expectations ahead of a loss too, with Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Val DiGiorgio making the stunning argument on Fox News Monday that \"this is a Democrat district\" despite Trump's heavy win \u2014 even though past GOP presidential nominees also performed similarly and Murphy routinely won re-election easily, or even went unopposed. A Democrats hasn't won here in 15 years.\n\n3. Can the economy and tax bill save Republicans \u2014 or not?\n\nThe silver bullet for Republicans in the midterms could be the positive economy \u2014 and the GOP tax cuts they passed last year that are growing in popularity.\n\nYet that argument wasn't used much in the final stretch to help Saccone in Pennsylvania. Early ads touted economic growth and the tax overhaul, while hitting Lamb for downplaying the impact of the tax cuts. But in the final stretch, that message was abandoned for much more ominous ads hammering Lamb over immigration and crime.\n\nThat was the same dark turn Republicans took in Virginia last fall \u2014 a gambit that failed. So if that's their closing message, it's a sign that the political boon they hoped to gain from an economic boom might not be working. And, as much as Democrats haven't figured out messaging on the tax bill, Republicans may not have either.\n\nOne of the unknowns is how the recently announced tariffs could affect the race. Areas like the 18th district, where blue-collar Democrats crossed party lines to vote for Trump, have been hard hit in an age of globalization. Trump's imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum would seem to be tailor-made to boost political support in economically distressed areas like this.\n\nHowever, a Monmouth University poll (taken before Trump's visit), which showed Lamb with a narrow lead \u2014 both under regular- and high-turnout scenarios \u2014 found the tariff announcement didn't seem to sway voters at all. Plus, both Saccone and Lamb have been supportive of the tariffs.\n\nLamb has run a more centrist campaign and underscored local issues. That has helped him close the gap and win crossover Republicans. But this race is also a test of whether Democrats can blunt what has been one of Republicans' most effective weapons \u2014 Nancy Pelosi.\n\nLamb has run ads boasting of how he would oppose Pelosi as Democrats' House leader \u2014 or even speaker \u2014 if he's elected, echoing pushes by like-minded legislators such as Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan and Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton in calling for new leadership. And the surrogates he's had campaign for him, like former Vice President Joe Biden, have a much different appeal to voters in this area than the San Franciscan could.\n\nNevertheless, Republicans have been repeatedly able to turn Pelosi into a political bogeyman, dragging down surging candidates by tying her to them. It was a strategy they first employed successfully in 2010 \u2014 and replicated it. They most recently used it in last year's Georgia special election.\n\nAds from outside GOP-aligned groups have continued to argue that Lamb would still be a Pelosi lackey even though he says now he wants new leadership. But if Lamb is able to survive being linked to Pelosi, it could be an encouraging sign for Democratic candidates across the country, some of whom have already signaled they want new leadership, as well.\n\nPelosi remains a fundraising machine for the Democrats, and she still wields considerable influence. But if Democrats want to win back the House, a Lamb win might show they need more candidates like the Pennsylvanian in conservative areas who are willing to buck the status quo and go against party leadership.\n\nAnd that could raise even more questions of who will be in the leader's chair come 2019.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Carrie Johnson", "body": "Trump Pick For Sentencing Commission Has History Of Racially Charged Remarks\n\nOne of President Trump's picks for a seat on the body that sets policy used to punish 70,000 federal criminals every year has publicly called to abolish the U.S. Sentencing Commission and has a history of making racially charged remarks about crime.\n\nWilliam G.

They also expressed their opposition online under the hashtag #letitflow.\n\n\"We know that this bill really struck a nerve,\" Salman said on Monday as she made an appeal for support for the bill.\n\nOne day later, the Department of Corrections acknowledged the campaign in announcing the change, saying it, \"appreciates and values the comments and feedback it has received in recent days regarding sanitary napkin products provided to female inmates.\"\n\nFor his part Shope said he is glad for the change.\n\n\"Every human being is deserving of respect,\" he said in a statement published by CNN. \"When I first became aware of this issue, I reached out to (the Arizona Department of Corrections) and urged them to explore changing the policy, as an administrative change can be implemented much quicker than a change in statute.\"\n\nRobbie Sherwood, spokesman for Arizona House Democrats, told CNN that they are no longer pushing for HB 2222 this session, since they view the department's policy change as a victory.\n\nBut Salman said she is not letting down her vigilance: she wants to see the policy codified so that it cannot be undone following a change in leadership and she said she wants to make sure it is implemented as promised.\n\n\"I also have a commitment from the governor's office to explore expanding the policy to include tampons,\" she said in a statement on Thursday.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Nina Totenberg", "body": "From 'Fraud' To Individual Right, Where Does The Supreme Court Stand On Guns?\n\nIn the wake of the deadly Parkland shooting, attention has focused on legislation that could make its way through Congress and the Florida state legislature.\n\nBut what does the U.S. Supreme Court have to say about gun control? After a couple of important cases nearly a decade ago, the court has, for the most part, turned away cases challenging gun laws.\n\nSo why the reluctance, what's the history and is the right to bear arms an absolute one?\n\nFrom a \"fraud\" on the American public to an individual right\n\nFor most of American legal history, the consensus was that the right to bear arms was not an individual right, but rather a right for those called to military service, the militia.\n\nFormer Chief Justice Warren Burger, a conservative, said the idea that there was an individual right to bear arms was \"a fraud.\" If he were writing the Bill of Rights now, he said in 1991, \"There wouldn't be any such thing as the Second Amendment.\"\n\nHe declared on PBS that the Second Amendment \"has been the subject of one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word fraud, on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.\"\n\nBut that all changed with some scholarly work and cases brought by gun-rights advocates.\n\nIn 2008, in District of Columbia v. Heller, the court said there is an individual constitutional right to have a handgun in one's home for self-protection. Two years later, in a second case, the court made clear that its decision applied to the states, as well as the federal government.\n\nNot an absolute right\n\nThe court has never said, however, that the right to bear arms in this country is absolute.\n\nIn declaring an individual right to bear arms, the court made clear that there are limitations on that right, just as there are limitations on other constitutional rights.\n\nThere is a First Amendment right to free speech, but someone can't yell \"fire!\" in a crowded theater. And a person can't parade loudly through a residential area at 2 a.m. either.\n\nSimilarly, the court said in 2008 that the right to bear arms doesn't bar the government from regulating firearms.\n\nThe justices specifically said the government can ban firearms for felons or the mentally ill; it can ban guns in sensitive places, like schools and government buildings; and the government can impose conditions and qualifications for the commercial sale of guns.\n\nIn addition, the court also seemed to say that \"particularly dangerous and unusual weapons,\" such as military-style assault weapons, could be prohibited.\n\nThe court has certainly had the opportunity to say more on guns in recent years. But it's turned away numerous gun cases since Heller.\n\nJust last month, for example, the court refused to hear a case testing California's 10-day waiting period to buy a gun. Justice Clarence Thomas was the only dissenter, and he accused the court of turning the right to bear arms into a \"disfavored\" constitutional right.\n\nLast June, he and Trump-appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch dissented when the court refused to hear a challenge to a general ban on concealed carry weapons outside the home.\n\nAnd in the years before that, the court refused to hear challenges to bans on assault weapons, bans on weapons for someone who is the subject of a protection order in a domestic dispute, and more.\n\nThere are two cases the court ruled on recently. One was to uphold a law banning a gun for anyone convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Justice Thomas dissented from that one, as did Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in part.\n\nIn 2014, the court, by a 5-to-4 vote upheld a strict ban on the straw purchase of firearms \u2014that is, if, for instance, someone has a record of domestic violence and wouldn't be allowed to buy a gun, but a family member or friend buys one for that person.\n\nAnd there's no indication the court is anxious to take up more gun cases any time soon. There are two possible explanations for this continued refusal to act \u2014 (1) That the court believes it laid down guidelines in its 2008 Heller decision, and would just as soon stay out of this, and (2) More likely, neither side \u2014 those justices who believe that the Constitution allows strict gun laws or those who think that such gun control laws are unconstitutional \u2014 is sure they have the votes to prevail if the court takes up these issues.\n\nAfter all, Heller was 5-to-4, with Justice Anthony Kennedy the deciding vote. And it has long been assumed that the caveats in the decision were the price of his vote.\n\nThere is, of course, a third possible explanation for the failure to take up gun cases: that some justices, especially in light of current circumstances, have evolving views on this subject.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Domenico Montanaro", "body": "President Trump certainly has a flair for the dramatic.\n\nThe announcement Thursday night that the president of the United States had accepted an invitation to meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un shocked the world.\n\nThat's the kind of phrase that's overused \u2014 in politics and sports in particular \u2014 but it's appropriate in this case.\n\n\"This is quite extraordinary,\" former U.S. Ambassador Chris Hill told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly on All Things Considered Thursday night. Hill represented the U.S. in multilateral talks with North Korea during the George W. Bush  because no other sitting U.S. presidents has met with a North Korean leader. (Jimmy Carter met with then-North Korean leader Kim Il Sung in 1994 as a former president, and former President Bill Clinton traveled to North Korea and met with Kim Jong Il in 2009 to negotiate the release of two journalists.)\n\nExtraordinary because the rhetoric between the countries has been heated in recent months with President Trump referring to Kim as \"Little Rocket Man\" and a \"madman,\" and Kim referring to Trump as a \"lunatic\" and \"loser.\"\n\nExtraordinary because few realistically thought this could happen. Trump has said in the past he would be open to meeting with Kim, but on Tuesday when asked about the possibility, he was noncommittal. \"We're going to see what happens,\" he said.\n\nThe surprise nature of the announcement gave the impression of an ad hoc gambit rather than a careful, well-thought out approach to dealing with an unpredictable nuclear regime.\n\nIn diplomacy, it comes with incredible risk to subject a principal to a one-on-one meeting where results aren't guaranteed \u2014 or at least close. Typically, spade work is done by lower-level experts for months, if not years.\n\nTrump is banking on the power of his personality for a breakthrough. But some recent domestic examples provide little evidence Trump will deal with this particularly thorny issue masterfully.\n\nAfter Trump's televised meetings on immigration and guns, participants were left confused. Instead of command performances, there was disorganization and a lack of policy depth.\n\nWhat's more, the Trump administration's stance on North Korea has been something of a whiplash. Washington, with Trump's backing, has pushed for ramping up sanctions against Pyongyang. And the White House reportedly scoffed at the State Department's special envoy who tried to pursue direct talks late last year.\n\n\"He's such a dreamer,\" one White House official told Reuters sarcastically of State's point man on North Korea, Joseph Yun.\n\nSeemingly out of frustration with a lack of effort at pursuing direct diplomacy and a peaceful solution, Yun retired \u2014 just last week.\n\nWhen it comes to an issue as dangerous and delicate as North Korea, this isn't how it's normally done. At the same time, Trump's theory of everything is that the way it's always been done hasn't worked, so let's try something else.\n\nThat high-risk, high-reward approach has its skeptics, but not everyone is dismissing it out of hand.\n\n\"We were quickly heading down the road to a possible military confrontation with the North Koreans and a major step towards diplomacy is a most welcome turn of events,\" Suzanne DiMaggio, senior fellow at the think tank New America, said on NPR's Morning Edition Friday.\n\nHill, the former U.S. negotiator on North Korea, said Trump's out-of-the-box stance may very well have been what spurred this.\n\n\"Frankly, he may be right about some of this, because it was pretty clear that the U.S. was kind of going relentlessly on this issue,\" Hill said on All Things Considered. \"And he's such a \u2014 how to put it \u2014 different kind of president that \u2014 he seemed to be prepared to talk about things that other presidents have not been prepared to talk about.\n\n\"For example, in Washington the last few weeks, there's been a discussion about the so-called bloody nose and the idea that somehow we could launch some kind of strike against the North Koreans,\" he added. \"So it could be that this kind of attitude unconstrained by what anyone in the past has done kind of gave the North Koreans pause.\"\n\nDiMaggio and others said preparation and expectations-setting are going to prove important. In particular, the president should stop raising the bar for the possibility that the North will give up its nuclear program entirely, like the White House and the president did Thursday.\n\n\"We look forward to the denuclearization of North Korea,\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. \"In the meantime, all sanctions and maximum pressure must remain.\"\n\nThe president then tweeted that Kim \"talked about denuclearization ... not just a freeze.\"\n\n\"We need to go into the mindset that this is going to be a long, arduous process,\" DiMaggio said. \"The North Koreans are not going to give up their nuclear program anytime soon. They may well never give it up. ... We need to really get in place the priorities that we want to achieve in the near term.\"\n\nBut the expectations horse may have already left the barn. Here was Colorado Republican Sen. Cory Gardner on NPR's Morning Edition: \"If the president of the United States meets with Kim Jong Un and does not walk away with what should be those concrete steps towards denuclearization, then I don't see how it's any closer to the kind of peace on the peninsula that we have been seeking.\"\n\nHill cautioned against that mindset, saying there need to be other attainable goals on the table. \"It's important to get down all the steps with the last one being complete denuclearization,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think we're going to get an absolute goal of denuclearization,\" Bill Richardson, a Democrat and former ambassador who has been to North Korea eight times, said on CNN Friday. \"I think the president needs to temper that.\"\n\n\"Risks need to be mitigated by very good staff work\"\n\nPreparation is key, experts agree, but the staffing situation in the White House and at the State Department makes observers nervous.\n\n\"What's important,\" Hill said, \"is the U.S. has some clear understanding of what goes forward, because a presidential meeting is kind of coin of the realm, and the idea that we are just going to have a pause in their testing without really concrete understandings of what goes forward \u2014 that's risky, and those risks need to be mitigated by very good staff work.\"\n\nWhen it comes to that staff work, there are some danger signs. Diplomatic experts have been sidelined in this administration. As NPR diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen points out, there is a thin bench at the State Department currently when it comes to dealing with North Korea \u2014 not only did Yun retire, someone who joined the foreign service in 1985, but there is also no assistant secretary of state for East Asia (she's currently going through her confirmation process). Trump still hasn't nominated an ambassador to South Korea.\n\nA career diplomat is currently serving in that role, which can be a good thing, but all of it points to unsteadiness and inconsistency at the staff level, and in talks with a rogue regime, one false move can have massive ripple effects and unintended consequences.\n\nWhat's more, when the announcement came down, it was the deputy secretary of state at the White House, not Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. He is currently in Africa. He said this was not a \"surprise,\" but he also signaled that Trump made the decision on his own.\n\nThis was \"a decision the President took himself,\" Tillerson said, per CNN, in Djibouti, a day after Tillerson questioned \"whether conditions are right\" for negotiations.\n\n\"We're a long way from negotiations,\" Tillerson said in Ethiopia Thursday. \"We just need to be very clear-eyed and realistic about it. I don't know yet, until we are able to meet ourselves face to face with representatives of North Korea, whether the conditions are right to even begin thinking about negotiations.\"\n\nOn Friday, though, Tillerson was put in the position of trying to walk a very fine line between the words negotiations \u2013 and talks.\n\n\"With respect to talks with North Korea versus negotiations,\" he said, \"and I think this seems to be something that people continue to struggle with the difference \u2014 my comments have been that the conditions are not right for negotiations.\"\n\nCan Trump stick to the script?\n\nEither way, talks or negotiations with North Korea are high stakes, especially when the president is involved. And this president, in particular, has had trouble sticking to the script.\n\n\"His primary problem is sticking to talking points and really laying the kind of groundwork that has to be laid for the kind of serious negotiations that are going to take place,\" former Obama Defense Secretary and CIA Director Leon Panetta told CNN.\n\n\"It's risky,\" Richardson said. \"We've got to be properly prepared, and we cannot underestimate Kim Jong Un. He's evolving into a strategic thinker, into a man with an end game.\"\n\nTo that point, congressional Republicans are sharpening their sabers.\n\n\"I do believe that North Korea now believes President Trump will use military force if he has to,\" South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said in a statement. \"A word of warning to North Korean President Kim Jong Un \u2014 the worst possible thing you can do is meet with President Trump in person and try to play him. If you do that, it will be the end of you \u2014 and your regime.\"\n\nStill, while Trump agreeing to a meeting surprised almost everyone and didn't relieve skepticism, experts welcomed the news.\n\n\"This is a positive step,\" Panetta said. \"The world is breathing a sigh of relief as a result of having these negotiations, even having this kind of meeting.\"\n\nBut they warned about something else: \"One of the first priorities is going to have to be how to soundproof this process from President Trump's tweets and rants,\" DiMaggio said, \"otherwise we are going to be in for a rocky road ahead.\"\n\nOr, as Richardson put it: \"I think this is big stakes, a big gamble, but I'm supporting the president's effort to do it.

A year into office, Trump's approval ratings are at record-low levels, and a majority of Americans see his first year as a failure.\n\nA scripted speech like the State of the Union, with dedicated air time, gives Trump a prime opportunity to lay out his agenda and try to set a new tone.\n\nThe theme of the speech will be \"building a safe, strong and proud America,\" a senior administration official told reporters, and the president will tout his \"record-setting\" accomplishments, which are \"lifting all Americans.\" The speech will reflect on his first year in office and highlight the country's economic upswing.\n\nThe official said the speech will be forward-looking and optimistic, much in the vein of Trump's first address to Congress in February 2017, shortly after he was inaugurated, when he called for the \"renewal of the American spirit.\"\n\nTuesday night, Trump is expected to focus on five major policy areas: jobs and the economy, infrastructure, immigration, trade and national security. The president is expected to unveil some new policy proposals, though the official would not elaborate on what those would be.\n\nThe economy will be a major facet of Trump's look back. The president will tout the tax law passed in December by Congress, his administration's deregulation efforts and stock market gains.\n\nIn the NPR poll, 45 percent of Americans said the economy has improved under Trump, who inherited an upward economic trajectory from former President Barack Obama. The economy didn't grow as quickly in the final quarter of 2017 as many economists had projected, though.\n\nStill, the economy is one mark that can work in the president's favor, and Republicans \u2014 especially heading into the 2018 midterms \u2014 hope that bonuses and higher paychecks resulting from the tax law will help boost voters come November.\n\nOn infrastructure, the president will outline his $1 trillion plan to rebuild the country's roads, bridges and more \u2014 something he has long hoped to champion in Congress. Such an effort could draw bipartisan support, but has so far lacked specifics.\n\nImmigration will also be a critical component, with the White House proposing to offer protections for people in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA, which is set to expire March 5. Under the plan outlined to congressional Republicans this week, the White House would support a 10- to 12-year path to citizenship for the roughly 700,000 undocumented immigrants currently enrolled in DACA who came to the country as children. The proposal would also offer that path to others who were eligible for DACA but not currently enrolled, which could be up to 1.8 million people in total.\n\nThe White House also wants $25 billion for Trump's proposed Southern border wall and other border security measures, along with an end to the visa lottery system and changes to policies by which immigrants legally in the U.S. are allowed to sponsor extended family members.\n\nThose cuts to legal immigration in exchange for a DACA deal have been a nonstarter with many Democrats. At the same time, many in the president's conservative base are upset that he would offer any path to citizenship for DACA recipients and the broader group of immigrants known as DREAMers.\n\nTrump will also talk about trade, which has been a key part of his populist platform and a theme of past speeches, including recently at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. On Friday, Trump defended his \"America First\" approach to trade, saying that while the U.S. supports free trade, \"it needs to be fair and it needs to be reciprocal.\"\n\nTrump pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal when he came to the White House. His administration is also working on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement; Trump has, at times, suggested leaving NAFTA altogether.\n\nThe president is expected to touch on themes similar to his Davos speech and to the remarks he gave last November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit, where he said, \"The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to violations, cheating, or economic aggression. Those days are over.\"\n\nThe final key part of Trump's speech will focus on national security, including efforts to rebuild the military and deal with foreign threats such as ISIS \u2014 another effort where he's received positive marks from Americans \u2014 North Korea and others. On North Korea, Trump has a record of using controversial rhetoric, including taunting North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un as \"Little Rocket Man\" and comparing the size of the countries' \"nuclear buttons.\"\n\nHistorically, few promises that presidents lay out in these speeches ever get implemented, as PBS NewsHour noted in 2015. The speeches rarely change anyone's minds, either, Gallup reported in 2010: \"Audiences for the State of the Union tend to be heavily tilted toward the president's existing supporters.\"\n\nAnd while Trump will have an unfiltered platform to lay out his agenda, any proposals or promises to reach across the aisle could be undone by a tonal pivot in a Tweet or in unscripted remarks.\n\nJust days after last year's call for unity before a joint session of Congress, for example, Trump tweeted \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 that Obama had wiretapped his home in Trump Tower.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Adrienne St. Clair", "body": "Native American leaders are once again pushing for a seat at the decision-making table, saying this week that tribal nations have been overlooked for \"too often and too long.\"\n\nTheir latest concern comes with President Trump's proposed infrastructure plan. The president sent it to Congress on Monday, saying he aimed \"to help build a better future for all Americans.\"\n\nThat same day, President Jefferson Keel of the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) told the annual gathering of tribal leaders that, \"in 2018, no infrastructure bill should pass unless it includes Indian Country's priorities.\"\n\nTrump urged Congress to act quickly on an infrastructure bill that would stimulate the economy, shorten the process to approve building projects and address continuing infrastructure needs in rural areas. The proposed bill would also give more power to state and local authorities and provide training for the younger American workforce.\n\nTrump's proposal reiterates points he outlined in the State of the Union last month, when he described America as \"a nation of builders.\"\n\nKeel used a similar phrase in his State of the Indian Nations address on Monday.\n\n\"Native peoples are also builders and managers of roads and bridges and other essential infrastructure,\" he said.\n\nKeel said that a 2018 infrastructure bill should ensure that all communities \u2014 including native communities \u2014 have the framework needed to succeed. He emphasized that Congress should give tribes the same opportunities that state and local governments have to raise money, invest sufficient funding in basic building needs, remove barriers for tribes to make decisions and support tribal right to consent to developments that affect tribes and tribal lands.\n\n\"We just want to be included\"\n\nIn terms of infrastructure, Trump's latest demands to Congress and Keel's priorities in Indian Country align. Both recognize the need for investing, empowering local authorities and addressing a flawed regulatory system that creates barriers for building. But Keel and others want to make sure that Indian Country is considered part of the bigger picture.\n\n\"If there is going to be any investment in infrastructure, I think we as a country should invest in the areas where it is most needed,\" Russell Begaye, president of the Navajo Nation, wrote in an email to NPR. \"It shouldn't matter if the area is a rural Native American area or not.\"\n\nKeel is on board with the president's proposal.\n\n\"It's not that we disagree with his priorities,\" Keel told NPR on Thursday. \"We just want to be included in any of those plans for development of plans or policies that affect Indian Country in a way that we can not only protect our lands, but we can improve the relationship.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's plan would allocate $200 billion in federal money over 10 years, with additional contributions from states, localities and private investors that it claims would generate $1.5 trillion to fix and upgrade U.S. infrastructure, such as railroads, airports and highways. It would also shorten the project approval process down to two years or less, but Keel and other tribal leaders wonder whether Trump considered native lands when creating his new infrastructure proposal.\n\n\"To be honest, I don't know, but I hope \u2014 and Indian Country is hopeful \u2014 that we will be included in any of those plans or visions for fixing the infrastructure of this country,\" Keel said.\n\nRussell Begaye, president of the Navajo Nation, said that while Trump's plan is a start and the Navajo Nation supports the rural infrastructure program, \"we need to beef it up and apply the funding where it is needed \u2014 and it's needed on tribal reservations like ours.\"\n\nHints to the Trump administration's funding priorities for tribes may be hidden in the 2019 budget released this week, which included significant cuts to federal programs that serve Indian Country. The proposed budget includes a 15 percent cut to the Bureau of Indian Affairs and other major reductions that range from human services programs to law enforcement to education.\n\nHowever, Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke said Tuesday at NCAI's Executive Winter Council, that the president's infrastructure plan does include a complete reorganization of the bureaucratic processes and regulations, including those within native lands.\n\nHe also said he wants to make it easier to build a bridge \u2014 literally. Under the current process, it can take places up to 10 years to get permission to build a bridge, Zinke said. In Indian territory, increased regulations make the approval process take even longer.\n\nZinke, who helped create the new plan, admitted that the government has fallen short when it comes to serving the 573 federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native tribes.\n\n\"I want you to trust the government,\" he said. \"But in many cases, that trust has been breached.\"\n\nSpeaking to the full ballroom of tribal leaders, Zinke called himself a \"champion of all Indian Nations,\" though some of his decisions in his first year to slash the size of National Parks and approve controversial use of federal lands have made him another controversial figure in the Trump cabinet.\n\nWhile Keel said he has great regard for Zinke, he's concerned that the secretary's talk of reorganization could affect relationships tribes have with state and local governments and other tribes, what it will cost, and the fact that there has been no consultation with tribal governments.\n\n\"It's typical in the sense of the federal government saying, 'here's the plan, this is what we're going to do, how do you like it?' And so that's not consultation. Consultation should occur before these plans are rolled out,\" Keel said Thursday. \"By law, we have a right to sit and consult and talk about these things before any decision is made on any reorganization.\"\n\n\"Together,\" \"We\" and, \"American\"\n\nThis isn't a new issue. Indian nations have been pushing for improved acknowledgement of their sovereignty for decades, and Keel reiterated that again in his address on Tuesday.\n\nZinke supported Keel's push to allow tribes to make their own decisions about how their land is used, because \"the view from the Potomac is so much different than the view from Yellowstone, or anywhere else.\"\n\nAnd, from what Trump said in his State of the Union address, he seems to be on board with the entire country working together to improve the country's interior.\n\n\"Together, we can reclaim our building heritage,\" he said. \"We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways across our land. And we will do it with American heart, American hands, and American grit.\"\n\nBut then, it may come down to semantics and how Trump defines \"together,\" \"we,\" and \"American.\"\n\nFor Keel, the definition is clear: \"Tribal infrastructure is American infrastructure.\"\n\nAdrienne St. Clair is an intern on NPR's National Desk.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Scott Horsley", "body": "Tillerson Vs. Pompeo: What Trump's Cabinet Shakeup Might Mean\n\nShortly after announcing a major shakeup on Twitter Tuesday, President Trump told reporters, \"We're getting very close to having the Cabinet and other things that I want.\"\n\nTrump wished outgoing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson well, but said he expects a more simpatico relationship with Mike Pompeo, the current CIA director whom the president has tapped to be the nation's top diplomat.\n\n\"We're always on the same wavelength,\" Trump said of Pompeo, whose confirmation hearing is expected in April. \"We have a very similar thought process.\"\n\nA White House official said Trump was eager to make the switch in advance of upcoming talks with North Korea and ongoing trade negotiations. Here are some areas where the change could make a difference:\n\nTillerson was caught flat-footed last week when Trump abruptly accepted an invitation for face-to-face talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Tillerson, who was traveling in Africa, had told reporters just a day earlier that the U.S. was \"a long ways from negotiations\" with Pyongyang.\n\nTrump acknowledged he hadn't discussed the idea in advance with Tillerson. \"Rex wasn't, as you know, in this country,\" Trump told reporters on Tuesday. \"I made that decision by myself.\"\n\nPompeo defended the president's move but stressed the U.S. and its allies will continue to press North Korea in advance of any Trump-Kim summit.\n\n\"This administration has its eyes wide open and the whole time this conversation takes place, the pressure will continue to mount on North Korea,\" Pompeo told CBS. \"There is no relief in sight until the president gets the objective that he has set forth consistently during his entire time in office.\"\n\nThat objective is denuclearization. According to South Korean officials who met with Kim, the North Korean leader expressed a willingness to discuss it, though it's not clear exactly what that means.\n\nTrump has threatened to tear up the Iran nuclear deal, negotiated by the Obama administration and five other countries, although so far he has stopped short of doing so. The deal gives Iran relief from certain international economic sanctions in exchange for suspension of its outlaw nuclear program. Tillerson and other national security advisers urged the president to move carefully in overturning the deal, arguing that despite Iran's other transgressions, the nuclear agreement is working.\n\nThis was one of the key differences Trump cited in explaining Tillerson's dismissal.\n\n\"We disagreed on things,\" Trump said Tuesday. \"When you look at the Iran deal, I think it's terrible. I guess he thought it was OK. I wanted to either break it or do something, and he felt a little bit differently.\"\n\nPompeo, like the president, has been a fierce critic of the Iran deal, saying it doesn't go far enough in dismantling Tehran's nuclear program and that it's not permanent.\n\n\"President Trump is determined to prevent that from happening in North Korea,\" Pompeo told CBS. Trump's reluctance to live by the terms of the Iran agreement, however, may affect U.S. credibility in negotiations with Pyongyang.\n\nTillerson's ouster comes just days after Trump fired the opening salvo in what critics warn could become a trade war. The former Exxon Mobil CEO was among the advisers who reportedly tried unsuccessfully to stop the president from ordering steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.\n\nPompeo defended the president in an interview with Fox News Sunday, especially with regard to China, which is widely blamed for the glut of steel and aluminum on the world market.\n\n\"It was very clear that what the Chinese are doing, whether that'd be on trade or the theft of intellectual property or their continued advancement in East and South China Seas, this administration is prepared and engaged in pushing back against the Chinese threats so that we can have a good relationship with China in a way the world desperately needs,\" Pompeo said.\n\nTrump told reporters Tuesday that he wished Tillerson well but conceded he and the former secretary of state often didn't see eye to eye. The president regularly undercut Tillerson, once tweeting that he was \"wasting his time\" in pursuing a diplomatic approach to North Korea.\n\nTillerson, in turn, made little effort to hide his disdain for the president. He pointedly did not deny an NBC report last October that he'd once called Trump a \"moron.\"\n\nPompeo, who often delivers the president's intelligence briefing in person, enjoys a better relationship with Trump.\n\n\"For whatever reason, chemistry, whatever it is,\" Trump told reporters. \"Right from the beginning, from day one, I've gotten along well with Mike Pompeo.\"\n\nFormer CIA Director Michael Hayden suggests that Trump and Pompeo share a similar worldview, which has pluses and minuses.\n\n\"I think having a secretary of state who's more compatible with the president, who sounds and thinks more like the president, will actually make some things easier for the administration,\" Hayden told Morning Edition on Tuesday. \"On the other hand, Secretary Tillerson was a counterweight to some of the instantaneous, spontaneous, instinctive decisions that the president was prone to make.

And even if people do have the money, it's hard to actually find enough cash to buy the goods.\n\n\"People don't have bolivares to spend, that's why we have created bills of two denominations,\" Mayor Solfreddy Sol\u00f3rzano told the BBC.\n\nElorza has a festival that starts Monday, according to the broadcaster, and local authorities and businessmen were worried that the cash crunch would cause the city to lose business.\n\n\"Now those who want to buy just a sweet or even a whole cow from the barbecue, will be able to do so,\" cattle breeder Canuto Garcia told the BBC.\n\nThe mayor's office is selling the local currency at an 8 percent commission, according to Reuters, which can be purchased with bolivars using a card or bank transfer. \"People will be able to return the tickets to the mayor's office and claim a bolivar-denominated refund,\" the wire service adds.\n\nThis isn't the first local currency to launch in Venezuela recently. As Venezuela's El Nacional newspaper reports, economist Jose Guerra says that the hyperinflation is causing what he termed \"mini central banks\" to emerge.\n\nLast December, one neighborhood of the capital Caracas started issuing an alternative currency, which it called the panal. As The Associated Press reported, that currency could only be used in a few stores and was meant to help the struggling area buy basic staples such as rice.\n\nAt the time, opposition politician Jose Guerra expressed concern that multiple currencies in the country could further deepen the crisis by creating \"monetary chaos,\" the AP added.\n\nLast month, President Nicolas Maduro also proposed a state-sponsored cryptocurrency to ease the cash crunch.\n\nReporter John Otis told Morning Edition that each unit of the currency would be backed by one barrel of oil. The president has touted the currency as a new innovation, Otis reports, though it has been met with skepticism by some critics who note that the oil that is \"backing\" the currency has not actually been taken out of the ground yet.\n\nOn Monday, the White House imposed new sanctions on Venezuelan cryptocurrency. The executive order prohibits transactions by U.S. citizens using \"any digital currency, digital coin, or digital token,\" issued by Venezuela's government since January.\n\nAs Reuters reports, Maduro's government \"blames the country's crisis on an 'economic war' being waged by Washington and the opposition, aimed at toppling his government.\"\n\nBut critics say strict currency controls are a major factor contributing to the crisis.

The memo didn't even break much news \u2014 comments by members of Congress and reports in the press ended up setting the stage for it nicely.\n\nBut, that doesn't mean it didn't have some points of interest, including these five takeaways.\n\nNPR and other news organizations have not detailed the infamous, unverified dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele because its allegations about President Trump and Russia are unproven. That's why allies of Trump in Congress have sought to make the case that it's the germ of the whole Russia matter.\n\nBy drawing attention to its salaciousness and the prospect that it could be the product of Russian intelligence disinformation, they have sought to argue: If it's the sum total of the case for alleged collusion with the Russians or an alleged conspiracy between the Trump 2016 campaign and agents of the Kremlin, there is no case here.\n\nBut, it's not the sum total of the alleged conspiracy/collusion case.\n\nAnd in fact, the memo prepared by Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, says that what \"triggered\" the FBI's investigation was evidence about onetime Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos. He has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians.\n\nAccording to court documents, Papadopoulos was offered dirt on Hillary Clinton and high-level meetings with Russians early in the campaign. When that story \u2014 after a drunken night out at the pub \u2014 got back to Washington, D.C., the FBI opened its investigation. So it was already underway by the time the Steele dossier materialized.\n\nCarter Page, like George Papadopoulos, was a junior foreign policy adviser to the Trump 2016 campaign. He visited Russia at least twice in 2016 and acknowledged in an earlier interview with the House Intelligence Committee that he'd met with government officials and others there. The core of the memo is that the FBI and the Justice Department used unverified material in the Steele dossier to ask the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to authorize surveillance of Page.\n\nRepublicans say that's the real problem here \u2014 in their telling, biased investigators didn't tell the court the dossier material was unproven political opposition research that had been funded by Democrats. But the memo doesn't say whether there might have been other evidence beyond the dossier \u2014 foreign intelligence intercepts or reporting from human sources \u2014 that also supported the warrant request. (And Friday night the Washington Post reported that the FISA court \"was aware that some of the information underpinning the warrant request was paid for by a political entity, although the application did not specifically name the Democratic National Committee or the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign,\" according to two U.S. officials.)\n\nThe Nunes memo also doesn't say that the FISA court requires that a warrant produce intelligence in order to reauthorize it. So, however the FBI got its initial warrant for Page, the Nunes memo suggests that once surveillance of Page started, it continued producing foreign intelligence.\n\nOfficials from FBI Director James Comey in 2016 to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein \u2014 who was appointed by Trump and serves today in the Trump administration \u2014 have signed successive applications for warrants, the memo says.\n\nThe former British intelligence officer and dossier author Christopher Steele has remained a silent cipher in the middle of the Russia imbroglio. He hasn't been heard from publicly since his document exploded onto the scene.\n\nThe Nunes memo released on Friday, however, makes clear that Steele was not a politically neutral actor.\n\nSteele was commissioned by a Washington private intelligence company, Fusion GPS. It was hired first by conservative underwriters, then Democrats, to conduct opposition research about Trump in 2016. All the same, Fusion GPS' founder, Glenn Simpson, has told Congress that he did not instruct Steele to go dig up dirt on Trump.\n\nRather, in his account, Simpson gave Steele an open-ended assignment to find out what he could from sources in Russia he'd cultivated over his career. Steele, according to Simpson, was shocked by what he learned and volunteered on his own to report it all to the FBI.\n\nFriday's memo complicates that picture. According to the Nunes memo, Steele told a contact at the Justice Department that he was \"desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.\"\n\nThat, for Republicans, is more evidence that anti-Trump bias is at the bottom of the DOJ's Russia investigation. And the memo charges that although the FBI \"recorded\" Steele's feelings, it was \"not reflected in any of the Page FISA applications.\"\n\nUnlike the Nunes memo, however, those underlying documents, remain secret.\n\nSimpson told Congress that one reason Steele broke with the FBI, which the Nunes memo also describes, was he felt the bureau wasn't taking him seriously enough. And Steele was mystified, in Simpson's telling, by a story in The New York Times in which FBI officials said they had no clear link between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nBut that story appeared on Oct. 31, 2016 \u2014 10 days after the FBI and DOJ applied for their warrant on Page, according to the memo declassified and released Friday. The evidence now shows the FBI certainly thought there was a connection, and it has since become clear the bureau had been running a counterintelligence investigation since July 2016.\n\nWas the Times' story a sin of omission by the FBI or one of commission? Did the people who talked with Times reporters Eric Lightblau and Steven Lee Myers not know about the investigative work that was then underway \u2014 or did they mislead the reporters because they wanted to protect their work and not spook potential targets of the investigation in Trump world?\n\nFurther confusing the matter is a Washington Post story from April of 2017. It describes a FISA warrant targeting Page \"last summer,\" based in part on his trip to Moscow and what it calls prior contacts with Russian intelligence operatives.\n\nDoes that mean the Oct. 21, 2016, warrant application referenced in the declassified memo was actually a reauthorization of an earlier one? There is no independent accounting of events at this time to clear up these questions.\n\nFor the House Intelligence Committee's GOP majority, it's not a story about Americans potentially conspiring with a foreign attack on the democratic process. Instead, it's a story about abuse of power, and a hapless martyr in Carter Page.\n\nThe memo saga sucked up all the oxygen in Washington, D.C., this week, but it remains to be seen whether it proves a tactical victory or a strategic one. Republicans' memo targeted the weakest aspect of the collusion storyline within the Russia imbroglio \u2014 a dossier virtually no one defends \u2014 and singled out what they called politically biased FBI and Justice Department officials.\n\nThe collusion case has always been broader than the dossier. Several people in the Trump campaign had contacts with Russians, including Papadopoulos, Page, onetime Trump national security adviser Mike Flynn, now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump Jr., then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and others. Trump Jr., Kushner and Manafort hosted a delegation of Russians at Trump Tower in June 2016 following what was described to Trump Jr. as the Russian government's desire to support Trump's campaign by providing information about Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump's allies have pushed in all their chips on a strategy of tearing down federal law enforcement, within guardrails established by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to preserve the agencies' current leaders in their jobs. Trump has already fired one FBI director, James Comey, and reportedly wanted to fire the Justice Department's special counsel, Robert Mueller.\n\nSo although whatever Mueller's office yields will have been prefigured by months of attacks, including the Nunes memo, nothing in the document directly implicates Mueller or his current team. The question now is how much credibility Mueller, the FBI and DOJ will retain by the next time they act in their investigation.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Domenico Montanaro", "body": "A pedestrian walks past Austin City Hall, an early voting center, on Tuesday in Austin, Texas.\n                \n                \n                    \n                    Drew Anthony Smith/Getty Images\n                    \n                \n                hide caption\n            \n\n        \n\n\n\n            toggle caption\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n        Drew Anthony Smith/Getty Images\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        A pedestrian walks past Austin City Hall, an early voting center, on Tuesday in Austin, Texas.\n\n        \n            \n            Drew Anthony Smith/Getty Images\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n   \n\n   Launching the 2018 election cycle, Texans cast ballots in primaries on Tuesday \u2014 leaving several races headed for runoffs.\n   Election night in Texas offers several takeaways of note, as we look ahead. Here are six to consider:\n   \n   \n\n   1. Texas is still Texas. Turn Texas blue? Not so fast. For all the attention on Democratic turnout \u2014 and turnout was high for Democrats \u2014 they were swamped by voters on the GOP side. Check out the the total vote in the big statewide races, for example. More than 1 million Democrats turned out for the Senate primary that has gotten so much national attention because of the candidacy of Rep. Beto O'Rourke. That was double the Democratic primary turnout in the last midterm. But look at the GOP side: There was 50 percent higher turnout for the uncontested GOP Senate primary featuring incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz. (That was even up slightly from 2014 for Republicans.)\n   Wayne Slater, retired senior political writer for The Dallas Morning News, says he is skeptical of a statewide Democratic wave in Texas, because of the voters who are fueling both parties. The Democratic vote was up in the 15 most populous counties, but the rural vote is still overwhelmingly Republican. Two-thirds of the Democratic vote came from more populous counties, he said, while just 55 percent of the Republican vote did. Tuesday night proved, he said, \"Rural Texas still substantially gives it to Republicans.\" So until that changes, or until Latinos in South Texas truly get fired up for a favored Democratic statewide candidate, \"This whole stuff about a blue wave coming, don't hang your hat on that,\" Slater said.\n   \n            Dems' turnout spike was far from evenly distributed on the map. Biggest jumps relative to '14/'10 came in major metros/wealthy suburbs. That bodes well for Dems in #TX07  #TX32 and maybe #TX23. Less so in statewide races.\n\u2014 Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) March 7, 2018\n\n   \n\n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   2. No sure Bet-o. Cruz got double the votes of O'Rourke, and a largely unknown, underfinanced 32-year-old named Sema Hernandez got nearly a quarter of the vote in the Democratic primary. That doesn't bode well for O'Rourke. Expect Cruz (and his sharp-elbowed operatives) to run a tough campaign, targeting O'Rourke, including that his given name is Robert and Cruz's is Rafael in Latino-heavy Texas and that O'Rourke is too liberal for Texas. In fact, the Cruz campaign is already up with a radio ad with the line, \"If you're gonna run in Texas, you can't be a liberal man ...\"\n   \n   3. The suburbs are still the key to the House \u2014 and Democrats are faring well there. For all that cold water for Democrats statewide in Texas, at the same time there is this silver lining for them \u2014 turnout in the three Republican House districts they hope to flip was on par or outpaced that of Republicans. Yes, those were competitive primaries for Democrats while the GOP is running three incumbents who faced token opposition, but those districts are still in play \u2014 and they're happening in the suburbs, where Trump's approval rating is suffering. Specifically, Democratic turnout surged in major metropolitan areas \u2014 and the wealthy suburbs, as The Cook Political Report's David Wasserman points out.\n   \n    \n\n    \n\n   \n   \n\n   4. The power of female Democratic candidates is real. We've written about the record number of women running for office in 2018. Well, the power of women was felt in the Democratic primaries Tuesday night. Nearly half of the candidates who finished first in Democratic primaries were women (17 of 35). What's more, Texas is more than likely to send two Latinas to Congress. Remarkably, Veronica Escobar, an El Paso County judge running to fill O'Rourke's House seat, and state Sen. Sylvia Garcia, running to replace Democratic Rep. Gene Green in Houston, are the overwhelming favorites to be the first Latinas sent to Congress from Texas. That is really quite something in a state where nearly 4 in 10 people are Latino.\n   \n   \n\n   5. The anti-establishment sentiment is as strong as ever. If anyone thinks either party will be able to put a thumb on the scale for any candidate this year, Texas provided a few flashing red lights. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee published opposition research on congressional candidate Laura Moser, highlighting that she wrote she wouldn't want to live in Paris, Texas, again. It tried to undercut her \u2014 because it believes she would lose in a general election in a winnable seat in the Houston suburbs \u2014 but this, instead, backfired. The gambit raised her profile and helped propel Moser into a May 22 runoff. And a Democratic candidate endorsed by House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer was edged out by a political novice, who is a pastor and former math teacher. (They will face each other in a May 22 runoff, though.)\n   6. Money can't necessarily buy you primary love. There was a time when the candidate with the most money could be seen as the favorite. And when that candidate raised $1 million or more before a primary, he or she was really seen as a favorite. But the energy clearly was not with those candidates Tuesday night in Texas \u2014 on both sides. In four races, those candidates missed even making it to runoffs. A candidate who put in $6 million of her own money in the GOP primary in the 2nd Congressional District finished third and got just 12,000 votes. In the 7th District GOP primary, another who raised $1.1 million finished fourth with just 5,000 votes. On the Democratic side, in the 16th District, a candidate who raised just shy of $1 million finished second \u2014 but with only about 11,000 votes missed the runoff; and a candidate in the 32nd District also raised almost $1 million and finished third with just 5,500 votes. That's $9 million for 33,500 votes, or $269 a vote \u2014 and four losses.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Scott Neuman", "body": "Ex-French President Questioned On Claims He Took Campaign Funds From Gadhafi\n\nFormer French President Nicolas Sarkozy is being detained for questioning as part of an investigation looking into allegations that he took millions of euros from Libya to fund his 2007 election campaign.\n\nPolice took Sarkozy into custody on Tuesday as part of investigation that began in 2013.

Bush appointee, accused Kobach of engaging in \"gamesmanship\" and skirting her orders.\n\nIn the nearly two years since Robinson ordered him to register those voters, she said, he has forced her and the American Civil Liberties Union to monitor his actions down to the tiniest details in an effort to get him to comply.\n\n\"I've had to police this over and over and over again,\" she said.\n\nThe ACLU, representing Kansans suing Kobach, asked Robinson in September, 2016, to hold Kobach in contempt for failing to comply with her May, 2016, order to fully register would-be voters. Their applications lacked birth certificates or other documents Kobach demanded under a 2011 Kansas law.\n\nA series of back-and-forths between Kobach, the ACLU, and the judge since then have turned on what actions were needed to meet the court's order. They centered on requiring Kobach to ensure the registrants would know they could vote, and that county election officers would know to treat them the same as other voters.\n\nThe ACLU argued Tuesday that Kobach didn't follow through. Robinson will consider whether to hold him in contempt while working on a ruling in this month's trial against Kobach.\n\nThat trial wrapped up Monday. Kobach stands accused of violating federal law by refusing to register more than 30,000 legitimate voters who signed up to vote through driver's license offices.\n\n\"It's an election year, your honor, and there's no more time for games,\" ACLU lawyer Dale Ho told Robinson.\n\nKobach, who hopes to be Kansas' next governor, asked the judge not to find him in contempt. The Republican candidate argued he doesn't control the county officials who carry out logistics such as sending postcards to voters to let them know where their polling stations are.\n\n\"We ask them to do things. We plead with them to do things,\" he said. \"If the counties did fail, it was their mistake.\"\n\nThat's one of the things the ACLU said has been a problem: Not all the voters protected by Robinson's 2016 preliminary injunction have been receiving the postcards.\n\nRobinson, at times sounding livid with the secretary, gave him a dressing-down.\n\n\"These people are not second-class registered voters,\" she told him. \"You assured me that they had or they would get the postcards.\"\n\nShe questioned why Kobach had had no problem getting Kansas' 105 counties to require birth certificates and similar documents from voters in recent years, yet denied he could make them mail postcards or comply with other aspects of her orders.\n\nKobach is a key backer of President Donald Trump's claim that Hillary Clinton won the 2016 popular vote because of millions of illegal ballots. He led Trump's now defunct election integrity commission.\n\nHe urged the Kansas legislature to adopt a law that required would-be voters, starting in 2013, to show passports, military papers, birth certificates, or other documents proving they are citizens. That prompted a lawsuit by the League of Women Voters, saying it decimated voter registration drives, and by Kansans who say they were blocked from voting because they lacked such papers.\n\nThe ACLU is representing them. It says Kobach can't enforce his law on voters who register while getting or renewing their driver's licenses because they are protected by the 1993 Motor Voter Act.\n\nThat law created the streamlined process for registering to vote at driver's license offices, where around 40 percent of Kansans put themselves on the voter rolls.\n\nTo win his case, Kobach had to prove a significant number of non-citizens illegally registered to vote and that making people show proof of citizenship is the only way to stop it.\n\nHe denied allegations of voter suppression, and put experts on the stand to present polls and surveys that they say show almost all Kansans have easy access to documents like birth certificates. He also called witnesses to bolster his case that there are thousands \u2014 or even several tens of thousands \u2014 of\n\nnon-citizens already on Kansas' voter rolls.\n\nThe ACLU said the polls and survey conclusions are statistical extrapolations from questionable sources that make fatal math errors and assumptions that academics widely regard as bogus.\n\nThe scolding that Kobach endured Tuesday was just one of many he and his legal team received during the trial over the past few weeks.

Certain materials such as stainless steel must be bought from U.S. suppliers.\n   The reasons are political rather than strategic, he says.\n   \"A lot of that is driven by a pretty simple sentiment, which is when people give their tax dollars to support the national defense, they hope that those taxpayers are being used in a way that also further supports the economy,\" Hunter says.\n   Also given preference are certain countries such as Canada with which the U.S. has reciprocal trading agreements. In some cases, such as aircraft made by the Brazilian company Embraer, the U.S. allows products to be partly manufactured overseas, as long as they are finished domestically.\n   There's another question raised by the president's steel and aluminum tariffs: How necessary are they, really?\n   To impose them, Trump is implementing Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, a rarely used law that gives presidents great leeway to protect industries deemed vital to national defense.\n   \n   \n\n   \"The case in 232 is the argument that for national security reasons we need to maintain a high level of production of some particular commodity,\" says Nicholas Lardy, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n   \"One way of doing that is to put on a tariff, which makes imported goods more expensive and makes it more likely that the domestic firms will be able to continue production,\" he adds.\n   There's no question steel is an essential part of a wide range of weapons and other goods used by the military, from tanks to battleships.\n   But as much as the steel industry has shrunk over the years, the U.S. still produces millions of tons of it each year, Lardy says.\n   \"The steel used by the United States military in tanks and all kinds of other uses is a very, very small portion of total production \u00e2\u20ac\u201d well under 10 percent. The industry is not in decline in terms of output, so arguing that we need to put on tariffs now to preserve a steel industry that is essential to national security I think is a bit of a stretch,\" Lardy says.\n   And in the unlikely event that the U.S. runs out of steel, it has plenty of other places to get it.\n   Much of the steel imported today comes from friendly countries such as Canada, South Korea, Japan and the United Kingdom, with which the U.S. has strong military alliances.\n   The Trump administration has temporarily exempted Canada and Mexico from the tariffs and has suggested it may add other countries.\n   Lardy says the tariffs could invite retaliation by other countries.\n   \"If we're protecting steel, other countries could protect a product they want to protect and say that it's for national security reasons. You're opening the door to this form of protection by other countries,\" he says.", "link": null, "source": "NPR", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Lauren Rosenthal", "body": "The Gun Owners of America \u2013 which has been described as a more extreme version of the NRA \u2013 recruited members for its New York chapter at the Albany Gun Show.\n                \n                \n                    \n                    Lauren Rosenthal/NCPR\n                    \n                \n                hide caption\n            \n        \n\n\n            toggle caption\n    \n\n    \n        \n        Lauren Rosenthal/NCPR\n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n        The Gun Owners of America \u2013 which has been described as a more extreme version of the NRA \u2013 recruited members for its New York chapter at the Albany Gun Show.\n        \n            \n            Lauren Rosenthal/NCPR\n            \n        \n    \n\n   \n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   This week marked the official deadline for more than 370,000 handgun owners in the state of New York to register those guns with state police. New York is trying to use that information to build a comprehensive record of gun owners \u2014 something only one other state has done. The database that California started in 2007 has gotten mixed reviews.   New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, has said he wants to make sure that people who can't legally own guns \u2013 those with criminal convictions, serious mental health issues, or active restraining orders \u2014 aren't somehow falling through the cracks and holding onto their firearms.   Anyone who took out a handgun license in New York before 2013 \u2014 the year the state passed a landmark gun control law \u2014 had to contact state police by Jan. 31 or risk criminal charges. That's caused a real backlash, particularly among rural gun owners, who don't entirely trust their state's intentions.    A commonsense plan?   The Albany Gun Show is a winter fixture in upstate New York. On the show's opening day in mid-January, Tom King, president of the NRA-affiliated New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, posted up beyond all the folding tables stacked with rifles and holsters.    \n    \n\n    \n\n   \n    \n\n    \n\n   \n   \n\n   King said he spent hours and hours answering a question that seemed to be on everyone's mind. \"People are saying, 'Do I have to register or don't I have to register?' So yeah,\" King said. \"There is a lot of confusion.\"   The confusion, he said, is about why the state of New York wants information for its new handgun database. It's actually been on the books since 2013.   In the months after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, several states adopted tougher gun control measures. New York passed a law known as the SAFE Act, which banned most assault weapons. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he wanted to go even further.   \n   \"We'll have for the first time a statewide handgun database that will allow the state, allow local officials to check periodically,\" Cuomo said. The plan lawmakers approved calls for detailed information on hundreds of thousands of legally licensed handgun owners and their weapons \u2013 down to make, model and serial numbers. Some of that information was already available on gun permit applications filed at county clerk's offices across the state, but it was often outdated or incomplete.   State police will build a database they can check against criminal records, alerts filed by mental health professionals, and restraining orders. Only law enforcement can see the information, not the public.    Cuomo described it as a system based on commonsense. \"You don't want criminals and people who are mentally ill to have guns,\" he said. Once the law passed, state police began collecting information from every person who applied for a new handgun permit.    \"You can't make them criminals.\"   The SAFE Act has been popular in urban areas, according to polling data. But some rural gun owners have resisted from the beginning. As the first big handgun registration deadline approached this winter, for people who got their guns prior to 2013, the pushback grew more intense.   Talk radio host Bill Robinson has lashed out at the state on \"The Second Amendment Radio Show,\" which he hosts for a small station near Rochester. \"The government shouldn't have master lists of us gun owners and the specific guns we have,\" Robinson said on a recent episode. \"They don't need it!\"   \n   \n\n   A lot of gun owners are angry. While they can agree that so-called \"bad guys\" shouldn't have access to weapons, some fear that New York is trying to turn them into those bad guys. It goes back to the penalties associated with this registration process. The SAFE Act says failure to register handguns is a felony offense \u2014 and gun permits are automatically revoked.   \"You just can't do that to people that live in your state, that are lawful gun owners,\" Tom King said. \"You can't make them, overnight, criminals.\"   King is most worried about those who had handguns before the 2013 law went into effect, but all handgun owners will have to check back in every five years.   No response from 81,000 gun owners   As of the deadline, more than 81,000 people \u2013 or 20 percent of affected handgun owners in New York \u2013 haven't responded to the state's request. But New York State Police spokesman Beau Duffy argues that concern about this gun database has been overblown. He said felony charges are off the table for now. \"We're not going to take criminal enforcement action, particularly with those people who were unaware of this re-certification process,\" Duffy said.    The next big question is how this registry is going to be used and who's going to follow up with gun owners. Laura Cutilletta, legal director for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, believes it could be a game-changer for police.   \n            \n\n    \n        \n            \n                Ray Kosorek, center, sells a raffle ticket to Shawn Latour, left, at the Gun Owners of America booth inside the Albany Gun Show in January. The Gun Owners of America is a hard-line gun rights group that only recently expanded to New York State. Kosorek says they're hoping to dismantle the state's gun control laws in court.\n                \n                \n                    \n                    Lauren Rosenthal/NCPR\n                    \n                \n                hide caption\n            \n        \n\n\n            toggle caption\n    \n\n    \n        \n        Lauren Rosenthal/NCPR\n        \n    \n\n   \n   \"This kind of tool seems like something law enforcement would really welcome and would make a priority if they can,\" Cutilletta said. \"Because to know who is determined to be dangerous already and has a gun \u2014 I mean, what better information could you give law enforcement than something like that?\"   But Cutilletta doesn't think these systems will start popping up nationwide. They're too expensive, she said. New York set aside $28 million for its database, and California tucked away $24 million.   Instead, Cutilletta said, she and other gun control advocates are pushing for new kinds of restraining orders \u2013 called \"extreme risk protection orders.\" They allow families and police to take their concerns to court and request permission from a judge to take guns away from people who could potentially do harm.     California, Washington and Oregon have already passed legislation allowing these protection orders.

Porter was working as the White House staff secretary on an interim security clearance.\n\nThe ex-wives have said they shared their allegations with the FBI. FBI Director Christopher Wray said that the bureau had completed its investigation into Porter in July. The White House says the subsequent portion of the background check process, conducted by the White House personnel security office, was ongoing at the time of Porter's resignation.\n\nThe allegations against Porter, including a photo of one of the women with a black eye, rocked the White House, which gave varying accounts of who knew what and when.\n\nIn a memo addressed to White House counsel Donald McGahn and others released by the White House on Friday, Kelly said, \"We should \u2014 and in the future, must \u2014 do better.\"\n\nAmong the actions Kelly ordered is for the FBI, which conducts the background investigations for senior personnel, to hand deliver their reports to the counsel \"personally upon completion.\" Furthermore, Kelly said, the FBI official who delivers these files should \"verbally brief the White House Counsel on any information in those files they deem to be significantly derogatory.\"\n\nKelly also said the administration should work with the FBI to \"reduce the time lag between the discovery of significant derogatory information from fieldwork to the disclosure to the White House,\" with a goal of informing senior staff of such information within 48 hours of discovery.\n\nThe new rules would also discontinue any top secret or higher-level interim clearances for individuals whose background investigations have been pending since June 1, 2017, or before.\n\nThat restriction would appear to cut off access to key government secrets, including the president's daily intelligence briefing, to President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, who still does not have permanent security clearance.\n\nKushner's attorney Abbe Lowell said in a statement that Kelly's announcement \"will not affect Mr. Kushner's ability to continue to do the very important work he has been assigned by the President.\" Lowell also said Kushner \"has done more than what is expected of him in this process.\"\n\n\"My inquiries to those involved again have confirmed that there are a dozen or more people at Mr. Kushner's level whose process is delayed, that it is not uncommon for this process to take this long in a new administration, that the current backlogs are being addressed, and no concerns were raised about Mr. Kushner's application,\" Lowell added.\n\nIn his memo, Kelly noted that others, including Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, have said the security clearance process \"is broken\" across the government and needs to be overhauled. Kelly said different agencies have different standards, and \"we need to do better across the board.\" Kelly specifically mentioned allegations of domestic abuse.\n\n\"In the past,\" Kelly wrote, \"credible and substantiated reports of past domestic abuse \u2014 even physical abuse \u2014 were not considered automatic disqualifiers for suitability for employment or a security clearance.

Cheryl Kagan introduced the bill last month and while it initially sought to repeal and replace the song, Kagan said the watered-down version is a \"compromise.\"\n\nIn a tweet, Kagan called it \"a modest effort to address our outdated & offensive State Song,\" adding that it helps \"address our racist past.\"\n\nIn 1861, the year the Civil War broke out, native Marylander James Ryder Randall, angry about Union troops marching through Baltimore, put pen to paper and out poured his frustration. The poem's first stanza gets right to a bellicose and bloody message:\n\nAnd 157 years later, a part toward the end about \"Northern scum\" still seems to rankle. (See the full lyrics below.)\n\nRandall had moved to Georgia and his support of the Confederacy was clear.\n\nBut even though Maryland remained in the Union during the war, it falls south of the Mason Dixon Line. The State Archives describes the somewhat ambiguous position Maryland held, saying it \"was walking a tightrope between the Union and the Confederacy. In addition to being physically between the two sides, Maryland depended equally on the North and the South for its economy. Although Maryland had always leaned toward the south culturally, sympathies in the state were as much pro-Union as they were pro-Confederate.\"\n\nSet to the tune of \"O, Tannenbaum,\" Randall's poem became a song, attaining popularity in Maryland and farther south, but it wasn't until 1939 that it was officially adopted as the state song.\n\nRepublican Sen. Bob Cassilly told NPR in an email that while he disagrees with the Confederate cause Randall extolled, he said the poem also invokes the Revolutionary War. \"I cannot help but be inspired by his poetic references to Maryland's history to justify a call to action and it is wrong to reject his contributions to our culture simply as a matter of ideological purity,\" he said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader J.B. Jennings, a Republican, dismissed the measure as \"a participation trophy bill\" and a \"waste of time,\" reports The Baltimore Sun.\n\nBut lawmakers in neighboring Virginia successfully voted in 1997 to retire their state song originally titled \"Carry Me Back To Old Virginny\" that was seen as a paean to slavery.\n\nIn Maryland, attempts to revise or remove the state song are not novel.\n\nThe Baltimore Sun reported in 2016 that lawmakers had revisited the song at least eight times since it was adopted.\n\nEfforts have gained ground in recent months, following the violence around last summer's white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., and Confederate memorials being removed or shrouded elsewhere across the country.\n\nLast fall, the University of Maryland announced it was suspending performance of the song at athletic events and invited students to submit their own alternate lyrics for a competition to find a new state song.\n\nOn Friday, Sen. Barbara Robinson, a Baltimore Democrat who backed the bill, told the Sun, \"it's not changing history.
