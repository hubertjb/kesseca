McMaster as National Security Adviser. Here is a look at Bolton's background.\n    USA TODAY\n\n\n\nBy electing Trump and tolerating Bolton, America has shown it is not a trustworthy steward of the free world. The damage gets deeper by the day.\nPresident Trump(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\n\nFrom Stormy Daniels to John Bolton, the United States of America will not recover from the presidency of Donald Trump.\nThis is a bold statement, and in a literal sense, it is not true. The United States will exist long after President Trump either steps down after two terms, is defeated for re-election, or is otherwise removed from office.\nBut as a global superpower and the leader of an alliance of free nations, America will not soon \u2014 if ever \u2014 recover the same position of leadership it has occupied since the end of World War II. Bolton\u2019s arrival is a harbinger not of war but of further chaos. He will be in a job no one wanted and for which he was chosen because of his repeated appearances on the president\u2019s only pipeline to reality, Fox News.\nLike much of Washington, Bolton himself seemed taken aback by the news\u00a0\u2014 although this was\u00a0an obvious call the Trump administration has been telegraphing for weeks. Overseas, our allies are maintaining a polite silence, since Bolton will be personal staff to the president. But it is hard to imagine\u00a0they think the accession of a man of almost cartoonishly hawkish views is a good sign for American foreign policy.\nMore: John Bolton will finally let Donald Trump be Donald Trump on foreign policy\nMore: Donald Trump's foolish legal strategy on women is weakening the presidency\nBolton alone cannot destroy American foreign policy. Neither can Trump, who is hardly the first flawed president. Richard Nixon threatened the Constitution and was driven from office. Bill Clinton subjected us to national moral embarrassment. George W. Bush squandered the international goodwill engendered by the tragedy of 9/11 by expanding a just war in Afghanistan into a fiasco in Iraq. Barack Obama, in a single-minded pursuit of a legacy with Iran, removed the United States from vital positions of power in Europe and the Middle East, and outsourced global security to China and Russia.\nAnd yet, all of these were recoverable errors. Clinton was a passable president, a centrist in domestic affairs and a committed leader of the NATO alliance. Bush reassured a terrified nation, and his errors, in hindsight, seem less nefarious than incompetent. Obama is a decent man who did what his voters asked him to do, even when it was wrong.\u00a0\nIn earlier days, we elected a haberdasher and an actor to the Oval Office, and both turned out to be great presidents. A callow playboy from Boston faced down a major nuclear threat from the Soviet Union. Even Nixon\u2019s undeniable accomplishments in foreign affairs gave his eventual downfall a certain tragic grandeur.\nMeanwhile, the rest of the world regarded the United States with a mixture of awe and condescension. We were sneered at by European intellectuals, secretly envied by Communist apparatchiks, and hated by less-developed nations who resented our incredible wealth. But friends and enemies both had to accept that America was a serious nation, run by serious people who always rose to the obligations of global leadership.\nDonald Trump is different. The 45th president\u00a0has shown himself to be utterly unserious about foreign affairs. In just the past few weeks he has lied to the Canadian prime minister (or lied about lying, it is now unclear)\u00a0and suggested, yet again, that America might abandon allies who don\u2019t ante up their protection money. He has impulsively thrown out offers to meet with Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un,\u00a0and sent the market plunging at the prospect of international\u00a0trade wars.\nNow, having rid himself of his meddlesome priest, the too-serious H.R. McMaster, he has brought aboard a man who will insist on speaking his mind at will, much as the president does, and this will only make matters worse.\nMore: North Korea sets a dangerous trap for\u00a0 Donald Trump\nMore: GOP's crazy Russia probe conspiracies are crushed in Fusion GPS transcript\nPOLICING THE USA:\u00a0A\u00a0look at\u00a0race, justice, media\nAll of this reveals a great shift in American politics. By electing Trump and tolerating Bolton, we have shown that we are not a nation that can be consistently trusted with the stewardship of the free world. It\u2019s not that Trump, in the end, will collapse NATO, plunge us into a great depression, or start World War III \u2014 although with Bolton by his side he is capable of doing all of those things \u2014 but rather that the American voters have shown the world that we are capable of astonishing selfishness and petulance. We have abandoned our civic virtue not just at home, but overseas, and once lost, that position cannot be recovered.\nPerhaps this is all too pessimistic. Americans have elected men of weak moral character and shallow political commitment to office before. But not when it mattered so much, and certainly not since the advent of the era in which the President of United States \u2014the sole steward of an arsenal of weapons that can extinguish civilization itself \u2014 became the leader and protector not only of millions of his own citizens, but of the billions of others who rely on America as a friend and ally.\nThe most optimistic outcome is that decades from now the memory of the Trump years fades away, and both we and the world look upon this period as an aberration, a kind of fever or temporary insanity from which we awoke just before we lost any possibility of an American restoration. But the damage is getting deeper by the day. Healing it will take more than just electing a new president: it will require years of painful self-examination, and calling ourselves to account honestly and transparently. Only then will we begin to earn back the presumption of trust and leadership that was once one of our proudest achievements as a free nation.\nTom Nichols is\u00a0a\u00a0professor of national security affairs at the\u00a0Naval War College,\u00a0a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and\u00a0author of\u00a0The Death of Expertise.\u00a0The views expressed here are solely his own.

The airline said it was an effort to remain neutral in the debate over gun policies, after the shooting deaths of 17 people on Feb. 14 at a Florida high school.\nThe airline doesn't disclose how many discount programs it has, airline spokesman Trebor Banstetter said. Delta had sold just 13 tickets under the discount program with the NRA, he said.\nThe NRA and conservatives in the Georgia legislature argued the change represented punishment for people who cherish the 2nd Amendment. Lawmakers threatened to remove a jet-fuel tax break, which had an estimated $40 million benefit for Delta, from a larger tax package unless the carrier reversed course.\n\u201cOur decision was not made for economic gain and our values are not for sale,\u201d Bastian said. \u201cThis decision followed the NRA\u2019s controversial statements after the recent school shootings in Florida. Our discounted travel benefit for NRA members could be seen as Delta implicitly endorsing the NRA. That is not the case.\u201d\n\"Our objective in removing any implied affiliation with the NRA was to remove Delta from this debate,\" Bastian said.\nOn Thursday, the state Senate passed the tax measure 44-10 after removing the jet-fuel provision. The House \u2013 which had passed an earlier version with the jet-fuel provision \u2013 followed with a 135-24 vote.\nGovernors of New York and Virginia, a House lawmaker from Ohio and the mayor of Birmingham, Ala., were among officials who jabbed Georgia in the dispute and offered to have Delta move its headquarters from Atlanta.\nBut Bastian said the airline is staying put.\n\u201cNone of this changes the fact that our home is Atlanta and we are proud and honored to locate our headquarters here. And we are supporters of the 2nd Amendment, just as we embrace the entire Constitution of the United States.\u201d\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2oK4PQw", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/02/delta-reviews-all-fare-discount-programs-after-nra-dispute-costs-georgia-tax-break/388587002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Richard Wolf", "body": "A federal court on Monday rejected Pennsylvania Republicans' effort to rejuvenate their preferred congressional district map for the November elections.(Photo: Jack Gruber, USAT)\n\n\nEfforts by Pennsylvania's Republican leaders to rejuvenate a map of congressional districts that overwhelming favors their party were rejected in court again Monday.\nHaving failed at the state court level to save their own map or block one drawn last month by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court,\u00a0legislative leaders had sought federal court intervention.\nBut while awaiting action by\u00a0the U.S. Supreme Court, the challengers failed to win an endorsement from a three-judge federal district court. The panel concluded unanimously that the GOP leaders lacked standing to bring the case on behalf of the entire legislature.\nThe dispute has national implications because Democrats could win back the U.S. House of Representatives in November. The court-drawn map would give them a better chance of winning several congressional races in Pennsylvania.\nThe three judges \u2014\u00a0all appointed by Republican presidents \u2014\u00a0acted one day before the filing deadline for May's primary elections.\nA ruling from the Supreme Court has been awaited\u00a0 for two weeks.\u00a0In February, the justices refused to block a state Supreme Court decision that declared districts drawn by Republicans unconstitutional because of their partisan tilt.\u00a0\nAfter that ruling, the state court redrew the lines. Republicans then challenged the new maps as improperly drawn and asked that 2018 elections be held under the old lines, beginning with a May primary.\u00a0\nThe Pennsylvania battle is one of many concerning so-called partisan gerrymandering by state legislatures that have raised the political stakes on the eve of the 2018 midterm elections, when Republican control of Congress and many state legislatures is up for grabs.\nMore: Political maps under fire as Supreme Court case on tailor-made districts looms\nMore: Supreme Court to hear second case challenging election districts\nMore: Analysis: Supreme Court debates politics, and Kennedy's silence speaks volumes\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the GOP-drawn map of congressional districts\u00a0\"plainly and palpably violates the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\" The judges demanded new maps within weeks and threatened to design their own if state officials did\u00a0not comply.\nOnce the deadline had passed, the court came up with its own map \u2014\u00a0one that likely would end Republicans' ability to win 13 of the state's 18 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Across the country, every new opportunity for Democrats increases the party's chances of retaking the House in November. That would be a major setback for the Trump administration.\nThe Pennsylvania court's action in January followed by weeks a\u00a0federal judge's ruling striking down North Carolina's similarly\u00a0partisan\u00a0maps. The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked that ruling while it considers complaints from Wisconsin and Maryland that could result in a landmark ruling on partisan gerrymandering this spring.\nThe justices have been considering the Wisconsin challenge to state Assembly districts since hearing oral arguments in early October. They are\u00a0scheduled to hear a challenge to one Maryland congressional district next week. The court's decisions could affect other states as well.\nAlthough Pennsylvania is closely divided between Democrats and Republicans, maps drawn by the GOP in 2011 resulted in the\u00a013-5 Republican edge in the state's congressional delegation. Similarly partisan maps produced a 10-3 GOP advantage in North Carolina, 12-4 in Ohio and 9-5 in Michigan \u2014\u00a0three states that are more closely divided between Democrats and Republicans than those ratios suggest.\nThe Pennsylvania map was possible because Republicans win the GOP districts with an average of 59%, while Democrats win theirs with an average of 77%. In that way, the challengers' lawsuit claimed, the legislature \"packed\" Democratic voters into some districts and \"cracked\" them among the others.\n\u00a0\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2u6bIlc", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/19/republicans-lose-again-fight-over-pennsylvania-u-s-house-map/438940002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Carolyn Mcatee Cerbin", "body": "Carolyn McAtee Cerbin, USA TODAY\n            Published 8:20 p.m. ET March 18, 2018\n        \nPresident Trump looking out a White House window.\u00a0(Photo: The Motley Fool)\n\nPresident Trump asked senior White House staff members to sign confidentiality agreements,\u00a0much like he did as a private citizen, according to a reported column in The Washington Post.\nPost\u00a0columnist Ruth Marcus\u00a0wrote she obtained a draft of the non-disclosure agreement, calling it a \"doozy.\" If found violating the NDA,\u00a0staffers would be penalized $10 million, to be paid to the government.

Bush administration to his recent work as a Fox News commentator, Bolton has backed preemptive military action against Iran and North Korea, and disputed evidence that Russians hacked the Democrats during the 2016 presidential election \u2014\u00a0issues he is apt to deal with as Trump's third national security adviser in less than 15 months.\n\"To stop Iran's Bomb,\u00a0Bomb Iran,\" read a 2015 op-ed by Bolton.\nThe combination of Bolton's hawkishness and Trump's volatility\u00a0could be combustible as they face foreign policy challenges ranging from nuclear weapons standoffs with Iran and North Korea to a potential trade war with China and friction with Russia.\nBolton\u00a0took a low-key approach to his appointment \u2014\u00a0he said he looks forward\u00a0to working with Trump \"in addressing these complex challenges in an effort to make our country safer at home and stronger abroad' \u2014\u00a0while his critics expressed alarm at the future of national security policy.\nBolton's views, especially on Iran and North Korea, \"are overly aggressive at best and downright dangerous at worst,\" said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del.\nTrump backers say Bolton will help bring some much-needed toughness to American foreign policy, an approach they say has yielded results like the prospective meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\u201cI know John Bolton well and believe he is an excellent choice who will do a great job,\" said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.\nBolton, 69, has never been shy about expressing his views, not as a student at Yale, a lawyer, a State Department official during the George W. Bush administration, Bush's ambassador to the United Nations, and, more recently a columnist and Fox News commentator.\nThrough it all, Bolton has been what he calls \"a staunch defender of American interests,\" someone who has \"repeatedly advocated tough measures against the nuclear weapons programs of both Iran and North Korea, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction generally.\"\nCritics worry that Bolton \u2014\u00a0the administration's third national\u00a0 security adviser in less than 15 months \u2014\u00a0will push Trump to take even more aggressive stands toward\u00a0Iran and North Korea, perhaps triggering military conflict that involves nuclear weapons.\nLike the president who picked him, Bolton has been a fierce critic\u00a0of the Iran nuclear agreement, and his appointment could spell the end of that deal.\u00a0Under the agreement, Iran gives up the means to make nuclear weapons as the United States and allies reduces economic sanctions on Tehran.\nIf Trump and Bolton kill off the deal, something they can do starting with a certification deadline in May, analysts said Iran will simply resume a nuclear weapons program. The result could be a de-stabilized Middle East \u2014\u00a0Iranian rival Saudi Arabia has said it may be pursue nuclear weapons of its own if necessary \u2014\u00a0and increased potential for war.\nAs for North Korea, Bolton the media commentator has expressed skepticism about Trump's planned meeting with Kim Jong Un later this year. Bolton has said Trump should demand an immediate commitment from the North Korean leader,\u00a0\u00a0or consider \"something else\" \u2014\u00a0presumably a preemptive military strike at North Korea's military program.\n\"It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current 'necessity'\u00a0posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons by striking first,\" Bolton wrote in The Wall Street Journal in late February.\nHe has expressed similar views about Iran.\nMore: Trump picks John Bolton to replace McMaster as national security adviser\nMore: 5 facts about John Bolton, Trump's new national security adviser\nBolton was, and remains, a proponent of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, a point his critics emphasized in expressing concern about future relations with Iran and North Korea.\nSen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a veteran of the Iraq\u00a0War, said Bolton's record is \"all the proof anyone should need\" that he lacks the judgement to be national security adviser. She noted that Bolton has spoken of preemptive bombing of North Korea and Ian, \"having apparently learned nothing\" from mistakes in Iraq.\n\"His appointment to this critical role could be catastrophic for both our national security and the troops who could be put in danger because of the advice he gives to Donald Trump,\" Duckworth said.\nBolton's \"appointment to this critical role could be catastrophic for both our national security and the troops who could be put in danger because of the advice he gives to Donald Trump,\" said Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat and veteran of the Iraq war.\u00a0(Photo: SHAWN THEW, EPA-EFE)\n\nThere are other challenges on Trump's foreign policy front.\nTrump appointed Bolton just hours after he announced a plan to hit China with tariffs over what he called unfair trade practices. As China threatened retaliatory penalties on U.S. goods, business groups feared the onset of a trade war that would raise consumer prices worldwide. Bolton has also criticized Chinese trade practices.\nBolton also arrives amid Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, including whether the Trump campaign had any role.\nIn his media commentary, Bolton has questioned evidence linking the Russians to email hacks of Democratic Party officials, and said it may have been a \"false flag\" operation.\nOver the past year, analysts have seen soon-to-be-former National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, on occasion, as restraining influences on Trump.\nNow Trump has fired Tillerson and replaced McMaster with Bolton.\nWhile the Bush administration authorized the Iraq war and expressed support for the concept of preemptive military action, Bolton clashed with colleagues he considered too soft.\nAfter serving Bush's first term as\u00a0under secretary of State for arms control and international security, Bush's team moved him to the United Nations after the president picked Condoleezza Rice to be secretary of State.\nTalk show warriorIn recent years, including a stint as a foreign policy senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, Bolton has been a high profile conservative commentator. His books have carried titles like Surrender Is Not an Option: Defending America at the United Nations,\u00a0and How Barack Obama is Endangering our National Sovereignty.\nAmong Bolton's fans: Donald J. Trump.\nDuring a 2015 interview on NBC's Meet the Press \u2014\u00a0 one in which Trump drew scorn from Republican\u00a0 primary rivals for saying he receives military advice because \"I watch the shows'' \u2014\u00a0he singled\u00a0out Bolton as one of his favorite guests.\n\"I like Bolton,\" Trump said then. \"I think he's, you\u00a0know, a tough cookie. He knows what he's talking about.\"\nWhile critics fear Bolton may try to push his ideas on Trump, others said Trump\u00a0may not be so easy to turn, and has been known to make impulsive decisions.\nLiz Mair, a Republican consultant who has been a critic of Trump, said the president has expressed-near isolationist tendencies with his \"America First\" approach that disdains various trade deals and military alliances.\nBolton, meanwhile, has asserted projection of American power throughout the world, almost the opposite of Trump's views.\n\"Bolton probably thinks he can persuade Trump and bring him around to his way of thinking,\" Mair said. \"A lot of people have thought that.\"\n\u00a0\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2FZnfZ0", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/23/new-national-security-adviser-john-bolton-heralds-more-aggressive-trump-foreign-policy/452140002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Gregory Korte", "body": "CLOSE\n\n\n\n\n\n    President Donald Trump said he had \"a very good call\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin to congratulate him on his re-election and discuss a possible meeting.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 21, 2018\n\n\nAs critics accused Trump of looking for an excuse to fire Mueller, former CIA director John Brennan said the president may be fearful of Russian president Vladimir Putin and his government.\n\"One can speculate as to why, that the Russians may have something on him personally that they could always roll out and make his life more difficult,\" Brennan said on MSNBC's Morning Joe.\nBrennan worked for President Barack Obama and has been a fierce critic of Trump.\nHaving once avoided using Mueller's name, Trump has called it frequently in recent days to criticize the Russia investigation. So\u00a0have aides who have been more public about calling on Mueller to bring some kind of conclusion to the process, at least as it relates to the president, claiming it has been a distraction from his duties.\n\"To pretend like going through this absurd process for over a year would not bring frustration seems a little bit ridiculous,\" said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders.\nMore: As Trump attacks Mueller and FBI, critics warn about special counsel dismissal\nMore: Trump again claims 'witch hunt' in Russia probe by special counsel Robert Mueller\nMore: Joseph diGenova, high profile Washington lawyer, joins Trump legal team\nMore: Trump congratulates Putin after Russian president's re-election victory\nTrump'c critics see another motive for the stepped-up criticism: Laying the groundwork for a firing of Mueller, though the White House denies that is in the offing.\nAt the very least, some lawmakers said,\u00a0Trump is seeking to undermine Mueller and his inquiry into possible links between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russians who interfered in the election via email hacks and fake news targeting Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.\nMueller's team is also investigating Trump for possible obstruction of justice, including his 2017 decision to fire then-FBI director James Comey.\n\"We have in unpredictable president who acts often in irrational ways,\" said Sen. Bernie Sanders of New Hampshire, the former Democratic presidential candidate. Speaking on MSNBC, Sanders said that \"we have got to do everything possible to make it clear that if Trump forces Mueller, this is, in fact, an impeachable offense. It is not acceptable.\"\nThe new rhetorical campaign against Mueller comes as his office and Trump's lawyers negotiate possible testimony from the president. The talks center on the scope of the questioning and whether Trump can submit written answers to questions.\nThere is no guarantee Trump will testify at all, as his legal team says it has submitted documentation answering Mueller's inquiries.\nIn addition to Mueller, Trump has criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions, other Justice Department officials, and the FBI over various aspects of the Russia probe.\nDuring Wednesday's tweet session, Trump criticized the Justice Department for not urging the Supreme Court to take up an appeal from the state of Arizona in an immigration case.\nDepartment of Justice should have urged the Supreme Court to at least hear the Drivers License case on illegal immigrants in Arizona. I agree with @LouDobbs. Should have sought review.\n\u2014 Donald J.

Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., a House intelligence committee member who is generally supportive of Trump, urged Trump and his team to give Mueller \"the time, the independence, and the resources\" needed to complete the job.\n\"Let it play out its course,\" Gowdy told Fox News Sunday.\u00a0\nOther GOP lawmakers said they don't expect Trump to make such a move, noting that the special counsel probe has produced indictments and appears on track to gathering facts of Russian involvement in the 2016 election.\n\"They want him to be able to finish the investigation,\" said Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., also speaking on ABC's This Week.\u00a0Former New Jersey Gov.

In a statement, McCabe also said he has been a witness to Trump's 2017 decision to fire Comey as FBI director, an event central to the obstruction of justice investigation.\n\"It is part of this Administration's ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel investigation, which continue to this day,\" McCabe said. \"Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the Special Counsel's work.\"\nWhile Trump hailed McCabe's dismissal as a great day for the FBI, Comey defended his former deputy and sent a warning to the president.\n\"Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,\" Comey tweeted over the weekend. \"And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.\"\nComey's book \u2014\u00a0A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership\u2014\u00a0is scheduled to be published in mid-April.\nDuring his Sunday morning tweet storm, Trump challenged news reports that McCabe has notes taken during the time of\u00a0Comey's firing.

Scott Applewhite, AP)\n\n\n\u00a0\nAs Robert Mueller's investigation gains momentum, President\u00a0Trump's rhetoric against the special counsel grows more threatening.\u00a0Mueller's inquiry\u00a0is \"a total witch hunt with massive conflicts of interest,\" the president complained in a tweet this week.\nAt best, the president is trying to soften up Mueller in the court of public opinion \u2014 and test\u00a0the limits of Republican loyalty. At worst, he is laying the groundwork to act on his brooding instincts and fire Mueller, who was appointed by the Justice Department to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election and any related crimes.\nThat makes it imperative for congressional Republicans who care about the rule of law to establish their own \"red line\"\u00a0\u2014 and to work with Democrats to pass legislation to protect Mueller's inquiry by statute.\nREP. ANDY BIGGS: Mueller should recuse himself or resign\nFiring Mueller wouldn't be as easy as dismissing FBI Director James Comey last year or Secretary of State Rex Tillerson this month. Mueller can be dismissed\u00a0only by the deputy attorney general, who would presumably resign rather than carry out Trump's order.\u00a0But the president could engineer it, nonetheless,\u00a0by terminating enough Justice Department officials until he had his way.\nMost Republicans\u00a0have been shamefully silent about\u00a0this prospect, made more plausible in recent days by Trump castigating Mueller by name for the first time.\nA few\u00a0Republicans have offered tepid support for the special prosecutor. Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah called firing Mueller \"the stupidest thing\" Trump could do. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said it \"would be the beginning of the end of his presidency.\"\nBut can we be sure about that? Would a\u00a0GOP-led Congress that can barely agree on short-term government funding coalesce around the\u00a0monumental and inevitably partisan task of impeachment?\nTrump would have his reasons for firing Mueller, however contrived. By regulation, the special counsel\u00a0can be dismissed\u00a0for, among other things, a \"conflict of interest or other good cause,\" and the president is already drumming up those grounds with his confrontational tweets.\nSuch\u00a0concocted logic might\u00a0be enough for die-hard Trump supporters in the House to sway squeamish colleagues into blocking\u00a0impeachment. Meanwhile, the president would have at least momentarily frustrated an investigation that could threaten his power and his finances.\nMueller's case is, after all, advancing. He already has obtained five guilty pleas, and he has indicted\u00a0former Trump campaign manager\u00a0Paul Manafort, 13 Russians and three Russian entities.\u00a0Trump's recent Twitter outburst\u00a0came just as the White House was reported to have\u00a0gotten a list of questions from Mueller's office that provide\u00a0a hint of the investigation's focus.\nGvien the stakes, it's not enough for GOP lawmakers to speak up in support of Mueller, a highly respected Republican, former FBI director and decorated Marine. They also\u00a0have a duty to\u00a0safeguard\u00a0his inquiry.\u00a0Two bipartisan measures, pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee,\u00a0would protect him. Both provide\u00a0judicial review of any termination's legitimacy. One would challenge the firing before it's carried out, the other afterward.\u00a0\nPass one of them now, by a veto-proof margin,\u00a0before it's too late.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf you can't see this reader\u00a0poll, please refresh your page.\n\u00a0\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2pso55u", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/03/20/congressional-republicans-must-protect-robert-mueller-now-editorials-debates/439009002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Tom Vanden Brook", "body": "Defense Secretary Jim Mattis(Photo: JONATHAN ERNST, AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0A new policy on transgender troops is slated to go into effect Friday after months of consideration and court challenges,\u00a0and it likely\u00a0will restrict their service.\nIn August, President Trump sent Defense Secretary Jim Mattis a memo ordering him to propose changes to the Obama-era policy that allows transgender troops to serve openly and receive medical treatment, including sexual reassignment surgery.\nMattis made his recommendation on transgender service to the White House in February. If Trump does not accept it, the Pentagon will revert to its pre-2016\u00a0practice that effectively banned\u00a0transgender troops from service on medical grounds, according to the memo.\nMattis, since taking charge at the Pentagon, has emphasized the readiness of troops to deploy and fight. In February, the Pentagon established a policy that dismisses troops if they cannot deploy for a period of one year. Presumably, that principle could affect transgender troops who require medical care that could not be provided in a war zone.\nTrump upended the policy on transgender military service in July. He announced, via Twitter, that transgender troops were no longer welcome in the military, and that the government would no longer pay for their surgeries.\nTrump's twitter announcement\u00a0was not coordinated with the Pentagon, and leaders there scrambled to reassure transgender troops that they would not be kicked out and that there medical care would not be interrupted.\nFederal courts have ruled that the Pentagon must allow transgender troops to volunteer for service. Several transgender recruits have signed up since becoming eligible Jan. 1.\nA RAND Corp. study commissioned by the Pentagon in 2016 found that there could be several thousand transgender troops among the\u00a0active-duty force of one million. The report determined that their medical treatment would have a minimal impact on military readiness.\u00a0\nThe current policy for transgender troops was established in 2016 by then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter. It allows transgender service members to serve openly, seek medical attention and allowed for recruits who have been stable in their gender for 18 months to join the military.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2FTUywx", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/22/trump-decide-friday-new-policy-transgender-troops-likely-limiting-their-service/451332002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Dianne Feinstein", "body": "Dianne Feinstein\n            Published 3:15 a.m. ET March 14, 2018\n        \nRepublican talking points on guns are misleading and absurd, especially the argument that Democrats have no constructive ideas to counter this violence.\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.(Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images)\n\n\nWe\u2019ve heard passionate pleas in recent weeks from students who survived a massacre and lost their friends and teachers. Through their pain, with Wednesday\u2019s National School Walkout and in many other ways,\u00a0this generation of students growing\u00a0up with active-shooter drills is demanding that lawmakers take action to reform gun laws.\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s a lot of misleading information about reasonable measures to ensure gun safety, and it distracts from the fundamental issue at hand: the safety of our children, communities, schools and businesses.\u00a0\nMore: In Florida shooting, red flags and blood-stained classrooms\nMore: Don't\u00a0disrespect Sen. Dianne Feinstein. She's 84, female and essential.\nOne frequent refrain:\u00a0\u201cCriminals don't follow the law.\u201d\u00a0This is absurd on its face. By this logic, we shouldn\u2019t criminalize murder, rape or kidnapping. Laws exist to deter crime, and when a crime is committed, laws are there to ensure punishment is meted out.\nBanning assault weapons won\u2019t prevent all shootings, but contrary to Republican talking points, we already know that banning these military-style weapons does reduce mass killings of six people or more.\u00a0When the original ban was in place from 1994 to 2004, the number of such massacres fell by 37% and the number of people dying from them fell by 43%. After the ban expired, the number of gun massacres killing six or more increased by 183% and the number of people dying from them increased by 239%.\nAnother canard: The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. Tell that to the 49 people killed in Orlando at the Pulse nightclub, where an armed guard was on duty and was unable to prevent the murders.\u00a0\nAnother particularly terrible idea floated recently: arming teachers. How can we expect teachers, who already have too much on their plates, to undergo the same training as law enforcement officers and be able to confront killers armed with AR-15s?\nThe falsehood that is most frustrating, however, is that Democrats have no ideas to counter this violence. That couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\nThe first is getting military-style assault weapons such as\u00a0the AR-15 off the streets.\nThese weapons fire much faster than typical hunting rifles. They fire rounds that are also deadlier than those fired from a hunting rifle. A Parkland radiologist noted that an AR-15 round may leave an exit wound \u201cthe size of an orange.\u201d These weapons are designed to kill people, not animals.\nOur current bill would ban\u00a0205 weapons\u00a0by name, and any other weapons that\u00a0accept a detachable magazine and have one military characteristic. The 1994 ban required two additional characteristics, a loophole that gun manufacturers exploited. We'd close that loophole.\nImportantly, the bill also bans high-capacity magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds. The shooter at the\u00a0 grade school\u00a0in Newtown, Conn., for example, used 30-round magazines.\u00a0\nHigh-capacity magazines also lead to deadlier mass shootings. While law enforcement might\u00a0be able to respond to mass shootings in a matter of minutes, a matter of minutes is all it takes to fire hundreds of rounds. In Las Vegas, for example, the shooter fired\u00a01,100 rounds in just 10 minutes \u2014 110 rounds per minute.\nMore: Reporters sound off: Don't ever suggest the news media 'love mass shootings'\nPOLICING THE USA:\u00a0A\u00a0look at\u00a0race, justice, media\nUnder current law, licensed gun dealers cannot sell a handgun to anyone under 21, but they are allowed to sell assault rifles like the AR-15 to anyone over 18. This policy is dangerous and makes absolutely no sense.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile my preference is to ban assault weapons, ensuring teenagers can\u2019t legally buy these weapons is a commonsense step forward.\nAnother problem is a legal loophole permitting accessories such as\u00a0bump stocks, which allow semiautomatic weapons to fire at the same rate as machine guns. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\u00a0Firearms and Explosives has concluded that it cannot regulate or ban these devices without a new law.\u00a0\nWhile President Trump has directed the ATF to review the issue, if the agency were to reverse its analysis after admitting that it lacks the authority, inevitable\u00a0lawsuits would tie up any regulations banning these devices for years.\nToo often, family and friends were aware that a family member posed a threat to themselves or others but were unable to act. The gun lobby and their allies say we need to take guns away from those who exhibit \"red flags,\"\u00a0but it fails to explain that families and law enforcement have little recourse in these situations.\nBarring someone who does not fall into the one of the nine prohibited purchaser categories from buying\u00a0or keeping weapons can\u00a0be done only through a legal process that few states have in place. Our bill would help states establish a court process to allow family members and law enforcement to petition to bar someone from purchasing or possessing weapons.\nLast, none of the above will make a difference unless we improve the background check system by ensuring that states and federal agencies submit required records and ensure that all sales \u2014 not just those at federally licensed dealers \u2014 require a background check.\nI\u2019m hopeful that the groundswell of activism we\u2019ve seen in the wake of the shooting in\u00a0Parkland, Fla.,\u00a0will see results. The American people have always stood on the side of gun safety, and now they\u2019re making it clear that lawmakers who don\u2019t back these commonsense proposals to save lives will face consequences.\nDianne Feinstein is a Democratic senator from California.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\nSarkozy and his former chief of staff have denied wrongdoing in the case, which involves funding for his winning 2007 presidential campaign.\nThough an investigation has been underway since 2013, the case gained traction some three years later when French-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine told the online investigative site, Mediapart, that he delivered suitcases from Libya containing 5 million euros ($6.2 million) in cash to Sarkozy and his former chief of staff Claude Gueant.\nA lawyer for Sarkozy did not immediately respond to a message from the AP seeking comments.\nInvestigators are examining claims that Gadhafi\u2019s regime secretly gave Sarkozy 50 million euros overall for the 2007 campaign. Such a sum would be more than double the legal campaign funding limit at the time of 21 million euros. In addition, the alleged payments would violate French rules against foreign financing and declaring the source of campaign funds.\nIn the Mediapart interview published in November 2016, Takieddine said he was given 5 million euros in Tripoli by Gadhafi\u2019s intelligence chief on trips in late 2006 and 2007 and that he gave the money in suitcases full of cash to Sarkozy and Gueant on three occasions. He said the handovers took place in the Interior Ministry, while Sarkozy was interior minister.\nTakieddine has for years been embroiled in his own problems with French justice, centering mainly on allegations he provided illegal funds to the campaign of conservative politician Edouard Balladur for his 1995 presidential election campaign \u2013 via commissions from the sale of French submarines to Pakistan.\nAccording to Le Monde newspaper, investigators have recently handed to magistrates a report in which they detailed how cash circulated within Sarkozy\u2019s campaign team.\nIn January, a French businessman suspected of playing a role in the financing scheme, Alexandre Djouhri, was arrested in London on a warrant issued by France \u201cfor offenses of fraud and money laundering.\u201d Le Monde said French investigators are also in possession of several documents seized at his home in Switzerland.\nSarkozy had a complex relationship with Gadhafi. Soon after becoming the French president, Sarkozy invited the Libyan leader to France for a state visit and welcomed him with high honors. But Sarkozy then put France in the forefront of NATO-led airstrikes against Gadhafi\u2019s troops that helped rebel fighters topple his regime in 2011.\nIt is not the first time that Sarkozy faces legal troubles. In February 2016, he was handed preliminary charges by French magistrates for suspected illegal overspending on his failed 2012 re-election campaign and ordered to stand trial.\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2u2LKPl", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/03/20/former-french-president-nicolas-sarkozy-police-custody-report/440797002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Oren Dorell", "body": "CLOSE\n\n\n\n\n\n    President Vladimir Putin claims that Russia has tested new nuclear weapons.

But here a few things you might not know about the Russian leader:\nPutin is fabulously wealthy\u00a0According to Russia's\u00a0Central Election Commission,\u00a0Putin earned $860,000 between 2011 and 2016. But estimates of his net worth range from $40 billion to $200 billion. The latter estimate would make Putin, a life-long public servant,\u00a0more than twice as wealthy as Microsoft-founder\u00a0Bill Gates, who holds the title as the world's richest human.\nHow did it happen? As a KGB spy during the Soviet era, Putin maintained ties to organized crime, according to Karen Dawisha, author of\u00a0Putin's Kleptocracy; Who Owns Russia?\u00a0As president, he steers government contracts and the sale of state-owned enterprises to businessmen who support his rule and present him with valuable gifts, Dawisha wrote in 2014.\nThe judo schtick might be just thatPutin has practiced some form of martial arts since he was 14, first with a Russian form called sambo and then switched\u00a0to judo, according to his official biography and interviews. He told NPR in 2001 that he considered the sport a type of philosophy that he has practiced his entire adult life.\nLegal analyst Benjamin Wittes of Lawfare blog says that while there are lots of photos of Putin warming up and throwing opponents, they seem to be willing participants.\n\u201cPutin is fraud martial artist,\u201d Wittes wrote on Facebook. \u201cHe only fights people who are in his power, and they are all taking falls for him.\u201d\nMore: Putin's Russia: These are the candidates in an election some call a charade\nPutin used his martial arts prowess to earn good pay as a movie stuntman in the 1970s, according to a December report in the Russian Dozhd news site. \nPutin\u2019s judo buddies are really, really richSeveral members of Putin\u2019s Yawara-Neva judo club in St. Petersburg became extraordinarily wealthy or powerful since Putin rose to power. They include Putin\u2019s former sparring partner, Arkady Rotenberg, worth $3.1 billion, his brother Boris ($1.2 billion), oil trader Gennady Timchenko ($16.4 billion) and Vasily Shestakov. Shestakov, president of the International Sambo Federation who got his start as a judo trainer, is the only member who does not appear in the Forbes list of Russian billionaires.\nPutin\u2019s dissertation included 'extensive plagiarism'Putin in 1996 earned a post-graduate degree that is a rough equivalent of a\u00a0Ph.D. at the St. Petersburg Mining Institute, though he never attended that school, according to a 2006 presentation by analysts Igor Danchenko and Clifford Gaddy at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, D.C.\nLike this topic?

Putin denied the allegations, which Litvinenko wrote in\u00a0a 2001 book Blowing Up Russia.\u00a0The bombings provided the rationale for a military campaign in Chechnya that\u00a0coincided with Putin's first run for the presidency.\nPutin's war\u00a0in Chechnya employed a scorched-earth policy that left\u00a0thousands of dead Chechens.\u00a0Human rights violations were exposed by Russian reporter Anna Politkovskaya.\nSeveral of his critics and opponents died in brutal waysPolitkovskaya was shot to death at the entrance to her apartment building in Moscow in October 2006.\u00a0Litvinenko was poisoned to death in London with a rare radioactive isotope, polonium-210, the next month.\u00a0At least three other people who investigated or worked to expose their findings about the apartment bombings were murdered.\u00a0And opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot to death in 2015,\u00a0while strolling near the Kremlin with his girlfriend after dinner.\nMore: Mysterious rash of Russian deaths casts suspicion on Vladimir Putin\nTwice married, two daughtersPutin married his first wife,\u00a0flight attendant Lyudmila, in 1983, while he worked for the KGB.

Puskar, AP)\n\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrat Conor Lamb held a narrow lead in the special election for Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District but you wouldn\u2019t know it talking to Republican lawmakers Wednesday. Their message, coming from GOP leadership, was that Lamb ran as such a moderate, he was basically a Republican.\u00a0\n\u201cBoth candidates ran as pro-life, pro-gun and anti-Pelosi,\u201d Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., who previously chaired the House\u2019s political arm, the National Republican Congressional Committee told reporters. He added that the primary process\u00a0 \u2014 which can pull candidates to the extremes in any party\u00a0 \u2014 would make it difficult to replicate candidates such as Lamb.\n\u201cThe reason they call them special elections is because they\u2019re special, and I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it,\u201d he said.\nBut some outspoken Republicans say the potential loss \u2014 in a district Trump won by 20 points in 2016 \u2014 shows\u00a0the party needs to get prepared for high levels of anti-Trump enthusiasm that will put normally safe GOP seats into play.\n\u201cDenial is not just a river in Egypt;\u00a0this is a real problem\u201d said Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, a centrist Republican who will be retiring at the end of his term and has had no problem criticizing his party.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a Republican in a safe seat you better be ready ...\u00a0certainly the members in the marginal swing districts, they\u2019re well-prepared for the fight, they know what they\u2019re in for.\u00a0But I worry about members who have never been in a real fight before.\u201d\nWith all of the\u00a0absentee ballots counted, Lamb held a 627-vote lead out\u00a0of more than 224,000 cast, according to unofficial results.\nAn unknown number of provisional ballots have yet to be counted, and the four counties in the Pittsburgh area district have seven days to finish that task.\n\"If there\u2019s a single Republican candidate in anywhere in the country who thinks that they\u2019re going to be running in a favorable environment they\u2019re sorely mistaken,\" said Josh Holmes, a GOP strategist and former chief of staff to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. But, Holmes added, Republicans could still win. They just have to run strong candidates and campaigns.\u00a0\nWith the outcome of the race still officially in doubt, Lamb claimed victory during the night in a race with implications for November midterm elections.\nLamb, 33, a Marine veteran and former federal prosecutor,\u00a0told an exuberant crowd of supporters that\u00a0voters had directed him to \u201cdo your job\u201d in Washington. \u201cMission accepted,\u201d he declared.\nIn an interview with MSNBC on Wednesday morning, Lamb credited \"just good old-fashioned hard work\" for his claimed victory.\nEarlier, Saccone, 60,\u00a0an Air Force veteran who worked in counterintelligence,\u00a0told his own supporters, \u201cIt\u2019s not over yet. We\u2019re going to fight all the way, all the way to the end.\u00a0We\u2019ll never give up.\u201d\nA source familiar with GOP thinking who was not authorized to talk about Saccone's strategy Wednesday said Republicans were preparing to petition for a recount. Because the race is not statewide, no automatic recount will be triggered even if Lamb's lead is just a fraction of a point.\u00a0\nEven though it hasn't been called, the tight race already has national implications.\nDemocrats have said a win in this district \u2014 or even a narrow loss \u2014 means they can compete anywhere by capitalizing on Trump\u2019s unpopularity and high levels of anti-Trump enthusiasm.\n\u201cThese results should terrify Republicans,\" Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, D-N.M., said. \"There are more than 100 districts more favorable for Democrats than this one, and we look forward to competing hard in every single one.\"\nDemocrats must flip 24 GOP-held seats this fall to seize control of the House, and months ago few had counted on this\u00a0district to be in play. The seat has been in Republican hands for the past 15 years.\nThe Pennsylvania seat was open\u00a0because longtime Republican congressman Tim Murphy, who espoused strong anti-abortion views, resigned last fall amid revelations of an extramarital affair in which he urged his mistress to get an abortion.\nLamb pitched himself as an average guy from the mostly white, working class district. Frequently clad in jeans and beat-up work boots at campaign events, he talked about the economy and jobs, focusing his outreach on veterans and union members.\nHe supported gun rights and opposed abortion though said he would not vote to restrict access, called for new leadership in his own party in Washington and avoided criticizing the president \u2014 whose popularity is 10 points higher in the district than it is nationally, according to Monmouth University polls out this month.\nLamb\u00a0told MSNBC that during the campaign\u00a0he\u00a0kept hearing the same thing:\u00a0\"Work with the other side, do\u00a0what you say you are going to do.\"\n\"They\u00a0don't want us to shut down the government, or posture or bicker, but to figure things out,\" he said.\nDespite\u00a0backing from the president,\u00a0Saccone struggled to raise money and stir the same passions that helped Trump on his way to the White House. The consistent fundraising deficit left him with limited resources to air the message he delivered one on one: His four decades of experience in the private sector, international business and now the legislature should make voters\u2019 choice a no-brainer.\nIn many ways the race for this\u00a0seat is as much about bragging rights\u00a0as\u00a0raw political power\u00a0since the ultimate winner will face re-election in just eight months. In addition, the district, as currently drawn, will disappear next year thanks to a court-ordered redrawing of the state\u2019s district maps.\nThe race, in the end, was also a test of the parties ability to appeal to white, working-class voters.\nMore: Pennsylvania election will be seen as a bellwether for November\nMore: Pennsylvania special election between Rick Saccone and Conor Lamb too close to call\n\u00a0\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2FENXBT", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/14/conor-lamb-holds-razor-thin-lead-over-rick-saccone-closely-watched-pennsylvania-race/423247002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Trevor Hughes", "body": "Russian President and presidential candidate Vladimir Putin exits a polling booth as he prepares to cast his ballot during Russia's presidential election in Moscow on March 18, 2018.(Photo: Yuri Kadobnov, AP)\n\n\nLongtime Russian President Vladimir Putin headed toward easy re-election Sunday as authorities pressured citizens to vote in overwhelming numbers, offering giveaways and prizes\u00a0at the polls.\nCasting his ballot in Moscow, Putin reflected on his expected victory for another six-year term: \"The program that I propose for the country is the right one,\" he said.\nRussian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was barred from running against Putin, said\u00a0he boycotted the election and advised\u00a0other Russians to do the same.\nNavalny was prevented from being a candidate after\u00a0a criminal conviction widely viewed as politically motivated. He urged supporters not to vote because of the absence of any real competition, despite seven other names on the ballot.\nNavalny posted a video on YouTube, saying that \u201con election day, one should usually want to say \u2018I voted,\u2019 but in fact I\u2019m here to say that I didn\u2019t go to vote.\u201d\nGiven the lack of real competition, authorities struggled\u00a0against voter apathy, and pushed\u00a0for a strong voter turnout from Russia\u2019s nearly 111 million voters.\nPutin has been president or prime minister since December 1999, making him the only leader that a generation of Russians have ever known, and the longest-serving leader since former Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.\nPutin's re-election comes amid\u00a0rising tension with the West, particularly with the United Kingdom, which last week accused Russia of using a nerve agent to poison a former spy and his daughter living in England. In addition, U.S. federal prosecutors are investigating whether Russian-linked groups interfered during the 2016 presidential election.\nRussia's\u00a0election monitors reported irregularities at voting stations across country, even though authorities were under orders to ensure that the voting was free and fair after violations marred Putin's last election in 2012. Putin had faced a serious opposition movement then\u00a0but has since boosted his popularity with Russia's\u00a0actions in Ukraine and Syria.\u00a0\nPeople cast their ballots at a polling station in Yelizovo, Russian Far East, Russia, on March. 18, 2018.\u00a0(Photo: Alexander Petrov, AP)\n\nThe English-language Moscow Times newspaper marked the election with a series of stories on young people it\u00a0dubbed \u201cGeneration P,\u201d highlighting some of the 1.3 million people born the year Putin first became president.\nPutin was first named president in late 1999 after the resignation of Boris Yeltsin\u00a0and was elected to two terms. In 2008 he was replaced by Dmitry Medvedev, who named him prime minister, and then Putin was again elected president in 2012.\nMembers of a local election commission prepare a polling station ahead of Russia's presidential election in Simferopol, Crimea.

Voters also faced billboards celebrating Russian greatness \u2014 a major theme of Putin's leadership.\nPutin has traveled across Russia pledging to raise wages, pour more funds into the country's crumbling health care and education and modernize dilapidated infrastructure.\nYevgeny Roizman, the mayor of Russia's fourth-largest city, Yekaterinburg, told rhe Associated Press that local officials and state employees have all received orders \"from higher up\" to make sure the presidential vote turnout is over 60%. \n\"They are using everything: schools, kindergartens, hospitals \u2014 the battle for the turnout is unprecedented,\" said Roizman, one of the rare opposition politicians to hold a significant elected office.\nAuthorities also appealed\u00a0to patriotic feelings by holding the vote on the anniversary of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Polls show that most Russians see the takeover of that Black Sea peninsula as a major achievement despite subsequent Western sanctions.\nTurnout-boosting efforts have been the most visible feature of the campaign. In Moscow, authorities spent $870,000 on balloons and\u00a0decorations at polling stations. In Moscow, first-time voters were given free tickets for pop concerts, and health authorities offered free cancer screenings at selected polling stations. In the southern city of Tambov, the state-sponsored Youth Parliament backed an Instagram competition. Voters who took selfies at polling stations could enter a raffle for high-end electronics, including an iPhone X.\nContributing: The Associated Press\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2GEZkee", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/18/putin-headed-easy-re-election-russias-presidential-race-6-more-years/436129002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kevin Johnson", "body": "Share This Story!Let friends in your social network know what you are reading about'The United States is under attack': Intelligence chief Dan Coats says Putin targeting 2018 electionsThe 'U.S. is under attack,' and Russian President Putin is targeting 2018 elections, the director of national intelligence said Tuesday.Posted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

We're launching a bipartisan project to mend the gaps in our system and make sure our government is competent and trustworthy.George Washington addressing the constitutional convention, 1856 painting by Junius Brutus Stearns(Photo: AP/Virginia Museum of Fine Arts)One year into the Trump presidency, it\u2019s clear that the norms and boundaries traditionally guiding American political behavior have deeply eroded. That matters greatly. A workable democracy can thrive only when there are basic rules, often unwritten, that curb abuse and guide policymakers. Though the two of us are\u00a0from different political parties, we both believe that\u00a0now\u00a0is the time to ensure the president and all our public officials adhere to basic rules of the road. It\u2019s time to turn soft norms into hard law.So far, President Trump has refused to divorce himself from his business interests, despite decades of tradition. He has repeatedly tried to influence federal criminal investigations. Policymaking processes have become haphazard. And we now see worrisome attacks on the independent press. All this shows just how easily a chief executive can ignore the unwritten rules that typically constrain presidents. We see similar erosion elsewhere in government, too. For example, a major tax bill, affecting the whole economy, enacted with no committee hearings.\u00a0More: Short of impeachment, 6 ways Congress can limit Trump damage to AmericaMore: Trump's not being defamed. If he was, he wouldn't need to change the libel laws.Trump is extreme, but he is not the first president to breach core constitutional norms. Our system relies on checks and balances, constitutional commands that are implicit in our founding document but often not spelled out with specificity. Everyone in the political process must act as if limited by invisible guardrails to avoid abuse of power. But at moments of stress or executive impudence, what was assumed to be a solid restriction on improper conduct turns out to be flimsy, relying too much on goodwill or unspoken understandings. When that happens, reform often follows scandal and controversy.\u00a0\u00a0Today, we\u2019re launching an independent democracy task force\u00a0at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's School of Law to holistically review these informal rules, which ones should remain guidelines, and perhaps which ones should be enshrined into law. We\u2019ll examine norms surrounding financial conflicts, political interference with law enforcement, the use of government data and science, the appointment of public officials\u00a0and any other issues that may arise in the coming months. We will be joined by experts and former officials from both parties. The goal is to issue a set of recommendations, policies that can be enacted that mend the gaps in our system and ensure we have a government that functions ably, competently and with the trust of the American people.\u00a0That\u2019s how Americans have responded in other instances when norms have been breached.\u00a0For example, George Washington\u2019s decision to limit himself to two terms seemed like as solid a precedent as ever existed in American political life. Then Franklin D.\u00a0Roosevelt ran for and won a third and then a fourth term, and we amended the Constitution to enshrine the two-term norm. After John F. Kennedy appointed his brother to lead the Justice Department, Congress passed an anti-nepotism law.Richard Nixon\u2019s many abuses, of course, led to a wide array of new laws, ranging from the special prosecutor law (now expired), to the Budget and Impoundment Control Act and the War Powers Act. Some of these were enacted after he left office. But others, such as the federal campaign finance law, were passed while he was still serving, with broad bipartisan support, over his veto.More: Trump's 'stable genius' reality check: America, this isn't a drillPOLICING THE USA:\u00a0A\u00a0look at\u00a0race, justice, mediaSo it\u2019s not too early to begin mapping out needed change. The longer we wait, the more damage our system will sustain. Public confidence in our institutions is plummeting, and with an ever-quickening news cycle that turns on every tweet, we have to take on these challenges in short order.Of course, we undertake this effort in a hyperpolarized and partisan political environment. But we believe, perhaps with more idealism than is merited, that there is a strong underlying consensus in both parties around these norms. There is ample precedent for bipartisan majorities to strengthen institutions in the wake of scandal, controversy or abuse. It\u2019s also why we\u2019re recruiting task force members from inside and outside government, Republicans and Democrats and independents, to join us.Already some leaders \u2014\u00a0at least outside Washington \u2014\u00a0are having these conversations. Legislators in Massachusetts and California have proposed bills that would require the disclosure of tax returns to appear on the state\u2019s presidential election ballots (though California Gov.\u00a0Jerry Brown vetoed one of those attempts). While we may not agree with their proposed solutions, the fact that states \u2014\u00a0our laboratories for democracy \u2014\u00a0are beginning to generate their own debates about norms gives us hope that there\u2019s room to have these discussions on a national level.It\u2019s not enough to read news stories \u2014\u00a0or tweets \u2014\u00a0and fret. Our system is facing a challenge it has not faced in decades. These norms of liberal democracy are being pummeled around the world, as well. At a moment like this, perhaps it is a good thing to break the norm of partisanship.\u00a0Preet Bharara, a scholar in residence at the NYU School of Law, was U.

He criticized Trump's moves to isolate the U.S. from other global powers. And he decried the revolving door of staffers who\u00a0have sullied the reputation of the White House on their way out the door.\"The character of the guy and the (turnover) and fighting, and just the constant chaos around his presidency that is self-inflicted has made it hard for him,\" Bush said. \"I want the president to succeed. I don't think think he will succeed if he continues on this path.\"Bush blamed both political parties when sizing up the ongoing battle\u00a0over immigration. The White House on Thursday released a plan that provides a path to U.S. citizenship for up to 1.8 million undocumented DREAMers in exchange for $25 billion to help build a border wall and a nearly 25% reduction in legal immigration.The proposal was immediately panned by Democrats opposed to reducing legal immigration so drastically and many Republicans opposed to granting citizenship.The two sides have until Feb. 8 to strike a compromise, and Bush said both are placing possible political gains\u00a0above the real-life consequences facing the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants.\u00a0\"The left and the right have figured out that this is a great political wedge issue,\" Bush said. \"It's not a moral issue or an economic issue. It's purely an issue of, 'How do we poll this to make sure our\u00a0team, our tribe, does better?'\"Bush  Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., for not taking a leading role to help both sides find a\u00a0middle ground. Rubio, another failed presidential candidate in 2016, was\u00a0part of a bipartisan group of senators\u00a0that pushed\u00a0an immigration overhaul\u00a0through the Senate in 2013, but he has been largely silent during the current debate.\"God forbid you actually took on something that was controversial and paid a political price,\" Bush said. \"That's the attitude in D.C. right now. Certainly Sen. Rubio is no different in that regard. Marco is a talented guy and he understands this issue really well, and maybe behind the scenes he's working hard. But at some point, his leadership would be really helpful.\"The former governor had high praise for one member of the Trump administration: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. He admitted\u00a0that he's biased since she used to be a board member on his education foundation. But Bush said she's struck the right balance between supporting school choice principles and keeping the Washington bureaucracy out of classrooms.\u00a0\"She a phenomenal advocate,\" he said.As for his own political future, Bush was\u00a0non-committal.\u00a0He said the political environment in Washington has become so toxic that he has no interest in jumping back into another presidential race. \"Until that changes, I don't anticipate running for anything,\" he said.Bush, 64, said he'd rather continue focusing on his work, his education foundation, candidates that he supports, and his golf game.\"I got a blessed life,\" Bush said. \"I got four grandkids.

Chicago officials argued in September that penalizing cities \u2013 withholding funds to support local public safety efforts for shielding undocumented immigrants was unlawful and unconstitutional.\"The harm to the city's relationship with the immigrant community if it should accede to the conditions is irreparable,\" U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber said then in a 41-page decision, siding with the city of\u00a0Chicago.Justice officials, however, believe that cities' receipt of the grant funds is contingent on their compliance with federal law that promotes such information sharing on immigration matters. The department says\u00a0that local police are required to inform federal authorities before undocumented immigrants are released from custody and allow federal access to local jails.The latest Trump administration actions identifies 23 of those governments, including the states of California, Oregon and Illinois. They claim that local policies do not encourage cooperation with federal immigration authorities.\u00a0For the local and state governments, the stakes are high. Chicago, for example, received more than $2 million in grants last year, which it used to buy police department vehicles and support non-profit groups working in high-crime neighborhoods.The communities have argued that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility and that the U.S. Constitution prohibits Washington from forcing them to assist.More: 'Victory for the American people': S.F. attorney lauds blocking of Trump sanctuary cities orderMore: Trump's crackdown on 'sanctuary cities' blocked nationwideMore: Legal victory for 'sanctuary cities' only the beginning of long immigration battleRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2rACmB8", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/24/justice-department-threatens-sanctuary-cities-subpoenas-escalating-trumps-immigration-enforcement-ca/1061225001/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jason Harrow", "body": "Jason Harrow, Opinion contributor\n            Published 5:00 a.m. ET March 8, 2018\n        \nThere's no legal justification for states\u2019 use of winner-take-all. It\u2019s an unconstitutional way to pick the electors who cast votes for president.\nA polling station in Appleton, Wisc., on Nov. 8, 2016.(Photo: Dan Powers, USA TODAY Network)\n\n\nIn the Electoral College, winner-take-all is the name of the game in nearly every state. It's\u00a0why swing states are so critical: Winning a state by just a few thousand votes can lead to a huge haul of electoral votes, but losing by just a few means going away empty-handed. So winner-take-all leads to millions of votes being tossed out, and to a question few have considered until recently: Is the winner-take-all allocation of Electoral College votes even legal?\nUp to now, most people have thought of winner-take-all as\u00a0just the weird, quirky way we elect presidents in our country. America\u2019s done it this way for centuries, they think. This is the system required by the Constitution, they might even think. So of course it\u2019s legal, they conclude.\nMore: How states can fix the Electoral College and prevent future Trumps\nMore: Let's fix the Electoral College. It'll be easy compared to gerrymandering\nBut longstanding practice or tradition doesn\u2019t by itself make something legal. The Supreme Court famously reaffirmed this in its recent decision that states could not continue to define marriage as between one man and one woman just because that\u2019s the way it had always been defined.\nMoreover, the winner-take-all system is not required by the Constitution. Instead, the Constitution leaves the choice of allocation of presidential electors up to each state, but that choice is subject to the \u201cone person, one vote\u201d requirement of the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.\nMy organization, Equal Citizens, is working with a bipartisan team of lawyers that filed legal challenges to the winner-take-all system last month in four states \u2014 California, Massachusetts, Texas and South Carolina. Equal Citizens also ran a crowd-funding campaign to support the project and developed the legal theories underlying the lawsuits.\nThe challenge for winner-take-all\u2019s defenders\u00a0is\u00a0serious. If we take away the \u201cwe\u2019ve always done it that way\u201d argument (doesn\u2019t matter legally), the \u201cit\u2019s in the Constitution\u201d argument (winner-take-all\u2019s not in there) and the \u201cstates can choose presidential electors however they want\u201d argument (they can\u2019t, because they need to comply with \u201cone person, one vote\u201d), then the foundation for our current system starts to look less stable. In fact, our system crumbles.\nIt turns out there is no argument that can legally justify states\u2019 use of winner-take-all to allocate electors. It\u2019s an unconstitutional way to pick the presidential electors who ultimately cast votes for president and vice\u00a0president.\nThat conclusion may seem stunning, but it\u2019s actually a straightforward application of a principle of fairness and equality of citizenship that has been in our Constitution since the Equal Protection Clause was added following the Civil War.\nTo see why, it\u2019s important to remember that voters don\u2019t actually cast votes for president but instead vote for slates of presidential electors expected to support that candidate with a vote in the Electoral College. For example, in 2016, California was entitled to choose 55 presidential electors, and, because Hillary Clinton got more votes than any other candidate in the state, California used winner-take-all to select 55 Democratic presidential electors who would all cast votes for Clinton for president.\nDonald Trump managed to get over 4.5 million votes in California,\u00a0more than in any state he won except for Texas and Florida,\u00a0but they were tossed out. Trump\u2019s 4.5 million popular votes translated into zero presidential electors.\nMore: We're so divided we're helping our enemies. Independents like us can fix this.\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at\u00a0race, justice, media\nThis violates the Constitution\u2019s principle that all votes matter equally. Imagine if California got rid of its 40 state Senate districts and instead asked voters to simply vote for a Democratic or Republican majority leader. And then imagine that instead of allocating the 40 senators to match the two parties'\u00a0share of the\u00a0vote, the state gave the winning party all 40\u00a0state Senate seats. So the Senate would always be 40-0 in favor of one party.\nThis winner-take-all scheme for electing state senators would be illegal, because it violates one person, one vote. A state can\u2019t turn a contested election for multiple seats into a 40-0 blowout. This principle applies in selecting presidential electors as much as it does for state senators.\nSome might dismiss the analogy by saying that the winner-take-all state Senate scenario is a ridiculous hypothetical. After all, no state has anything like it, and it seems absurd. But that\u2019s exactly the point: Using a winner-take-all system to choose the members of a multi-member body is so plainly unfair and unconstitutional that no state would dream of implementing it for most of its state offices. And yet 48 states currently have just such a system for selecting presidential electors. It must be put to an end.\nJason Harrow is chief counsel for Equal Citizens, a non-profit working to end states\u2019 use of winner-take-all in the Electoral College.\n\u00a0\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2oWIJtW", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/03/08/winner-take-all-presidential-system-unconstitutional-court-challenge-jason-harrow-column/398742002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Ledyard King", "body": "CLOSE\n\n\n\n\n\n    Hurricane Maria was the strongest when it made landfall in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico.

Prison officials have repeatedly contended that all\u00a0employees are regarded as \"correctional workers first.\" Indeed, all staffers are provided basic officer training as a condition of employment, but few civilians have been required to put that training into practice before they are tapped to plug security gaps.\"We continue to hire\u00a0staff at institutions around the country as needed to further the mission of the Bureau of Prisons,\" the agency said in a statement.Nearly two years ago, USA TODAY reported that nurses, physical therapists and other medical staffers had been pressed into security duties, raising concerns about their safety. The report was followed by a memo from then-acting Director Thomas Kane urging restraint in authorizing such deployments, directing wardens to use it \"only as a last resort.\"Yet the practice has only continued \u2013 and even accelerated \u2013 at some short-staffed institutions.The Federal Correctional Institution, Tallahassee a low security federal correctional institution with a detention center.\u00a0(Photo: Bop.gov)Two months after Kane's June 2016\u00a0memo,\u00a0the warden overseeing federal prison operations in Hazelton, W.Va., said officer shortages there required civilian employees to pull officer shifts in inmate cell blocks and as substitutes for officers on vehicle patrols.\u00a0\"Current staffing levels at...Hazelton have made it difficult to fill mandatory posts on a regular basis without relying on augmentation,\" Warden Joe Coakley said in the\u00a0Aug. 1, 2016 memo.There also are growing concerns that the level of risk\u00a0to both staffers and inmates will only increase, as the Trump administration is in the midst of\u00a0cutting about 6,000 positions from its force \u2013 about a 14% reduction system-wide. The cuts include about 1,800 officer positions.While the BOP said the majority of the positions being eliminated are currently vacant, the moves \u2013 including plans to transfer an undisclosed number of inmates to private contract prisons \u2013 has roiled the ranks where some work schedules vary from day to day.A sampling of prison work rosters at the Coleman, Fla., complex obtained by\u00a0USA TODAY showed that up to 36 civilian staffers were assigned to guard duty on any given day last year. Their numbers included teachers, laundry workers, financial managers and a \"religious service\" staffer.At the federal prison complex in Victorville, Calif., John Kostelnik, chief of the local prison workers union, said up to 60 civilian staffers a day have been assigned to officer posts.\"We have people who have literally never done this before,\" he said. \"It's quite scary.

But neither of those things are necessary to cause major economic damage, social unrest and threats to public health and safety.\u00a0In reality, taking out a dozen large power plants in key locations across the country could hamstring our electric grid for days, weeks or even longer depending on the damage done. \u00a0\nAnd that is something the U.S. public rightly fears. In\u00a0a survey this month sponsored by Protect Our Power, a group of professionals\u00a0focused on strengthening the grid, 66%\u00a0of respondents said they are unprepared for an extended power outage, and 67% said they would anticipate significant financial or quality-of-life damage in the event of an extended outage.\nMore: Will new Facebook scandal finally force tech CEOs to testify to Congress?\nMore: Election hacking is going to happen. Here's what we can do to protect our votes.\nLast week\u2019s warning from the federal agencies was not surprising. It followed similar recent warnings, including a confidential report last June about a narrower set of activities aimed at the U.S. nuclear, energy and manufacturing sectors, although none has been as specific as the March 15 alert.\nThe most frightening issue is that the prior warnings do not appear to be creating a sense of urgency in Congress, at the federal agencies that exercise regulatory control over the electricity supply, or among the utility companies that\u00a0own and operate the electric grid.\u00a0To be fair, activity is taking place, but at a pace that does not appear to match the escalating threat we face right now. \u00a0\nThe Homeland Security department said months ago that the campaign is ongoing and hackers are actively pursuing the long-term objective of being able to access and manipulate computer networks inside the electric industry.\u00a0It now appears that they have achieved at least partial success, and done so relatively quickly. \u00a0\nThis raises two key questions: What is next from the hackers? And what do we need to do to stop them?\nA relatively simple but highly effective way to damage industries and handicap the U.S. economy would be to manipulate or control our power grid \u2014\u00a0the vast, highly inter-connected network of power plants, wires, poles and transformers that deliver electricity to homes, businesses and critical service providers every day.\u00a0Puerto Rico stands as a painful illustration of the damage and chaos inflicted by being without power for an extended period of time.\nMore: GOP's crazy Russia probe conspiracies are crushed in Fusion GPS transcript\nPOLICING THE USA:\u00a0A look at\u00a0race, justice, media\nThe complexity of how the grid is operated and regulated presents real challenges when trying to take significant steps forward in cyber security.\u00a0But it is clear from polling that the American public understands the need for coordination across agencies and entities, and expects the government to be a leader in getting the relevant parties on the same page and urgently taking concrete steps to secure the grid \u2014\u00a0now. \u00a0\nAbsent cohesive, focused leadership and funding, scatter-shot grid upgrades will likely only achieve limited success.\u00a0On the upside, advanced technology is making grid improvements easier than ever before.\u00a0What we now need to establish is a large-scale public-private partnership that brings together the necessary expertise and financing to support making the grid more impenetrable as quickly as possible.\nInvesting in the grid pays extra dividends by ensuring resilience in other key infrastructure areas being targeted by cyber-attacks \u2014\u00a0the nuclear, water, aviation\u00a0and manufacturing sectors \u2014\u00a0all of which require a reliable supply of electricity to perform their critical functions in society.\nBeginning today, with foreign entities effectively sitting in our power supply control rooms, it must become a national imperative to: Identify exactly where grid improvements and upgrades are needed;\u00a0develop a collective national plan to drive key short- and long-term grid improvements; implement whatever regulatory reform are necessary to ensure that our bulk power system can repel the threats we face; and, identify the public and private funding mechanisms, including the potential use of tax-exempt government bonds, to fund these critical improvements and protect our national security and welfare.\nWe should not keep kicking this can down the road. The enemy has crossed the threshold. The time for federal regulators and Congress to act is now, before it is too late. \u00a0\nSuedeen Kelly, a former member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, provides regulatory counsel to Protect Our Power, a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to strengthen the reliability and resilience of the U.S. electric grid.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2FWniF2", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/03/22/russians-hack-electric-grid-escalating-threat-wheres-battle-plan-column/446478002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "David Jackson", "body": "President Trump(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)WASHINGTON \u2013 President Trump is open to the idea of improving federal background checks on gun purchasers who may be mentally unstable in the wake of last week's mass killing at a Florida high school,\u00a0his spokeswoman said Monday.\u201cWhile discussions are ongoing and revisions are being considered, the president is supportive of efforts to improve the federal background check system,\" said White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.The statement came less than a week after a student was charged with killing 17 people and injuring more than a dozen others\u00a0at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\u00a0Sanders confirmed that Trump spoke on Friday with Sen.

For now, I hope Democrats win Congress in 2018.Republicans once believed in limited government, fiscal restraint, support for the defense and national security establishments, family values, and a strong American role in maintaining global order. More than that, we were the party that believed in logic and prudence over emotion. Our hearts were perhaps too cold, but never bleeding.Today\u2019s Republicans, however, are a party of bellowing drama queens whose elected representatives blow up spending caps, bust the deficit, and attack America\u2019s law enforcement and national security agencies as dangerous conspirators. Their leader expects banana republic parades, coddles the Kremlin, protects violent men in positions of responsibility, and overlooks child molestation. The rank-and-file GOP members who once claimed that liberals were creating a tyrannical monarchy in the Oval Office now applaud the expansion of the presidency into a gigantic cult of personality.So, am I still a Republican?More: Team Trump men's club: Accused of mistreating women? You're hired.More: Let Trump military parade pass us byI get asked this question a lot since coming out as a Never Trump Republican during\u00a0the 2016 campaign. When it comes from Democrats, it\u2019s almost always a question asked in bad faith, as they want me either to quit my party or to answer for all of its current (and past) sins. When asked \u201chow could you stay in your party\u201d by people whose party has plenty to answer for itself,\u00a0including the nomination of Hillary Clinton,\u00a0it\u2019s not a productive conversation.However, Republicans themselves (and not just the Never Trump variety)\u00a0are having the same conversations, privately and publicly. Is President Trump now the avatar of the Republican Party, and if he is, how can anyone who once believed in the party of Lincoln and Reagan stay in it?For a time, I actually dropped my GOP voter registration after the disgusting spectacle of the 2012 primaries, where Newt Gingrich was taken seriously as a possible president while extremists in a debate audience shocked even Ron Paul by yelling \"Yeah!\"\u00a0when he was asked about an uninsured young man in a coma\u00a0and whether \"society should just let him die.\u201dIt didn\u2019t feel right. I am a conservative who joined the GOP in 1978; I had worked for a Republican in the Senate; I was still voting for Mitt Romney; I wanted the GOP to make gains in Congress in 2014. I may have been disgusted by the behavior of some Republican voters, but I was still attached to the Republican Party. I was, in a strange way, an Independent In Name Only.As the likelihood of a Trump victory grew, I felt even more strongly attached to the Republicans because I wanted to prevent my party from being hijacked by a callous and vulgar life-long Democrat for whom party politics were just an extension of his own strange emotional needs, and who cared nothing for conservative ideas or values.When Trump won, I stayed, because I believed that his victory was an aberration, a bizarre outcome that resulted from several factors, including Clinton\u2019s impossibly inept campaign. There would come a day when Trump was gone, and reasonable conservatives would have to pick up the pieces and recreate the GOP as a functioning center-right party rather than as a vehicle for an ongoing series of inane populist keggers.But for now, I really am a Republican In Name Only, because I actively want to see the Republicans defeated \u2014 soundly \u2014 in 2018 (and in 2020, if the president is not primaried out of his seat). Where I was once unaffiliated but quietly cheering on conservatives, I am now a member of a party I want to see cast into the political wilderness for a few years \u2014 or longer, if that\u2019s what it takes to break the fever.In terms of party loyalty, that makes me a pretty lousy Republican. On the other hand, I might argue that I am in fact a better Republican than the opportunists on the White House staff and Capitol Hill who have left the party but refuse to give up the name.The same could be said for \u201cRepublican\u201d voters. Do they really represent the party, or are they The Coalition of the Incoherent? Like the president himself, they have no political compass, no policy preferences, and no attachment to anything that cannot be expressed in a bumper sticker. Indeed, what seems to unite Trump voters is a generic hostility to immigrants and a demand that government resources and transfers not be shrunk but redirected \u2014 to themselves.Many of them, of course, actually voted for Back\u00a0Obama. (If these Obama-to-Trump voters are \u201cRepublicans,\u201d then the term has no meaning at all.) I have argued that these voters are better understood not as \u201cRepublicans,\u201d but more generally as \u201cwhite welfare-statists\u201d whose party affiliation is up for bids every four years.I\u2019m also taking a gamble based on history. Populism looks powerful from the outside, but it rarely succeeds in holding power. It is not a belief\u00a0but a reflex, one that fades away once the hard work of governing looms. It\u2019s a great vessel for expressing anger. It\u2019s not very good at keeping the lights on and delivering the mail.With all of that said, what could finally drive me from the party? If going to the wall for deficits, wife-beaters, mall creepers\u00a0and Vladimir Putin isn\u2019t enough, what is? And how much longer can this go on before the Trump administration damages the words \u201cRepublican\u201d and \u201cconservative\u201d permanently?My answer is to see whether\u00a0enough of my fellow conservatives agree with me in 2018 to accept that the party needs to be purged of the New Know-Nothings. Perhaps Republicans like me need a new name: I am not a \u201cNever Trumper\u201d so much as I am a \u201cRepublican in exile,\u201d as I wait for an end to the occupation of the party by people who never cared about its history or beliefs.More: Are Trump voters ruining America for all of us?: Tom NicholsPOLICING THE USA:\u00a0A\u00a0look at race, justice, mediaOf course, no one should underestimate the ability of the Democrats to screw up an election, and it\u2019s possible that the midterms and the 2020 election will end up breaking for Trump\u2019s GOP. If that happens, the Republican Party has no future. I and many others, including younger people, will leave, and the GOP will become largely a regional party, confined to islands of older white voters in the South, the Rust Belt\u00a0and the mountain states who will be gone in 30 years and who will take the GOP with them.At that point, some other party \u2014 not a \u201cthird way\u201d but a new conservative party \u2014 will have to take the GOP\u2019s place. That process will take decades, and I will not live to see it. And so I\u2019d prefer to revive the GOP after it is forced back into the minority, when we can have a real fight within the party about what it stands for and who it should support by reforming the Republican National Committee, the primary process\u00a0and the platform.The GOP needs to be returned to its foundations in conservative ideas instead of left to drift in mindless rage and willful ignorance. It does not need to be abandoned, nor does it need to be burned to the ground. But it definitely needs to be temporarily evacuated and fumigated.And so, for the near future, the GOP losing is the only way to win. I\u2019ll stay for now, because I believe in a loyal opposition \u2014 even if it has to be within my own party.Tom Nichols, a\u00a0professor of national security affairs at the Naval War College,\u00a0is the author of\u00a0The Death of Expertise.

Rand Paul blocked the bill from passing before a midnight deadline, forcing a partial government shutdown.The\u00a0deal \u2014\u00a0negotiated by congressional leaders and released late Wednesday night \u2014hit a glitch when Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., demanded\u00a0a vote on restoring the strict 2011 budget caps that limited congressional spending.Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to allow the vote and Paul would not back down.Paul's right to object will elapse at 1 a.m., and the Senate will proceed to vote on the measure, which includes short-term federal funding through March 23. But federal funding from the last short term spending bill expires at midnight.If the Senate approves it, the 652-page budget bill\u00a0would then go to the House, where it faces stiff\u00a0opposition from liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans.\u00a0That budget agreement would eliminate the budget caps \u2014 set in 2011 to reduce the federal deficit \u2014 paving the way for Congress to increase defense spending by $165 billion and hike domestic spending by $131 billion over the next two years.The measure is stuffed with other fiscal\u00a0provisions, including a\u00a0major disaster relief package for regions hard-hit by last year\u2019s devastating storms and a one-year\u00a0suspension of\u00a0the debt limit,\u00a0the amount the U.S. Treasury can borrow to pay the nation's bills.\u00a0President Trump offered a full-throated endorsement of the deal in a Wednesday evening tweet,\u00a0saying \"Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill.\"McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer of New York have both championed the agreement as a bipartisan breakthrough that would end the destabilizing cycle of short-term spending bills that lawmakers have had to pass repeatedly\u00a0to keep the\u00a0lights on at\u00a0government agencies.\u00a0\u00a0\"No one would suggest it's perfect, but we worked hard to find common ground and stay focused on serving the American people,\u201d McConnell said Wednesday.\u00a0With backing from the two Senate leaders, the bill is expected to win bipartisan support in that chamber.

William \"Mac\"\u00a0Thornberry, R-Tx.,\u00a0chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday.\u00a0But conservatives called it a budget-busting proposal that would further sink the country in a sea of red ink. \u00a0\"It's a plus-up on everything,\" said Rep.

And on Friday, the association urged its members to lobby against legislation in Maryland because it \"lacks basic due process protections and is ripe for abuse.\"\n\"The NRA fought red flag laws for years,\u201d said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety. \u201cIf they\u2019re serious about supporting them now, they\u2019ll signal as much to their lobbyists in the 22 states where red flag bills are currently pending.\"\nSen.

Among them:\n\u2014\u00a0Criminal penalties for those who bring \u201cfalse or frivolous\u201d charges.\n\u2014\u00a0A determination by a judge, by \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d that the person poses a significant risk of danger.\n\u2014\u00a0A requirement that a judge determine whether the person meets the standard for involuntary commitment.\n\u2014\u00a0If the order is granted, the individual should receive community-based mental health treatment.\n\u201cTo be effective and constitutional, they should have strong due process protections and require that the person get treatment,\u201d Cox says in the video.\nRead more: Some officials wanted Florida school shooting suspect forcibly committed in 2016\nHouse passes school safety bill as students protest inaction on gun violence\nBaker, the NRA spokeswoman, couldn\u2019t point to a federal or state bill that the organization supports, but she said, \u201cWe\u2019re confident that there will be a bill introduced that provides adequate due process while ensuring that people who are a danger to themselves or others don\u2019t have access to firearms.\u201d\nThe NRA statements\u00a0coincide\u00a0with student protests across the country against congressional inaction on gun violence. Last Wednesday, thousands of students staged \u201cNational Walkout Day\u201d events, marking the one-month anniversary of the shooting deaths of 17 students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The accused gunman, Nikolas Cruz, was long-known to law enforcement as troubled.\n\u201cMy observation here is that the man did everything but take an ad out in the paper, \u2018I'm going to kill somebody,\u2019\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said at a Wednesday Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.\nAfter the shooting, Florida became the sixth state to pass a red flag law. (The NRA sued the state of Florida to block part of the law but didn't take a position on the red flag provision.) Several other states introduced versions of \u201cred flag\u201d bills in response to the shooting.\nPresident Trump, as part of his response to the shooting, called on all states to adopt extreme risk protection orders and directed the Department of Justice to provide technical assistance to states that want to implement the orders.\nIn Congress, other bills are pending and some are forthcoming.\nA House bill would give states incentives to allow family members or law enforcement to get court orders to temporarily stop dangerous individuals from purchasing or possessing a gun. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., sponsored the Senate version of the bill\u00a0\u2013 and took Cox\u2019s statement as a sign of support.\n\u201cNow there can be no excuse from Republicans to oppose our legislation,\u201d she said in a statement.\nHowever, Baker said Feinstein\u2019s bill doesn\u2019t offer \u201cmeaningful due process,\u201d uses a low evidentiary standard and doesn\u2019t require the individual seek treatment.\nGraham and Sen.

That's ludicrous.\" Licensed dealers at gun shows are required to conduct background checks, but private sellers are not.\nAs President Trump sends mixed signals about what he'll support when it comes to gun legislation, his approval rating has fallen to its lowest level in the USA TODAY survey since he was inaugurated last year. Just 38% now approve of the job he's doing as president; 60% disapprove.\nThat's a steep drop from the president's standing one year ago, in March 2017, soon after his first address to Congress had received good reviews. Then, 47% expressed approval, a high-water mark for him in the poll; 44% expressed disapproval.\nWhat's more, the intensity of feeling is hardening against the president. Now, the percentage who \"strongly disapprove\" of him is more than double the percentage who \"strongly approve,\" 39% compared with 16%.\nA new CNN poll released Sunday put Trump's approval rating at 35%, his\u00a0lowest level in that survey.\nThe USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll of 1,000 registered voters nationwide, taken Tuesday through Saturday, has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.\nOn guns, a nation that is often divided on issues is remarkably united:\u00a0\nBy almost 2-1, 61%-33%, they say tightening gun-control laws and backgrounds checks would prevent more mass shootings in the United States.By more than 2-1, 63%-29%, they say semi-automatic weapons like the AR-15, used by the Florida shooter, should be banned.By more than 6-1, 76%-12%, they say people who have been treated for mental illness should be banned from owning a firearm.Even gun owners are inclined to support those three measures. But a majority of Republicans say tighter gun laws wouldn't prevent more mass shootings, and they oppose banning semi-automatic weapons.\u00a0\nRepublicans are more likely than Democrats to support a ban on firearms for those who have been treated for mental illness, a proposal also backed overwhelmingly by Democrats and independents.\u00a0\n\"Everyone who commits a mass shooting has a mental issue,\" says John Shaw, 60, of Madison, Wisconsin. \"Preventing them from getting the gun is the most important thing.\"\nDespite the consensus on some measures, few expect Congress to toughen gun-control laws in the foreseeable future. Fewer than one in five, 19%, say the odds are excellent or good. More than three in four; 76%, rate them as fair or poor.\nRepublicans are more likely than Democrats to predict Congress will act, 28% compared with 14%.\nMore: Florida school shooting: Broward sheriff probes claim that more deputies did not immediately enter school\nNRA hits back at United Airlines, Delta, other companies for cutting ties\nArmed with an AR-15, military veteran keeps watch on Indiana high school\nThere is a partisan divide on whether restricting access to guns or improving mental health care would do more to curb mass shootings. By a wide margin, Republicans and gun owners say improving mental health care would do more. Democrats and those who don't have guns in their household are inclined to say restricting access to guns would do more.\u00a0\nOverall, 39% say improving mental health care would do more; 31% say restricting access to guns would; 25% say both.\u00a0\nThere is bipartisan agreement on strengthening security at schools. By 58%-32%, those surveyed say schools should be required to have an armed police officer on site. By 62%-27%, they say schools should be required to have metal detectors at their doors.\nInterestingly, younger adults were less likely than older ones to back those ideas, although a majority in both groups supported them.

And the timing for a final vote in that chamber remained unclear.If the Senate approves the measure, the 652-page budget bill\u00a0would then go to the House, where it faces stiff\u00a0opposition from liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans.\u00a0That budget agreement would eliminate strict budget caps\u00a0set in 2011 to reduce the federal deficit \u2014 paving the way for Congress to increase defense spending by $165 billion and hike domestic spending by $131 billion over the next two years.The measure is stuffed with other fiscal\u00a0provisions, including a\u00a0major disaster relief package for regions hard-hit by last year\u2019s devastating storms and a one-year\u00a0suspension of\u00a0the debt limit,\u00a0the amount the U.S. Treasury can borrow to pay the nation's bills.\u00a0President Trump offered a full-throated endorsement of the deal in a Wednesday evening tweet,\u00a0saying \"Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill.\"Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky\u00a0and Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer of New York have both championed the agreement as a bipartisan breakthrough that would end the destabilizing cycle of short-term spending bills that lawmakers have had to pass repeatedly\u00a0to keep the\u00a0lights on at\u00a0government agencies.\u00a0\u00a0\"No one would suggest it's perfect, but we worked hard to find common ground and stay focused on serving the American people,\u201d McConnell said Wednesday.\u00a0With backing from the two Senate leaders, the bill is expected to win bipartisan support in that chamber. But its fate in the House remains unclear, with both Democrats and Republicans facing internal party divisions over the deal.\u00a0Defense hawks and moderate Republicans said it's a strong compromise that will provide a much-needed boost to the military.\"If you vote no,\u00a0you\u2019re voting against fixing the military,\" Rep. William \"Mac\"\u00a0Thornberry, R-Tx.,\u00a0chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday.\u00a0But conservatives called it a budget-busting proposal that would further sink the country in a sea of red ink. \u00a0\"It's a plus-up on everything,\" said Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., a member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus. \"It's a Christmas tree on steroids.\"\u00a0Democrats are also conflicted because while the deal would\u00a0increase\u00a0spending for their favored domestic programs, the agreement does\u00a0nothing to protect the DREAMers, the undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.House Democratic leader Nancy\u00a0Pelosi delivered a record-breaking 8-hour speech on the House floor Wednesday, telling the stories of DREAMers\u00a0without\u00a0a break\u00a0to\u00a0object to the budget plan's failure to protect those immigrants.\u00a0If conservative Republicans in the House oppose the agreement, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.,\u00a0will need a significant number of Democratic votes to get it passed. It's not clear how many\u00a0House Democrats will follow Pelosi's lead and oppose it.Lawmakers face an imminent\u00a0deadline. Current federal funding runs out at midnight on Thursday, and if Congress does not pass a new spending bill, it will trigger a partial government shutdown.\u00a0The House on Tuesday passed its fifth stop-gap spending bill, a proposal that would fund domestic programs through March 23 and also\u00a0give the Pentagon a full-year budget of $659 billion. Democrats strongly oppose that measure because they say it short shrifts domestic spending.The Senate is expected\u00a0to\u00a0vote on and reject that House-passed bill Thursday,\u00a0then move to replace that short-term bill with the broader budget agreement.If it passes, it would give Congress six weeks to craft a spending bill for\u00a0the rest of 2018 that meets the new budget targets before the government\u00a0runs out of money again.Contributing: Michael Collins and Nicole GaudianoRead\u00a0more:\u00a0Senate leaders unveil sweeping budget deal; House may still reject itNancy Pelosi told DREAMer stories for more than 8 hours on the House floor\u00a0\u00a0Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2nM1EIo", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/08/senate-poised-approve-massive-two-year-budget-deal-setting-up-fight-house/318278002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "William Cummings", "body": "CLOSE\n\n\n\n\n\n    Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was fired on Twitter by President Trump after a 14-month tenure.\n    USA TODAY\n\n\n\nEach week, USA TODAY's OnPolitics blog takes a look at how media from the left and the right reacted to a political news story, giving liberals and conservatives a peek into the other's media bubble.\nThis week commentators from the left and the right reacted to the news that President Trump unceremoniously fired his secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, via Twitter.

Feeling ignored, put-upon, and mistreated, state secessionists want to take their fate into their own hands.\u00a0\nAt present, there\u2019s little prospect of adding stars to the American flag, but these movements do indicate a widespread sense of dissatisfaction among (mostly rural) populations who feel that they are governed by people in distant urban centers who know little, and care less, about their way of life. Their complaints, in many ways, sound like the complaints of Americans circa 1775.\nIntrastate secession isn't exactly new in the United States: West Virginia was once part of Virginia, for example, and Tennessee was once part of North Carolina, though that evolution was less fraught. But in recent years we've seen a number of states facing calls to split, from inhabitants of regions who feel effectively unrepresented.\nMore: Florida shooting yet another government failure to keep us safe: Glenn Reynolds\nMore: Hollywood, ESPN and other debacles: Why can't our ruling class do its job?\nIn New York State, for example, there have been repeated calls to split\u00a0upstate New York from the New York City region. One such proposal involves letting the NYC area keep the name \"New York,\" while the new upstate state would be named \"New Amsterdam.\" The reason? \"We're completely overwhelmed ... by the policies of New York City,\" according to New York State Senator Joseph\u00a0Robach.\u00a0The idea has been circulating for over 25 years, but now seems to be gaining some degree of additional support.\nPerhaps better-publicized is Silicon Valley entrepreneur Tim Draper\u2019s plan\u00a0to split California into six states, one of which would be, essentially, Silicon Valley\u2019s own preserve.\u00a0Though Draper\u2019s plan did not make the 2016 ballot, it served as a useful outlet for complaints about unrepresented parts of the state.\nSome such effort might also please the residents of inland and northern California, who feel that California state government \u2014\u00a0with its heavy interests in the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas \u2014\u00a0views them with indifference or even hostility. Writing in the\u00a0Los Angeles Daily News,\u00a0demographer Joel Kotkin compared these neglected, poverty-stricken regions of California to apartheid-era South Africa\u2019s \u201cbantustans,\u201d\u00a0observing that inland California has high unemployment, poor healthcare, and a general sense of being despised and neglected by the coastal high-rollers running the state.\nSomewhat less ambitious than Draper\u2019s is a plan to split the wealthy, coastal regions of California from the remainder, leaving the state of \u201cNew California\u201d to be made up of most of the state\u2019s rural areas. As CBS News reports,\u00a0\u201cunlike other separation movements in the past, the state of New California wants to do things by the book, citing Article 4, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution and working with the state legislature to get it done, similar to the way West Virginia was formed. ...\u00a0The group is organized with committees and a council of county representatives, but say it will take 10 to 18 months before they are ready to fully engage with the state legislature.\u201d\u00a0The goal is to let the rural areas govern themselves in ways more suited to their needs, while the wealthy coastal regions do the same. (The New California movement already has chapters in 34\u00a0counties, according to its website.)\nA similar dynamic obtains in Washington State,\u00a0where some legislators are reviving a proposal, dating back to 1915, to separate Eastern Washington into its own state, provisionally named \u201cLiberty,\u201d and in Oregon, where activists in the eastern part of the state want to secede\u00a0from coastal Oregon, either to set up their own state, or to join the existing state of Idaho,\u00a0with which they feel they have more in common. (There\u2019s also a plan to join Eastern Washington and Eastern Oregon into a new state called \"Cascadia.\")\nMore: We're so divided we're helping our enemies. Independents like us can fix this.\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at\u00a0race, justice, media\nThere\u2019s even talk about splitting downstate Illinois\u00a0away from Chicagoland. Once again, the downstate hinterland contains a lot of people (but, despite their much greater geographic extent, fewer than the Chicago metro area) who feel unrepresented, and believe that Chicago\u2019s dominance of the state causes downstate tax dollars to flow toward politicians\u2019 vote-buying efforts in Chicago, while Chicago voters impose regulations that downstate citizens don\u2019t want.\nSplitting a state is hard. West Virginia managed because the existing Virginia legislature was in rebellion against the United States, making it easy\u00a0for President Lincoln and the Congress to recognize the new rump legislature put together in Wheeling as the \u201cofficial\u201d legislature of Virginia, and accepting its approval (which the Constitution requires) for forming a new state out of part of the old Virginia. Such circumstances aren\u2019t likely\u00a0today, let us hope, though if states like Illinois or California went bankrupt, they might agree to a split in exchange for a federal bailout.\nBut short of that, is there anything Congress can do? I think so. As I argue in a recent paper,\u00a0most of the state-secessionist complaints have to do with urban areas applying the heavy hand of government regulation to rural people with different needs: Overstrict environmental laws, labor laws, firearms laws\u00a0and the like. \u00a0\nFederal law governs all of these areas, but generally allows states to regulate more strictly if they so desire. I suggest that federal law be changed to pre-empt state laws in the same area, making federal regulation not just a floor, but a ceiling by preventing states from adopting stricter rules.\u00a0(In some cases, this could even be done by administrative regulation). \u00a0\u00a0\nSome might argue that such a move infringes on states\u2019 rights, but the federal government has traditionally stepped in to protect local minorities from being oppressed by local majorities. That\u2019s what the Civil Rights Act did, for example. Using federal power to promote greater freedom seems in keeping with our traditions and values.\nPerhaps Congress will get on this. Or perhaps the state of \u201cNew California\u201d will one day be a reality.\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of\u00a0The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

Burr said the panel will work with the Senate Appropriations Committee to secure more funding for states.\nAt a minimum, senators said, any new machine that states buy should have a voter-verified paper trail and no WiFi capability that can be hacked.\n\"Russians cannot hack a piece of paper the way they can a computer system connected to the Internet,\" said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.\nStates must be in the leadThe senators emphasized that states \"should remain firmly in the lead on running elections, and the federal government should ensure they receive the necessary resources and information.\" States have bristled at any suggestion that the federal government infringe on their traditional role in running elections.\nThe committee also said there is a need for improved information-sharing about cyber attacks among the federal government, states and local governments. Senators said the U.S. intelligence agencies should work to declassify information quickly, whenever possible, so they can warn state and local officials about attacks.\nThe Department of Homeland Security should work closely with election experts to\u00a0create voluntary cybersecurity guidelines and a public awareness campaign to promote election security awareness, working through the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, the National Association of Secretaries of State, and the National Association of State Election Directors, the committee recommended.\nSenators said homeland security officials must also work to reduce the amount of time that states have to wait for help with cybersecurity.\nThe election security recommendations are the first action taken by the committee as part of its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. The panel, which began its probe in January 2017, plans to come out with further reports in the weeks ahead.\n\"We're now at a point where we've wrapped up one piece of our investigation\u00a0which deals with election security,\" Burr said.\nSenators on the committee wanted to issue their election security recommendations this month, which kicks off the congressional primary election season. Texas\u00a0held its primary earlier this month, and Illinois was holding its election Tuesday.\nCongress has so far done little\u00a0in response to\u00a0last year's reports from the Department of Homeland Security that Russian hackers tried to breach election systems in\u00a021 states in 2016.\u00a0Although no actual votes were changed, hackers\u00a0broke into Illinois' voter registration database.\nDemocrats\u00a0\u2014 and some Republicans\u00a0\u2014 have been pushing to boost funding for FBI counterterrorism teams and grants to states\u00a0to protect against Russian meddling in this year's elections.\nThe Senate committee's bipartisanship stands in stark contrast to the House Intelligence Committee, which has been plagued by bitter partisan division during its year-long Russia investigation.\nRepublicans on the House committee called an end last week to their year-long investigation of Russian meddling, concluding that there was \"no evidence of collusion, coordination, or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians.\" The probe was ended over the objections of Democrats, who charged that key documents and testimony still have not been obtained.\nHouse vote set for ThursdayThe House panel is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to make the Republican report public, after it is reviewed by intelligence agencies to ensure that no classified information is released. Democrats are continuing their own investigation and plan to write a separate report.\nThe congressional actions come amid increased criticism by President Trump about special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, which is being done on behalf of the Department of Justice. Mueller is probing Russian interference in the 2016 election, possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, and possible obstruction of justice by the president. Trump has lashed out directly at Mueller's prosecution team in recent days, prompting concerns that the president may try to fire the special counsel.\nSen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and other prominent Republicans \u2014 along with Democrats \u2014 have warned Trump against taking any action against Mueller, saying it would prompt a constitutional crisis. White House attorney Ty Cobb has said the president is not considering firing Mueller.\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2GM069j", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/20/election-security-senate-panel-says-congress-must-boost-funding-protect-voting-systems/441436002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Bart Jansen", "body": "This photo posted on the Instagram account of Nikolas Cruz shows a weapon being held.

House Republicans are running for the exits instead.On Wednesday, Rep. Trey Gowdy\u2014chairman of the powerful House Oversight Committee\u2014became the third GOP lawmaker in just the last week to announce plans to leave Congress at the end of this term.All told, 41 Republican House members have said they will either retire or seek another office, compared to 16 Democrats, according to the House Press Gallery. Some of those lawmakers have been forced out amid sexual harassment allegations, while others are running for governor or the Senate.But at least nine are influential committee chairmen who, like Gowdy, are leaving with no scandal afoot. So what\u2019s pushing these gavel-wielding lawmakers out the House door?A toxic stew of congressional dysfunction, perilous electoral prospects, term limits on committee chairmen, and an increasingly rightward tilting party with a president widely see as erratic\u00a0at its helm.\u201cWashington\u2019s not a very pleasant place for anybody,\u201d said former Rep. Tom Davis, a Virginia Republican who retired in 2008 after 14 years in the House. \u201cThe polarization and all the gamesmanship\u201d can be grinding, Davis said, and the rewards aren\u2019t very sweet these days. \u00a0\u201cThe public hates you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t get re-elected, but you\u2019re not getting great outcomes.\u201dJust look at Congress\u2019 legislative plate right now: a spending standoff that threatens a second government shutdown in a matter of weeks, an explosive immigration debate with no clear solution, and a presidential infrastructure proposal that appears dead on arrival. \u00a0Another helping, anyone?\u201cThere is a time to come and a time to go,\u201d Gowdy tweeted on Wednesday. The former federal prosecutor from South Carolina said he wanted to leave politics and return to the justice system.\u201cWhatever skills I may have are better utilized in a courtroom than in Congress, and I enjoy our justice system more than our political system,\u201d he said in a statement.Gowdy\u2019s announcement came on the heels of two others:\u00a0Rep. Pat\u00a0Meehan said he would not run for re-election last week after news emerged that a former aide had accused him of sexual harassment. And on Monday, New Jersey Republican\u00a0Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen announced that he would also retire rather than seek another term\u00a0in November.\u00a0Frelinghuysen last year became chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, once considered the most powerful perch in Congress.Read more:House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy to retireReports: Rep. Patrick Meehan denies sexually harassing staffer he called a 'soul mate'GOP retirements boost Democrats' hopes for taking the House in 2018But with earmarks banned -- making it nearly impossible to bring home pet projects or use the promise of them as leverage in negotiations -- and spending bills mired in the legislative mud, the committee has lost some of its luster. And Frelinghuysen\u2019s decision was at least in part a nod to the electoral landscape.Democrats are hoping to ride a wave of anti-Trump anger\u00a0to regain the House majority in November. Frelinghuysen would have faced a tough re-election in his swing New Jersey district, where several Democrats were already lining up to challenge him.The party that controls the White House generally loses seats in the midterm elections, and several nonpartisan political analysts believe that President Trump\u2019s dismal approval ratings will be a significant added drag on Republican congressional candidates.David Wasserman, a political analyst with the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said a wave election may already be forming, giving lawmakers a heads up to get out of the way.\u201cIn past cycles when the House has changed parities, members haven\u2019t seen it coming until a couple months out,\u201d Wasserman said. \u201cThe difference is now Republicans have a choice between filing for re-election or retiring or running for other office. And many of them are deciding that it\u2019s not worth trying to ride this out.\u201dEven those in safe House seats aren\u2019t sure they want to stay in office if it means being in the minority, Wasserman said. In the House, the minority has almost no power to influence legislation or set the agenda.Davis agreed and said some Republicans have become \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with the party, as it has shifted rightward and now is led by Trump.\u201cThis is not the party that they grew up with,\u201d Davis\u00a0said. \u201cThe Republican base had kind of rotated from the country club to the country.\u201d\u00a0Jesse Hunt, a spokesman for the House Republican campaign committee, rejected the suggestion that Republicans were leaving because their party was about to be out of power.\u201cThe vast majority of retirements are term-limited chairmen who hail from deeply Republican districts,\u201d Hunt said.In the House, Republicans operate under rules that limit committee chairman to six years no matter how long they serve in Congress. Wasserman and others agree that dynamic is playing a role in driving even powerful and safely ensconced lawmakers out.\u201cMany members spend years in Congress climbing up the ranks to become a committee chair but if you\u2019re termed out after a couple cycles, you can suddenly find yourself with less power,\u201d said Wasserman. \u201cUpward mobility is essential to many members.\u201dDavis said that rule was imposed in the 1990s because committee chairman had become too powerful.

Leon Panetta, who served in top jobs in the Clinton and Obama administrations, said on CNN that the world was \"breathing a sigh of relief\" at the idea of talks. Veteran diplomat Chris Hill, the chief U.S. negotiator in the last set of serious negotiations with Pyongyang, on MSNBC called the announcement \"extraordinary.\"\nAnd Kim, a global outlaw, finally has won what he has long sought \u2014\u00a0the prestige of a face-to-face meeting with the American president, and without making the most consequential concessions that previous administrations had\u00a0demanded.\nThe episode is\u00a0classic Trump, reflecting both his willingness to disrupt the accepted wisdom on how to proceed\u00a0and his confidence in his own ability to strike a deal where others have failed. It also reflects his comfort with chaos, delivering a bombshell on foreign policy at a time he also is scrambling party orthodoxy on economic policy and, by the way, facing a legal probe on Russian election meddling that seems to be accelerating toward a conclusion.\nAt least for the moment, the diplomatic jolt about Pyongyang overshadowed\u00a0concerns about whether Trump had started a trade war when he imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports Thursday, not to mention the potential legal complications of $130,000 in hush money his lawyer paid a porn star with the stage name of Stormy Daniels.\nFor a president who delights in bombshells, it may have been the biggest bombshell of them all.\u00a0\nMore: Trump agrees to first-ever meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un\nMore: North Korea: What could possibly go wrong when Trump meets Kim Jong Un?\nMore: North Korea-U.S. talks: Why make the offer now, what does North Korea want in return?\nWhen President Barack Obama met with President-elect Trump after his unexpected election in 2016, the outgoing president told the incoming one that North Korea would be the most urgent problem\u00a0he would face, and the threat from Pyongyang's nuclear program has only grown since then. Now North Korea has fired intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the U.S. mainland and tested what analysts believe was a hydrogen bomb.\nEfforts to rein in the nuclear program have failed, despite efforts by a series of presidents. During the Clinton administration, in 1994, North Korea signed an agreement to freeze its plutonium weapons program in exchange for aid, but then secretly pursued a uranium enrichment program anyway. During the George W. Bush administration, in 2005, Pyongyang promised to dismantle its nuclear program, another promise it didn't keep.\nDuring his tenure, Trump has used more threatening rhetoric than any of his predecessors, vowing \"fire and fury\" against a North Korea threat. Now he also is the first to agree to sit down with the North Korean leader. In exchange, Kim promised to stop nuclear and missile testing for now and to countenance the joint military drills in South Korea next month.\u00a0\u00a0\nSome analysts expressed concern about whether the Trump administration was ready for the talks that are now slated to follow this spring\u00a0without the meticulous preparations that marked previous rounds of negotiations, and without an experienced diplomatic team in place. The administration's top Korea expert resigned recently, and there is no U.S. ambassador in South Korea and no confirmed assistant secretary of State for Asia.\u00a0\nTrump, for one, doesn't seem concerned about that. \"I won't rule out direct talks with Kim Jong Un; I just won't,\" he said in\u00a0remarks at the Gridiron Dinner last weekend. He even joked about which leader was more challenging. \"As far as the risk of dealing with a madman is concerned,\" he said, \"that's his problem, not mine.\"\n\u00a0\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2G9VSIo", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/09/analysis-historic-north-korea-talks-both-trump-and-kim-get-something-they-crave/409844002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Doug Stanglin", "body": "President Trump waves as he walks from Marine One to board Air Force One, on Feb. 2, 2018, in Andrews Air Force Base, Md., en route to Palm Beach International Airport, in West Palm Beach, Fla.(Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP)President Trump tweeted Saturday that the controversial memo released by a House committee \"totally vindicates\" him in the Russian probe.The president's comment, made from his weekend retreat in Mar-a-Lago in Florida, did not indicate whether he planned to take any action to stop the investigation, which is being led by\u00a0special counsel Robert Mueller.This memo totally vindicates \u201cTrump\u201d in probe.

But in the era of Trump, Ginsburg, 84, is packing her schedule and sending signals she intends to keep her seat on the bench for years.The eldest Supreme Court justice has produced two of the court\u2019s four signed opinions so far this term. Outside of court, she\u2019s the subject of a new documentary that includes video of her working out. And she\u2019s hired law clerks to take her through June 2020, just four months before the next presidential election.Soaking in her late-in-life emergence as a liberal icon, she\u2019s using the court\u2019s monthlong break to embark on a speaking tour that is taking her from the Sundance Film Festival in Utah to law schools and synagogues on the East Coast. One talk will have her in Rhode Island on Tuesday, meaning she won\u2019t attend the president\u2019s State of the Union speech that night in Washington.She has a standard response for interviewers who ask how long she intends to serve. She will stay as long as she can go \u201cfull steam,\u201d she says, and she sees as her model John Paul Stevens, who stepped down as a justice in 2010 at age 90.\u201cI think that Justice Ginsburg has made clear that she has no intention of retiring. I am sure she wants to stay on the court until the end of the Trump presidency if she can,\u201d said Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at the University of California, Berkeley, and a liberal who called on Ginsburg to retire in 2014, when Barack Obama was president and Democrats controlled the Senate.But Chemerinsky noted \u201cno one can know whether she will be on the court on Jan. 20, 2021, if Trump serves one term, let alone Jan. 20, 2025, if he is re-elected.\u201dGinsburg doesn\u2019t talk about Trump in public anymore, not since she criticized him in interviews with The Associated Press and other media outlets before the 2016 election. The comments prompted Trump to tweet that \u201cHer mind is shot \u2014 resign!\u201d She later apologized.More: Squat, lift, kick, curl: Justice Ginsburg's workout is tough and it left me exhaustedMore: Sundance: Ruth Bader Ginsburg likes Kate McKinnon's 'SNL' impression and supports #MeTooGinsburg, who declined to comment for this story, this year marks the 25th anniversary of her nomination by President Bill Clinton and her confirmation as the second woman on the court.As Ginsburg and most Americans anticipated Hillary Clinton\u2019s election in 2016, she didn\u2019t commit to retiring but suggested she would give the first female president the chance to replace \u201ca flaming feminist litigator,\u201d as Ginsburg has wryly described herself.When her husband, Martin Ginsburg, died in 2010, Ginsburg said she did not think much about stepping down. If anything, since Stevens\u2019 retirement, she has become more outspoken and visible as the leader of the court\u2019s liberal wing.Two childhood friends from Brooklyn, New York, who retired two decades ago say \u201cKiki,\u201d the nickname they still use for Ginsburg, has kept the same busy schedule for years.\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s slowing down. That\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Ann Kittner, a friend since their days at James Madison High School. Harryette Helsel, who has known Ginsburg since kindergarten, said she\u2019s joked with Ginsburg: \u201cWe\u2019re retired. Why are you working so hard?\u201d They both laughed.Helsel pointed to Ginsburg\u2019s workout routine, which has been in the spotlight in recent years. Ginsburg started working out with a trainer in 1999 after being treated for colorectal cancer. She does an hour twice a week.A book on the workout by her trainer, with a forward by Ginsburg, came out last year. \u201cRBG,\u201d a documentary about the justice that premiered at Sundance, includes video of her doing pushups and throwing a weighted ball, among other exercises. While pulling on a resistance band, she tells her trainer: \u201cThis is light.\u201dThat video may surprise visitors to the court, who can be struck by how slowly Ginsburg moves, her head often bowed, when the court session ends for the day and justices leave the bench in full view of the audience. Justices Samuel Alito and Elena Kagan have taken to waiting until Ginsburg exits because she otherwise would be left by herself as she makes her way to the justices\u2019 robing room.But she has walked at a deliberate pace for years. Once, after remaining seated well after the other justices had departed, she explained that she had accidentally kicked off a shoe during the arguments and couldn\u2019t locate it with her feet.Ginsburg usually grips a handrail to go down the few steps from the bench in the courtroom. But there was no railing for her to grab on a November day when she followed a director\u2019s instructions through several takes and climbed the steps in front of the courthouse for a scene in \u201cOn the Basis of Sex,\u201d a movie about Ginsburg\u2019s rise in the legal profession that is due out this year.Ginsburg\u2019s friend Ann Claire Williams, a newly retired federal appeals court judge, said sometimes people get the wrong idea from Ginsburg\u2019s small stature and think she is frail.\u201cShe is so spry,\u201d said Williams, adding that Ginsburg\u2019s mind is also sharp, and her recall on cases \u201cextraordinary.\u201dTrump remarked during the campaign that he might get to name four justices while president. But conservatives hoping to lock in a majority on the court during Trump\u2019s presidency would be happy for now with just one more vacancy. They are focused not on Ginsburg, but on the prospect that Justice Anthony Kennedy might retire this year. Kennedy, too, has hired law clerks for next term, a possible hint he plans on staying. The Above the Law blog first reported on Ginsburg\u2019s and Kennedy\u2019s clerk hirings.Ginsburg\u2019s decision to stay on past Obama\u2019s time in the White House upset progressives because they feared \u2013 and conservatives now hope \u2013 a more conservative justice might replace her.\u201cThe assumption was she can\u2019t go \u2018til she\u2019s 87, but maybe she will,\u201d said Curt Levey, president of the conservative Committee for Justice.She has been counted out before, wrongly.When Ginsburg had a second cancer surgery, for pancreatic cancer in 2009, Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., inelegantly forecast that she would die within a year. He later apologized.In a speech just over a year later, Ginsburg said, \u201cI am pleased to report that, contrary to Sen. Bunning\u2019s prediction, I am alive and in good health.\u201dBunning died last year.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2DP0aX7", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/27/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-84-no-hurry-retire/1072098001/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Erin Kelly", "body": "Reps.

That probe includes looking into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians and possible obstruction of justice by President Trump in his efforts to limit the investigation.The committee's Republican majority voted Monday night to declassify and release the four-page memo, while Democrats opposed it. Republicans also blocked the release\u00a0of a rebuttal memo written by Democrats.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2rZRokn", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/02/trump-approves-release-controversial-nunes-memo-fbi-surveillance-russia-campaign/1082196001/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "David Jackson", "body": "President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, along with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0In a morning of unusual tweets, President Trump on Wednesday criticized his Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u00a0over a newly announced investigation into alleged abuse of surveillance powers \u2014\u00a0a probe Trump himself advocated for months.\nIn a mid-morning tweet, Trump protested Sessions' decision to have his Inspector General investigate the handling of\u00a0Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants, rather than\u00a0Justice Department prosecutors.\n\"Why is A.G.

The Senate hasn't taken up the bill yetIn December, the House voted mostly along party lines to expand the right to carry concealed weapons, in what NRA's top lobbyist Chris Cox called a \"watershed moment for Second Amendment Rights.\"And just this week, Trump's 2019 budget proposal to Congress proposed a 16% cut in federal grants to help states boost their reporting of criminal records and protection orders to the national database used for background checks on gun purchasers.NRA officials did not immediately respond to an interview request Thursday,Those\u00a0Washington wins\u00a0come after record spending in the 2016 election by gun-rights forces.The National Rifle Association and other gun-rights\u00a0organizations spent nearly $55 million in the 2016 election cycle to oppose or support candidates through independent spending \u2014 nearly 19 times the amount spent by groups promoting gun restrictions, according to a tally be the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.Trump was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the NRA's spending in the last election, with the group pumping more than $31 million\u00a0into advertising to boost his candidacy and to attack his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.In addition, more than $61 million in NRA money has gone to back current members of Congress, most of which benefited Republicans. Topping the list: Arizona Sen. John McCain, a former GOP presidential nominee, who benefited from $7.7 million in NRA spending over his political career, according to the Center's data.Bess Kalb, a\u00a0writer for Jimmy Kimmel Live! has thrown a fresh spotlight on NRA's political spending this week, responding to lawmakers who are offering \"thoughts and prayers\" to the victims of Wednesday's\u00a0shooting in Florida, with tweets showing how much members of Congress\u00a0have benefited from the group's political spending.\u00a0$3,124,273 from the NRA. https://t.co/mgEnOsC03p\u2014 Bess Kalb (@bessbell) February 15, 2018The NRA's use of independent spending \u2014 on ads, mailers and emails \u2014 to mobilize voters has made it \"one of the most powerful political organizations in America,\" said Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor and author of 2011 book, Gun Fight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.\"Politicians don't listen to the NRA simply because they spend money, they listen to the NRA because the NRA's money is effectively spent swaying voters,\" he said.Sheila Krumholz, of the Center for Responsive Politics, said it's not just money that gives the NRA influence, but its active membership of nearly five million activists.\"The money is a megaphone for another significant asset: a powerful base,\" she said.\u00a0Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2GgI51N", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/15/nras-big-spending-pays-off-clout-and-wins-washington/341257002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jeffrey Schweers", "body": "CLOSE\n\n\n\n\n\n    Hear what students, parents and teachers affected by school shootings told President Donald Trump.\n    USA TODAY\n\n\n\nThis Feb. 21 photo shows Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student Cameron Kasky, left, asking a question to Sen.

Rick Scott unveiled a $500 million plan to address safety in schools.\n    USA TODAY\n\n\n\nThe gun legislation being offered is mostly cosmetic, she added. For example, raising the age to 21 for rifle purchases is woefully inadequate. The Sutherland Springs, Texas, shooter was 26. The Pulse nightclub shooter was 29. The Las Vegas shooter was 64.\n\u201cSo raising the age does not address the problem which is the easy availability of semiautomatic weapons and large magazines,\u201d Brigham said.\u00a0She said the Legislature also needs to close the gun show loophole and provide universal background checks.\nBut she is glad for the chance to debate these issues in the Legislature, and glad some of the more extreme proposals are not being embraced.\n\u201cI am feeling positive there is finally a conversation happening among our lawmakers about gun violence,\u201d Brigham said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue. It\u2019s a public safety issue that affects all Americans no matter what the party.\u201d\nMomentum has been building in Florida since Pulse, said Joe Saunders, the senior political director for Equality Florida. It took the effort of LGBT advocates to force Gov. Scott and the Legislature to recognize the shooting as a hate crime and drop the original narrative that it was a terrorist attack orchestrated by ISIS.\n\u201cThe fact that the Pulse shooting happened to Latino people who were LGBT did affect the response we got from legislators,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cIt affected the words out of their mouth, what happened at that moment and whether they were willing to listen.\u201d\nPulse survivors were among the first to go to Parkland students, provide comfort and stand with them in Tallahassee, he said.\n\u201cThe world that watched what happened at Pulse are the same people that watched what happened at Parkland,\u201d Saunders said.\nThe coalition is not pleased that\u00a0the Legislature has\u00a0not address background checks and banning assault weapons. And there are huge differences in the governor\u2019s plan and what\u2019s been laid out by the House and Senate. For instance, the governor doesn\u2019t support arming teachers, while the House and Senate\u00a0propose\u00a0arming teachers.\nBut at least they are finally at a point where debate is happening, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting that after 10 years the Legislature is willing in this moment to have a conversation about gun safety reform,\u201d he said.\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2ows9Rx", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/02/24/parkland-school-shooting-seen-turning-point-gun-control-debate/369914002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kevin Johnson", "body": "Andrew McCabe appears before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing on 'World Wide Threats', on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, USA, 11 May 2017.(Photo: MICHAEL REYNOLDS, EPA-EFE)WASHINGTON \u2013 FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who has been a target of unrelenting criticism from President Trump, abruptly announced his resignation Monday, according to a senior government official who was not authorized to comment publicly on personnel matters.\u00a0McCabe was expected to resign in March when he was eligible for retirement and full benefits.

Dianne Feinstein of California, for having some \"very good ideas.\"\nHe wants a legislative response to the latest mass shooting in Parkland, Fla.,\u00a0that's \"comprehensive\"\u00a0\u2014 and, of course, \"beautiful.\"\u00a0And he promised lawmakers they'd be \"popular\" if they were \"very powerful\"\u00a0on an expansion of background checks.\nHere are some of the most amazing things Trump said:\n1. The trouble with due processTrump liked an idea Vice President Pence promoted to give families and law enforcement greater ability to get a court order and collect all of a person's weapons if the individual is a potential danger to his or herself or others.\nBut he had one problem:\u00a0Court takes \"so long...to get the due process procedures.\"\n\"I like taking the guns early,\" he said. \"Take the guns first, go through due process second.\"\nA lack of due process was one of the arguments gun-rights advocates made against an Obama-era rule that would have barred gun ownership by some who were deemed mentally impaired by the Social Security Administration. Trump signed legislation overturning the rule last year.\n2. Who\u2019s afraid of the NRA?Answer: According Trump, Sen. Patrick Toomey, R-Penn., for one.\nTrump wanted to know why background check legislation authored by Toomey and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., doesn\u2019t raise the age for buying an AR-15 \u2014\u00a0like the one used in the Parkland shooting \u2014\u00a0from 18 to 21, the minimum age for buying a handgun. The NRA opposes increasing the age limit, but Trump said they should consider the move.\nToomey said the bill didn\u2019t address it.\n\u201cYou know why? Because you're afraid of the NRA, right?\u201d Trump said. \u201cA lot of people are afraid of that issue.\u201d\n3. Concealed carryTrump rejected repeated requests from House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., to consider including an expansion of concealed carry rights as part of a comprehensive bill. Scalise, the survivor of a shooting at\u00a0congressional baseball game practice last year, said the NRA-backed legislation would make people safer.\n\"If you add concealed carry to this, you\u2019ll never get it passed,\"\u00a0Trump said.\u00a0 \"We want to get something done.\"\nThe House already passed the bill alongside another measure designed to measure to boost authorities' reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, NICS. But concealed carry likely would have a tougher time passing the Senate, where it would need Democratic votes to pass.\n4. 'I\u2019m not into popularity'Trump, while promoting an expansion of background checks, promised members that would make them \"more popular.\"\n\u201cPeople are afraid to do background checks because you\u2019re afraid of somebody,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care who\u2019s endorsing you or not endorsing you. You\u2019re going to be more popular if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into. I\u2019m not into popularity, I\u2019m into getting something done that\u2019s good.\u201d\n5. It's Obama\u2019s faultThe Toomey-Manchin bill failed to advance in 2013. The authors had 54 votes when they needed 60.\nWhen the president\u00a0asked whether they had \"presidential backup,\"\u00a0Manchin said \"that was our problem.\"\nToomey: \"President Obama did support it, but...\"\nTrump: \"But that was your problem.\"\nToomey: \"There was a worry he wanted to go further, frankly, and that was a concern for some of our guys.\"\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2oFP39n", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/02/28/due-process-obama-five-amazing-things-trump-told-lawmakers-during-meeting-guns/382781002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kevin Johnson", "body": "President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 For months, Attorney General Jeff Sessions had absorbed every taunt and Twitter bomb lobbed his way by a displeased boss.\nLike so many political rivals he dispatched during a scorched-earth campaign for the White House, President Trump has publicly shamed his attorney general as weak or beleaguered.\nAll the while, Sessions, one of the president\u2019s earliest and most vocal supporters, largely sat silent \u2014 until now.\nSessions\u2019 quick response Wednesday to Trump\u2019s latest Twitter lashing \u2014 calling the attorney general \u201cdisgraceful\u201d for choosing the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general instead of prosecutors to review alleged surveillance abuses of a former Trump campaign aide \u2014 amounts to a dramatic break in the attorney general\u2019s already rocky relationship with Trump.\n\u201cAs long as I am the attorney general,\u201d Sessions said Wednesday, \u201cI will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor.\u201d\nWhile the language was measured, the meaning was not.\nIntentionally or not, Sessions added an explanation point hours later when he was photographed at a local restaurant\u00a0dining with Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, another target of Trump\u2019s ire for his support of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiry into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election.\nThe fast-moving developments appear to signal an almost certain reckoning between the president and his attorney general whose alliance was irrevocably altered a year ago when Sessions recused himself from managing the Russia inquiry.\nTwo former attorneys general rallied to Sessions' defense Thursday, including Edwin Meese who said that Trump's treatment of the former Alabama senator has been certainly unfair and likely unprecedented.\n\"I know it's not always his way to respond (to the president), but it was important for Jeff to stand behind the (Justice Department) when it is doing the right thing,\" said Meese, who served in the Reagan administration.\nMeese\u00a0said Trump's\u00a0attorney general has done more to \"further the president's agenda than anybody\" on immigration enforcement, combating violent crime and opioid abuse.\n\"I can't explain it.\"\"I can't explain it,\" Meese said of the president's criticism.\nWilliam \"Bill\" Barr, an attorney general to President George H.W. Bush, said it was important for the public to hear from Sessions in wake of Trump's latest criticism.\n\"I think he was reminding the American people of a key attribute that we need\u00a0 in an attorney general and that is integrity,\" Barr said. \"He's saying, 'Look, I'm calling things as I see it.' \"\nTrump's latest offensive against Sessions, the most pointed criticism since last spring and summer,\u00a0is fraught with risk.\u00a0\nAny move to oust Sessions could be viewed as an attempt to wrest control of Mueller's wide-ranging inquiry. That investigation includes whether the\u00a0president has sought to obstruct the probe.\n\"If Trump removes Sessions, Mueller would have to look at this very carefully in combination with the president's dismissal of (former FBI Director James) Comey as an effort to damage, derail or slowdown the Russia investigation,\" said Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor.\nCotter said Trump's past tweets and public statements have already demonstrated the president's disappointment in Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia inquiry last year. Indeed,\u00a0Trump was so angry with Sessions' recusal that the attorney general offered his resignation, which the president did not accept.)\nFormer U.S. attorney general Edwin Meese, left,  speaks while flanked by FBI Director James Comey and former congressman Timothy Roemer, D-Ind., during a news conference at FBI headquarters held to discuss the recent review of the 9/11 Commission Report.\u00a0(Photo: Mark Wilson, Getty Images)\n\n\"And in the (May) interview with NBC, he acknowledged firing Comey because of his handling of the Russia investigation. Whatever Trump does, it seems to make it easier for prosecutors,\" Cotter said.\nThe political costs of removing Sessions could be just as risky.\nThe attorney general still enjoys fairly strong support among Republicans for aggressively pursuing Trump's agenda at the Justice Department.\nIn addition to focusing attention on recent spikes in homicide, he has ordered a sweeping review of police reform agreements that punished troubled agencies; rolled back a series of Obama-era civil rights actions, including a Justice Department challenge to a controversial voter identification law in Texas; and threatened so-called sanctuary cities for harboring illegal immigrants.\nIn January, the attorney general also paved the way for tougher marijuana enforcement when he rescinded the previous administration's policy of non-interference with state laws allowing the use\u00a0of medical and recreational pot.\nEarlier this week, Rep. Pete King, R-N.Y., citing Sessions' loyalty, said the president should refrain from publicly rebuking the attorney general.\n\"Jeff Sessions is loyal to the president, and he's one of the first to support him,\" King said on Fox News. \"He's often in very difficult positions, and I think he's trying to reconcile as best as he can.\"\nBut Republican support is not unanimous.\nHouse Freedom Caucus leaders Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Jim Jordan of Ohio called for the attorney general to step down. The congressmen, citing Sessions' recusal from the Russia inquiry, assert that the attorney general can no longer adequately manage the department and the FBI.\nTrump's attacks on Sessions and the possible implications for the Russia investigation, however, have spawned some unlikely alliances with some\u00a0Democrats urging Sessions to remain.\nCarry onIn January, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who voted against Sessions' confirmation, said the attorney general should not resign.\n\"Nothing, nothing should ever interfere with the Mueller investigation,\" he said then.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Thursday that she knew of no plans for Trump to fire Sessions.\nMeanwhile, Sessions\u00a0is drawing inspiration and encouragement from some of the same men whose portraits hang in his fifth-floor conference room at the Justice Department.\nOne of them, Meese, said he has spoken to the attorney general recently and urged him to carry on.\n\"I was impressed,\" Meese said. \"He was in good spirits. I told him he was doing a great job.\"\nContributing: David Jackson\nMore: Attorney General Sessions: Adverse immigration court rulings smack of 'judicial superiority'\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2oIEwKu", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/01/trump-and-sessions-face-reckoning-relationship-turns-bitter-and-divisive-public/384786002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kevin Johnson", "body": "In this file photo taken on September 28, 2017 FBI Director Christopher Wray attends his installation ceremony as director at FBI Headquarters in Washington, DC.\nUS President Donald Trump publicly attacked the FBI's leadership on February 2, 2018, accusing them of politicizing their investigations in favor of Democrats as he gets set to approve the release of an explosive memo alleging the agency's abuse of power.

The director did not characterize the nature of that information.\"I'm quite confident that the FBI followed established protocols,\" Wray said.Porter, who has denied the allegations he abused two ex-wives, resigned last week. His departure was quickly followed by David Sorensen, a White House\u00a0speechwriter, also accused of domestic\u00a0abuse. Sorensen has denied his former wife's claims.Yet the White House's handling of the matters, specifically Porter, has largely focused on chief of staff John Kelly.As Porter announced his resignation mid-day Wednesday,\u00a0Kelly issued a statement calling him \"a man of true integrity and honor.\" Hours later,\u00a0after pictures surfaced showing one of Porter's ex-wives with a black eye, Kelly issued a more critical statement\u00a0saying he \"was shocked\" by \"the new allegations released today.\"Kelly said in that second statement that \"there is no place for domestic violence in our society,\" but he added that \"I stand by my previous comments of the Rob Porter that I have come to know since becoming chief of staff, and believe every individual deserves the right to defend their reputation.\"\u00a0More: White House staffer Rob Porter resigns amid abuse allegationsMore: Rob Porter scandal, explained: Who is he, why he resigned, what his ex-wives say, moreAs questions continued to swirl over how the two officials were permitted to join the White House staff, Trump has appeared to side with the accused men.

McMaster as National Security Adviser. Here is a look at Bolton's background.\n    USA TODAY\n\n\n\nBy electing Trump and tolerating Bolton, America has shown it is not a trustworthy steward of the free world. The damage gets deeper by the day.\nPresident Trump(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\n\nFrom Stormy Daniels to John Bolton, the United States of America will not recover from the presidency of Donald Trump.\nThis is a bold statement, and in a literal sense, it is not true. The United States will exist long after President Trump either steps down after two terms, is defeated for re-election, or is otherwise removed from office.\nBut as a global superpower and the leader of an alliance of free nations, America will not soon \u2014 if ever \u2014 recover the same position of leadership it has occupied since the end of World War II. Bolton\u2019s arrival is a harbinger not of war but of further chaos. He will be in a job no one wanted and for which he was chosen because of his repeated appearances on the president\u2019s only pipeline to reality, Fox News.\nLike much of Washington, Bolton himself seemed taken aback by the news\u00a0\u2014 although this was\u00a0an obvious call the Trump administration has been telegraphing for weeks. Overseas, our allies are maintaining a polite silence, since Bolton will be personal staff to the president. But it is hard to imagine\u00a0they think the accession of a man of almost cartoonishly hawkish views is a good sign for American foreign policy.\nMore: John Bolton will finally let Donald Trump be Donald Trump on foreign policy\nMore: Donald Trump's foolish legal strategy on women is weakening the presidency\nBolton alone cannot destroy American foreign policy. Neither can Trump, who is hardly the first flawed president. Richard Nixon threatened the Constitution and was driven from office. Bill Clinton subjected us to national moral embarrassment. George W. Bush squandered the international goodwill engendered by the tragedy of 9/11 by expanding a just war in Afghanistan into a fiasco in Iraq. Barack Obama, in a single-minded pursuit of a legacy with Iran, removed the United States from vital positions of power in Europe and the Middle East, and outsourced global security to China and Russia.\nAnd yet, all of these were recoverable errors. Clinton was a passable president, a centrist in domestic affairs and a committed leader of the NATO alliance. Bush reassured a terrified nation, and his errors, in hindsight, seem less nefarious than incompetent. Obama is a decent man who did what his voters asked him to do, even when it was wrong.\u00a0\nIn earlier days, we elected a haberdasher and an actor to the Oval Office, and both turned out to be great presidents. A callow playboy from Boston faced down a major nuclear threat from the Soviet Union. Even Nixon\u2019s undeniable accomplishments in foreign affairs gave his eventual downfall a certain tragic grandeur.\nMeanwhile, the rest of the world regarded the United States with a mixture of awe and condescension. We were sneered at by European intellectuals, secretly envied by Communist apparatchiks, and hated by less-developed nations who resented our incredible wealth. But friends and enemies both had to accept that America was a serious nation, run by serious people who always rose to the obligations of global leadership.\nDonald Trump is different. The 45th president\u00a0has shown himself to be utterly unserious about foreign affairs. In just the past few weeks he has lied to the Canadian prime minister (or lied about lying, it is now unclear)\u00a0and suggested, yet again, that America might abandon allies who don\u2019t ante up their protection money. He has impulsively thrown out offers to meet with Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un,\u00a0and sent the market plunging at the prospect of international\u00a0trade wars.\nNow, having rid himself of his meddlesome priest, the too-serious H.R. McMaster, he has brought aboard a man who will insist on speaking his mind at will, much as the president does, and this will only make matters worse.\nMore: North Korea sets a dangerous trap for\u00a0 Donald Trump\nMore: GOP's crazy Russia probe conspiracies are crushed in Fusion GPS transcript\nPOLICING THE USA:\u00a0A\u00a0look at\u00a0race, justice, media\nAll of this reveals a great shift in American politics. By electing Trump and tolerating Bolton, we have shown that we are not a nation that can be consistently trusted with the stewardship of the free world. It\u2019s not that Trump, in the end, will collapse NATO, plunge us into a great depression, or start World War III \u2014 although with Bolton by his side he is capable of doing all of those things \u2014 but rather that the American voters have shown the world that we are capable of astonishing selfishness and petulance. We have abandoned our civic virtue not just at home, but overseas, and once lost, that position cannot be recovered.\nPerhaps this is all too pessimistic. Americans have elected men of weak moral character and shallow political commitment to office before. But not when it mattered so much, and certainly not since the advent of the era in which the President of United States \u2014the sole steward of an arsenal of weapons that can extinguish civilization itself \u2014 became the leader and protector not only of millions of his own citizens, but of the billions of others who rely on America as a friend and ally.\nThe most optimistic outcome is that decades from now the memory of the Trump years fades away, and both we and the world look upon this period as an aberration, a kind of fever or temporary insanity from which we awoke just before we lost any possibility of an American restoration. But the damage is getting deeper by the day. Healing it will take more than just electing a new president: it will require years of painful self-examination, and calling ourselves to account honestly and transparently. Only then will we begin to earn back the presumption of trust and leadership that was once one of our proudest achievements as a free nation.\nTom Nichols is\u00a0a\u00a0professor of national security affairs at the\u00a0Naval War College,\u00a0a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and\u00a0author of\u00a0The Death of Expertise.\u00a0The views expressed here are solely his own.

The airline said it was an effort to remain neutral in the debate over gun policies, after the shooting deaths of 17 people on Feb. 14 at a Florida high school.\nThe airline doesn't disclose how many discount programs it has, airline spokesman Trebor Banstetter said. Delta had sold just 13 tickets under the discount program with the NRA, he said.\nThe NRA and conservatives in the Georgia legislature argued the change represented punishment for people who cherish the 2nd Amendment. Lawmakers threatened to remove a jet-fuel tax break, which had an estimated $40 million benefit for Delta, from a larger tax package unless the carrier reversed course.\n\u201cOur decision was not made for economic gain and our values are not for sale,\u201d Bastian said. \u201cThis decision followed the NRA\u2019s controversial statements after the recent school shootings in Florida. Our discounted travel benefit for NRA members could be seen as Delta implicitly endorsing the NRA. That is not the case.\u201d\n\"Our objective in removing any implied affiliation with the NRA was to remove Delta from this debate,\" Bastian said.\nOn Thursday, the state Senate passed the tax measure 44-10 after removing the jet-fuel provision. The House \u2013 which had passed an earlier version with the jet-fuel provision \u2013 followed with a 135-24 vote.\nGovernors of New York and Virginia, a House lawmaker from Ohio and the mayor of Birmingham, Ala., were among officials who jabbed Georgia in the dispute and offered to have Delta move its headquarters from Atlanta.\nBut Bastian said the airline is staying put.\n\u201cNone of this changes the fact that our home is Atlanta and we are proud and honored to locate our headquarters here. And we are supporters of the 2nd Amendment, just as we embrace the entire Constitution of the United States.\u201d\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2oK4PQw", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/02/delta-reviews-all-fare-discount-programs-after-nra-dispute-costs-georgia-tax-break/388587002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Richard Wolf", "body": "A federal court on Monday rejected Pennsylvania Republicans' effort to rejuvenate their preferred congressional district map for the November elections.(Photo: Jack Gruber, USAT)\n\n\nEfforts by Pennsylvania's Republican leaders to rejuvenate a map of congressional districts that overwhelming favors their party were rejected in court again Monday.\nHaving failed at the state court level to save their own map or block one drawn last month by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court,\u00a0legislative leaders had sought federal court intervention.\nBut while awaiting action by\u00a0the U.S. Supreme Court, the challengers failed to win an endorsement from a three-judge federal district court. The panel concluded unanimously that the GOP leaders lacked standing to bring the case on behalf of the entire legislature.\nThe dispute has national implications because Democrats could win back the U.S. House of Representatives in November. The court-drawn map would give them a better chance of winning several congressional races in Pennsylvania.\nThe three judges \u2014\u00a0all appointed by Republican presidents \u2014\u00a0acted one day before the filing deadline for May's primary elections.\nA ruling from the Supreme Court has been awaited\u00a0 for two weeks.\u00a0In February, the justices refused to block a state Supreme Court decision that declared districts drawn by Republicans unconstitutional because of their partisan tilt.\u00a0\nAfter that ruling, the state court redrew the lines. Republicans then challenged the new maps as improperly drawn and asked that 2018 elections be held under the old lines, beginning with a May primary.\u00a0\nThe Pennsylvania battle is one of many concerning so-called partisan gerrymandering by state legislatures that have raised the political stakes on the eve of the 2018 midterm elections, when Republican control of Congress and many state legislatures is up for grabs.\nMore: Political maps under fire as Supreme Court case on tailor-made districts looms\nMore: Supreme Court to hear second case challenging election districts\nMore: Analysis: Supreme Court debates politics, and Kennedy's silence speaks volumes\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the GOP-drawn map of congressional districts\u00a0\"plainly and palpably violates the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\" The judges demanded new maps within weeks and threatened to design their own if state officials did\u00a0not comply.\nOnce the deadline had passed, the court came up with its own map \u2014\u00a0one that likely would end Republicans' ability to win 13 of the state's 18 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Across the country, every new opportunity for Democrats increases the party's chances of retaking the House in November. That would be a major setback for the Trump administration.\nThe Pennsylvania court's action in January followed by weeks a\u00a0federal judge's ruling striking down North Carolina's similarly\u00a0partisan\u00a0maps. The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked that ruling while it considers complaints from Wisconsin and Maryland that could result in a landmark ruling on partisan gerrymandering this spring.\nThe justices have been considering the Wisconsin challenge to state Assembly districts since hearing oral arguments in early October. They are\u00a0scheduled to hear a challenge to one Maryland congressional district next week. The court's decisions could affect other states as well.\nAlthough Pennsylvania is closely divided between Democrats and Republicans, maps drawn by the GOP in 2011 resulted in the\u00a013-5 Republican edge in the state's congressional delegation. Similarly partisan maps produced a 10-3 GOP advantage in North Carolina, 12-4 in Ohio and 9-5 in Michigan \u2014\u00a0three states that are more closely divided between Democrats and Republicans than those ratios suggest.\nThe Pennsylvania map was possible because Republicans win the GOP districts with an average of 59%, while Democrats win theirs with an average of 77%. In that way, the challengers' lawsuit claimed, the legislature \"packed\" Democratic voters into some districts and \"cracked\" them among the others.\n\u00a0\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2u6bIlc", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/19/republicans-lose-again-fight-over-pennsylvania-u-s-house-map/438940002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Carolyn Mcatee Cerbin", "body": "Carolyn McAtee Cerbin, USA TODAY\n            Published 8:20 p.m. ET March 18, 2018\n        \nPresident Trump looking out a White House window.\u00a0(Photo: The Motley Fool)\n\nPresident Trump asked senior White House staff members to sign confidentiality agreements,\u00a0much like he did as a private citizen, according to a reported column in The Washington Post.\nPost\u00a0columnist Ruth Marcus\u00a0wrote she obtained a draft of the non-disclosure agreement, calling it a \"doozy.\" If found violating the NDA,\u00a0staffers would be penalized $10 million, to be paid to the government.

Chris Coons, D-Del.\nTrump backers say Bolton will help bring some much-needed toughness to American foreign policy, an approach they say has yielded results like the prospective meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\u201cI know John Bolton well and believe he is an excellent choice who will do a great job,\" said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.\nBolton, 69, has never been shy about expressing his views, not as a student at Yale, a lawyer, a State Department official during the George W. Bush administration, Bush's ambassador to the United Nations, and, more recently a columnist and Fox News commentator.\nThrough it all, Bolton has been what he calls \"a staunch defender of American interests,\" someone who has \"repeatedly advocated tough measures against the nuclear weapons programs of both Iran and North Korea, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction generally.\"\nCritics worry that Bolton \u2014\u00a0the administration's third national\u00a0 security adviser in less than 15 months \u2014\u00a0will push Trump to take even more aggressive stands toward\u00a0Iran and North Korea, perhaps triggering military conflict that involves nuclear weapons.\nLike the president who picked him, Bolton has been a fierce critic\u00a0of the Iran nuclear agreement, and his appointment could spell the end of that deal.\u00a0Under the agreement, Iran gives up the means to make nuclear weapons as the United States and allies reduces economic sanctions on Tehran.\nIf Trump and Bolton kill off the deal, something they can do starting with a certification deadline in May, analysts said Iran will simply resume a nuclear weapons program. The result could be a de-stabilized Middle East \u2014\u00a0Iranian rival Saudi Arabia has said it may be pursue nuclear weapons of its own if necessary \u2014\u00a0and increased potential for war.\nAs for North Korea, Bolton the media commentator has expressed skepticism about Trump's planned meeting with Kim Jong Un later this year. Bolton has said Trump should demand an immediate commitment from the North Korean leader,\u00a0\u00a0or consider \"something else\" \u2014\u00a0presumably a preemptive military strike at North Korea's military program.\n\"It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current 'necessity'\u00a0posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons by striking first,\" Bolton wrote in The Wall Street Journal in late February.\nHe has expressed similar views about Iran.\nMore: Trump picks John Bolton to replace McMaster as national security adviser\nMore: 5 facts about John Bolton, Trump's new national security adviser\nBolton was, and remains, a proponent of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, a point his critics emphasized in expressing concern about future relations with Iran and North Korea.\nSen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a veteran of the Iraq\u00a0War, said Bolton's record is \"all the proof anyone should need\" that he lacks the judgement to be national security adviser. She noted that Bolton has spoken of preemptive bombing of North Korea and Ian, \"having apparently learned nothing\" from mistakes in Iraq.\n\"His appointment to this critical role could be catastrophic for both our national security and the troops who could be put in danger because of the advice he gives to Donald Trump,\" Duckworth said.\nBolton's \"appointment to this critical role could be catastrophic for both our national security and the troops who could be put in danger because of the advice he gives to Donald Trump,\" said Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat and veteran of the Iraq war.\u00a0(Photo: SHAWN THEW, EPA-EFE)\n\nThere are other challenges on Trump's foreign policy front.\nTrump appointed Bolton just hours after he announced a plan to hit China with tariffs over what he called unfair trade practices. As China threatened retaliatory penalties on U.S. goods, business groups feared the onset of a trade war that would raise consumer prices worldwide. Bolton has also criticized Chinese trade practices.\nBolton also arrives amid Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, including whether the Trump campaign had any role.\nIn his media commentary, Bolton has questioned evidence linking the Russians to email hacks of Democratic Party officials, and said it may have been a \"false flag\" operation.\nOver the past year, analysts have seen soon-to-be-former National Security Adviser H.R.

Bernie Sanders of New Hampshire, the former Democratic presidential candidate. Speaking on MSNBC, Sanders said that \"we have got to do everything possible to make it clear that if Trump forces Mueller, this is, in fact, an impeachable offense.

James Lankford, R-Okla., also speaking on ABC's This Week.\u00a0Former New Jersey Gov.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller and would\u00a0presumably have the power to remove him.\u00a0\nIn calling on Rosenstein to shut down the probe,\u00a0Trump attorney John Dowd cited the dismissal of McCabe as well as a much-disputed\u00a0dossier that makes unproven claims about\u00a0Trump campaign cooperation with Russians who used to hacks and fake news to spread negative attacks on 2016 Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\nDowd called on Rosenstein to \"bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe\u2019s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier.\"\nLast week, Rosenstein told USA TODAY that there is no reason to dismiss Mueller, saying \"the\u00a0special counsel is not an unguided missile ..

In a statement, McCabe also said he has been a witness to Trump's 2017 decision to fire Comey as FBI director, an event central to the obstruction of justice investigation.\n\"It is part of this Administration's ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel investigation, which continue to this day,\" McCabe said. \"Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the Special Counsel's work.\"\nWhile Trump hailed McCabe's dismissal as a great day for the FBI, Comey defended his former deputy and sent a warning to the president.\n\"Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,\" Comey tweeted over the weekend. \"And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.\"\nComey's book \u2014\u00a0A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership\u2014\u00a0is scheduled to be published in mid-April.\nDuring his Sunday morning tweet storm, Trump challenged news reports that McCabe has notes taken during the time of\u00a0Comey's firing.

Still, some Republicans are alarmed that about the possibility and warning that Mueller's investigation should be allowed to play out unimpeded. (March 19)\n    AP\n\n\n\nCongressional Republicans have a duty to draw a red line against Trump's attacks on the special counsel: Our view\nRobert Mueller(Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP)\n\n\n\u00a0\nAs Robert Mueller's investigation gains momentum, President\u00a0Trump's rhetoric against the special counsel grows more threatening.\u00a0Mueller's inquiry\u00a0is \"a total witch hunt with massive conflicts of interest,\" the president complained in a tweet this week.\nAt best, the president is trying to soften up Mueller in the court of public opinion \u2014 and test\u00a0the limits of Republican loyalty. At worst, he is laying the groundwork to act on his brooding instincts and fire Mueller, who was appointed by the Justice Department to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election and any related crimes.\nThat makes it imperative for congressional Republicans who care about the rule of law to establish their own \"red line\"\u00a0\u2014 and to work with Democrats to pass legislation to protect Mueller's inquiry by statute.\nREP. ANDY BIGGS: Mueller should recuse himself or resign\nFiring Mueller wouldn't be as easy as dismissing FBI Director James Comey last year or Secretary of State Rex Tillerson this month. Mueller can be dismissed\u00a0only by the deputy attorney general, who would presumably resign rather than carry out Trump's order.\u00a0But the president could engineer it, nonetheless,\u00a0by terminating enough Justice Department officials until he had his way.\nMost Republicans\u00a0have been shamefully silent about\u00a0this prospect, made more plausible in recent days by Trump castigating Mueller by name for the first time.\nA few\u00a0Republicans have offered tepid support for the special prosecutor. Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah called firing Mueller \"the stupidest thing\" Trump could do. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said it \"would be the beginning of the end of his presidency.\"\nBut can we be sure about that? Would a\u00a0GOP-led Congress that can barely agree on short-term government funding coalesce around the\u00a0monumental and inevitably partisan task of impeachment?\nTrump would have his reasons for firing Mueller, however contrived. By regulation, the special counsel\u00a0can be dismissed\u00a0for, among other things, a \"conflict of interest or other good cause,\" and the president is already drumming up those grounds with his confrontational tweets.\nSuch\u00a0concocted logic might\u00a0be enough for die-hard Trump supporters in the House to sway squeamish colleagues into blocking\u00a0impeachment. Meanwhile, the president would have at least momentarily frustrated an investigation that could threaten his power and his finances.\nMueller's case is, after all, advancing. He already has obtained five guilty pleas, and he has indicted\u00a0former Trump campaign manager\u00a0Paul Manafort, 13 Russians and three Russian entities.\u00a0Trump's recent Twitter outburst\u00a0came just as the White House was reported to have\u00a0gotten a list of questions from Mueller's office that provide\u00a0a hint of the investigation's focus.\nGvien the stakes, it's not enough for GOP lawmakers to speak up in support of Mueller, a highly respected Republican, former FBI director and decorated Marine. They also\u00a0have a duty to\u00a0safeguard\u00a0his inquiry.\u00a0Two bipartisan measures, pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee,\u00a0would protect him. Both provide\u00a0judicial review of any termination's legitimacy. One would challenge the firing before it's carried out, the other afterward.\u00a0\nPass one of them now, by a veto-proof margin,\u00a0before it's too late.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf you can't see this reader\u00a0poll, please refresh your page.\n\u00a0\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2pso55u", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/03/20/congressional-republicans-must-protect-robert-mueller-now-editorials-debates/439009002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Tom Vanden Brook", "body": "Defense Secretary Jim Mattis(Photo: JONATHAN ERNST, AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0A new policy on transgender troops is slated to go into effect Friday after months of consideration and court challenges,\u00a0and it likely\u00a0will restrict their service.\nIn August, President Trump sent Defense Secretary Jim Mattis a memo ordering him to propose changes to the Obama-era policy that allows transgender troops to serve openly and receive medical treatment, including sexual reassignment surgery.\nMattis made his recommendation on transgender service to the White House in February. If Trump does not accept it, the Pentagon will revert to its pre-2016\u00a0practice that effectively banned\u00a0transgender troops from service on medical grounds, according to the memo.\nMattis, since taking charge at the Pentagon, has emphasized the readiness of troops to deploy and fight. In February, the Pentagon established a policy that dismisses troops if they cannot deploy for a period of one year. Presumably, that principle could affect transgender troops who require medical care that could not be provided in a war zone.\nTrump upended the policy on transgender military service in July. He announced, via Twitter, that transgender troops were no longer welcome in the military, and that the government would no longer pay for their surgeries.\nTrump's twitter announcement\u00a0was not coordinated with the Pentagon, and leaders there scrambled to reassure transgender troops that they would not be kicked out and that there medical care would not be interrupted.\nFederal courts have ruled that the Pentagon must allow transgender troops to volunteer for service. Several transgender recruits have signed up since becoming eligible Jan. 1.\nA RAND Corp. study commissioned by the Pentagon in 2016 found that there could be several thousand transgender troops among the\u00a0active-duty force of one million. The report determined that their medical treatment would have a minimal impact on military readiness.\u00a0\nThe current policy for transgender troops was established in 2016 by then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter. It allows transgender service members to serve openly, seek medical attention and allowed for recruits who have been stable in their gender for 18 months to join the military.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2FTUywx", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/22/trump-decide-friday-new-policy-transgender-troops-likely-limiting-their-service/451332002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Dianne Feinstein", "body": "Dianne Feinstein\n            Published 3:15 a.m. ET March 14, 2018\n        \nRepublican talking points on guns are misleading and absurd, especially the argument that Democrats have no constructive ideas to counter this violence.\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.(Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images)\n\n\nWe\u2019ve heard passionate pleas in recent weeks from students who survived a massacre and lost their friends and teachers. Through their pain, with Wednesday\u2019s National School Walkout and in many other ways,\u00a0this generation of students growing\u00a0up with active-shooter drills is demanding that lawmakers take action to reform gun laws.\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s a lot of misleading information about reasonable measures to ensure gun safety, and it distracts from the fundamental issue at hand: the safety of our children, communities, schools and businesses.\u00a0\nMore: In Florida shooting, red flags and blood-stained classrooms\nMore: Don't\u00a0disrespect Sen. Dianne Feinstein. She's 84, female and essential.\nOne frequent refrain:\u00a0\u201cCriminals don't follow the law.\u201d\u00a0This is absurd on its face. By this logic, we shouldn\u2019t criminalize murder, rape or kidnapping. Laws exist to deter crime, and when a crime is committed, laws are there to ensure punishment is meted out.\nBanning assault weapons won\u2019t prevent all shootings, but contrary to Republican talking points, we already know that banning these military-style weapons does reduce mass killings of six people or more.\u00a0When the original ban was in place from 1994 to 2004, the number of such massacres fell by 37% and the number of people dying from them fell by 43%. After the ban expired, the number of gun massacres killing six or more increased by 183% and the number of people dying from them increased by 239%.\nAnother canard: The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. Tell that to the 49 people killed in Orlando at the Pulse nightclub, where an armed guard was on duty and was unable to prevent the murders.\u00a0\nAnother particularly terrible idea floated recently: arming teachers. How can we expect teachers, who already have too much on their plates, to undergo the same training as law enforcement officers and be able to confront killers armed with AR-15s?\nThe falsehood that is most frustrating, however, is that Democrats have no ideas to counter this violence. That couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\nThe first is getting military-style assault weapons such as\u00a0the AR-15 off the streets.\nThese weapons fire much faster than typical hunting rifles. They fire rounds that are also deadlier than those fired from a hunting rifle. A Parkland radiologist noted that an AR-15 round may leave an exit wound \u201cthe size of an orange.\u201d These weapons are designed to kill people, not animals.\nOur current bill would ban\u00a0205 weapons\u00a0by name, and any other weapons that\u00a0accept a detachable magazine and have one military characteristic. The 1994 ban required two additional characteristics, a loophole that gun manufacturers exploited. We'd close that loophole.\nImportantly, the bill also bans high-capacity magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds. The shooter at the\u00a0 grade school\u00a0in Newtown, Conn., for example, used 30-round magazines.\u00a0\nHigh-capacity magazines also lead to deadlier mass shootings. While law enforcement might\u00a0be able to respond to mass shootings in a matter of minutes, a matter of minutes is all it takes to fire hundreds of rounds. In Las Vegas, for example, the shooter fired\u00a01,100 rounds in just 10 minutes \u2014 110 rounds per minute.\nMore: Reporters sound off: Don't ever suggest the news media 'love mass shootings'\nPOLICING THE USA:\u00a0A\u00a0look at\u00a0race, justice, media\nUnder current law, licensed gun dealers cannot sell a handgun to anyone under 21, but they are allowed to sell assault rifles like the AR-15 to anyone over 18. This policy is dangerous and makes absolutely no sense.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile my preference is to ban assault weapons, ensuring teenagers can\u2019t legally buy these weapons is a commonsense step forward.\nAnother problem is a legal loophole permitting accessories such as\u00a0bump stocks, which allow semiautomatic weapons to fire at the same rate as machine guns. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\u00a0Firearms and Explosives has concluded that it cannot regulate or ban these devices without a new law.\u00a0\nWhile President Trump has directed the ATF to review the issue, if the agency were to reverse its analysis after admitting that it lacks the authority, inevitable\u00a0lawsuits would tie up any regulations banning these devices for years.\nToo often, family and friends were aware that a family member posed a threat to themselves or others but were unable to act. The gun lobby and their allies say we need to take guns away from those who exhibit \"red flags,\"\u00a0but it fails to explain that families and law enforcement have little recourse in these situations.\nBarring someone who does not fall into the one of the nine prohibited purchaser categories from buying\u00a0or keeping weapons can\u00a0be done only through a legal process that few states have in place. Our bill would help states establish a court process to allow family members and law enforcement to petition to bar someone from purchasing or possessing weapons.\nLast, none of the above will make a difference unless we improve the background check system by ensuring that states and federal agencies submit required records and ensure that all sales \u2014 not just those at federally licensed dealers \u2014 require a background check.\nI\u2019m hopeful that the groundswell of activism we\u2019ve seen in the wake of the shooting in\u00a0Parkland, Fla.,\u00a0will see results. The American people have always stood on the side of gun safety, and now they\u2019re making it clear that lawmakers who don\u2019t back these commonsense proposals to save lives will face consequences.\nDianne Feinstein is a Democratic senator from California.

If you don't, you're going to just continue to invite consequences for yourself,\u2019 \u201d he said.Speaking earlier in Mexico City, Tillerson said European counterparts already detected signs of Russia involvement in several elections\u00a0and warned the Mexican government to be on guard.\u201cWe hear this from our European counterparts,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cMy advice would be ... pay attention to what\u2019s happening.\u201dTwo weeks ago,\u00a0the Trump administration declined to impose new sanctions passed by Congress in response to Russian interference in the 2016\u00a0elections.Defending that position, the State Department said implementing the new measures mandated by Congress was\u00a0not necessary because earlier sanctions already in place were \"serving as a deterrent.\"Pompeo, in an interview with the BBC last month, said he still sees Russia primarily as an adversary, sharing the concerns by\u00a0many European governments\u00a0about its subversion. \"I haven't seen a significant decrease in their activity,\" he said.Asked if his concerns extended to the U.S. midterms elections, he said, \"Of course. I have every expectation that they will continue to try and do that, but I'm confident that America will be able to have a free and fair election (and)\u00a0that we will push back in a way that is sufficiently robust that the impact they have on our election won't be great.\"Last year, the director of National Intelligence issued a report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections, saying, among other things, that\u00a0the campaign was ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin.The report,\u00a0viewed as the\u00a0consensus\u00a0among U.S. intelligence\u00a0agencies, said Russia changed its tactics to undermine Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as her chances of winning improved. It also said the covert activities involved\u00a0\u201cRussian government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or 'trolls.'\"While the report said the Russian operatives did not alter the vote count, they gained access to data from some state and local electoral boards.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2nMrFX8", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/02/07/tillerson-russians-already-meddling-u-s-midterm-elections/314560002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jessica Estepa", "body": "Rep.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\nSarkozy and his former chief of staff have denied wrongdoing in the case, which involves funding for his winning 2007 presidential campaign.\nThough an investigation has been underway since 2013, the case gained traction some three years later when French-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine told the online investigative site, Mediapart, that he delivered suitcases from Libya containing 5 million euros ($6.2 million) in cash to Sarkozy and his former chief of staff Claude Gueant.\nA lawyer for Sarkozy did not immediately respond to a message from the AP seeking comments.\nInvestigators are examining claims that Gadhafi\u2019s regime secretly gave Sarkozy 50 million euros overall for the 2007 campaign. Such a sum would be more than double the legal campaign funding limit at the time of 21 million euros. In addition, the alleged payments would violate French rules against foreign financing and declaring the source of campaign funds.\nIn the Mediapart interview published in November 2016, Takieddine said he was given 5 million euros in Tripoli by Gadhafi\u2019s intelligence chief on trips in late 2006 and 2007 and that he gave the money in suitcases full of cash to Sarkozy and Gueant on three occasions. He said the handovers took place in the Interior Ministry, while Sarkozy was interior minister.\nTakieddine has for years been embroiled in his own problems with French justice, centering mainly on allegations he provided illegal funds to the campaign of conservative politician Edouard Balladur for his 1995 presidential election campaign \u2013 via commissions from the sale of French submarines to Pakistan.\nAccording to Le Monde newspaper, investigators have recently handed to magistrates a report in which they detailed how cash circulated within Sarkozy\u2019s campaign team.\nIn January, a French businessman suspected of playing a role in the financing scheme, Alexandre Djouhri, was arrested in London on a warrant issued by France \u201cfor offenses of fraud and money laundering.\u201d Le Monde said French investigators are also in possession of several documents seized at his home in Switzerland.\nSarkozy had a complex relationship with Gadhafi. Soon after becoming the French president, Sarkozy invited the Libyan leader to France for a state visit and welcomed him with high honors. But Sarkozy then put France in the forefront of NATO-led airstrikes against Gadhafi\u2019s troops that helped rebel fighters topple his regime in 2011.\nIt is not the first time that Sarkozy faces legal troubles. In February 2016, he was handed preliminary charges by French magistrates for suspected illegal overspending on his failed 2012 re-election campaign and ordered to stand trial.\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2u2LKPl", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/03/20/former-french-president-nicolas-sarkozy-police-custody-report/440797002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Oren Dorell", "body": "CLOSE\n\n\n\n\n\n    President Vladimir Putin claims that Russia has tested new nuclear weapons.

His\u00a0tough-guy image is well known because he invited\u00a0government photographers to tag along\u00a0as he rode\u00a0on\u00a0horseback while shirtless, treated a tranquilized\u00a0tiger and a polar bear, and flew in an ultralight with migratory birds. But here a few things you might not know about the Russian leader:\nPutin is fabulously wealthy\u00a0According to Russia's\u00a0Central Election Commission,\u00a0Putin earned $860,000 between 2011 and 2016. But estimates of his net worth range from $40 billion to $200 billion. The latter estimate would make Putin, a life-long public servant,\u00a0more than twice as wealthy as Microsoft-founder\u00a0Bill Gates, who holds the title as the world's richest human.\nHow did it happen? As a KGB spy during the Soviet era, Putin maintained ties to organized crime, according to Karen Dawisha, author of\u00a0Putin's Kleptocracy; Who Owns Russia?\u00a0As president, he steers government contracts and the sale of state-owned enterprises to businessmen who support his rule and present him with valuable gifts, Dawisha wrote in 2014.\nThe judo schtick might be just thatPutin has practiced some form of martial arts since he was 14, first with a Russian form called sambo and then switched\u00a0to judo, according to his official biography and interviews. He told NPR in 2001 that he considered the sport a type of philosophy that he has practiced his entire adult life.\nLegal analyst Benjamin Wittes of Lawfare blog says that while there are lots of photos of Putin warming up and throwing opponents, they seem to be willing participants.\n\u201cPutin is fraud martial artist,\u201d Wittes wrote on Facebook. \u201cHe only fights people who are in his power, and they are all taking falls for him.\u201d\nMore: Putin's Russia: These are the candidates in an election some call a charade\nPutin used his martial arts prowess to earn good pay as a movie stuntman in the 1970s, according to a December report in the Russian Dozhd news site. \nPutin\u2019s judo buddies are really, really richSeveral members of Putin\u2019s Yawara-Neva judo club in St. Petersburg became extraordinarily wealthy or powerful since Putin rose to power. They include Putin\u2019s former sparring partner, Arkady Rotenberg, worth $3.1 billion, his brother Boris ($1.2 billion), oil trader Gennady Timchenko ($16.4 billion) and Vasily Shestakov. Shestakov, president of the International Sambo Federation who got his start as a judo trainer, is the only member who does not appear in the Forbes list of Russian billionaires.\nPutin\u2019s dissertation included 'extensive plagiarism'Putin in 1996 earned a post-graduate degree that is a rough equivalent of a\u00a0Ph.D. at the St. Petersburg Mining Institute, though he never attended that school, according to a 2006 presentation by analysts Igor Danchenko and Clifford Gaddy at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, D.C.\nLike this topic?

Putin denied the allegations, which Litvinenko wrote in\u00a0a 2001 book Blowing Up Russia.\u00a0The bombings provided the rationale for a military campaign in Chechnya that\u00a0coincided with Putin's first run for the presidency.\nPutin's war\u00a0in Chechnya employed a scorched-earth policy that left\u00a0thousands of dead Chechens.\u00a0Human rights violations were exposed by Russian reporter Anna Politkovskaya.\nSeveral of his critics and opponents died in brutal waysPolitkovskaya was shot to death at the entrance to her apartment building in Moscow in October 2006.\u00a0Litvinenko was poisoned to death in London with a rare radioactive isotope, polonium-210, the next month.\u00a0At least three other people who investigated or worked to expose their findings about the apartment bombings were murdered.\u00a0And opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot to death in 2015,\u00a0while strolling near the Kremlin with his girlfriend after dinner.\nMore: Mysterious rash of Russian deaths casts suspicion on Vladimir Putin\nTwice married, two daughtersPutin married his first wife,\u00a0flight attendant Lyudmila, in 1983, while he worked for the KGB.

That included the 39 visits from police, his reputation as a danger to students and an FBI report he was a possible school shooter.\n\"'And yet, he was never put on the list to be denied the ability to buy a gun, and his guns were never removed from him,\" he said.\nThis story will be updated.\n.@FLGovScott to require 21 y/o minimum age to purchase firearms\n\u2014 Nada Hassanein (@nhassanein_) February 23, 2018\n\n\n.@FLGovScott - \"I want to make it virtually impossible for anyone who has mental issues to use a gun\" - proposes threefold plan: gun laws, school safety, mental health\n\u2014 Nada Hassanein (@nhassanein_) February 23, 2018\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2GEFWgz", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/02/23/florida-gov-rick-scott-plans-make-illegal-own-gun-under-age-21-following-parkland-school-shooting/367182002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Eliza Collins", "body": "CLOSE\n\n\n\n\n\n    Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory in the very close special Congressional election in Pennsylvania.

Puskar, AP)\n\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrat Conor Lamb held a narrow lead in the special election for Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District but you wouldn\u2019t know it talking to Republican lawmakers Wednesday. Their message, coming from GOP leadership, was that Lamb ran as such a moderate, he was basically a Republican.\u00a0\n\u201cBoth candidates ran as pro-life, pro-gun and anti-Pelosi,\u201d Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., who previously chaired the House\u2019s political arm, the National Republican Congressional Committee told reporters. He added that the primary process\u00a0 \u2014 which can pull candidates to the extremes in any party\u00a0 \u2014 would make it difficult to replicate candidates such as Lamb.\n\u201cThe reason they call them special elections is because they\u2019re special, and I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it,\u201d he said.\nBut some outspoken Republicans say the potential loss \u2014 in a district Trump won by 20 points in 2016 \u2014 shows\u00a0the party needs to get prepared for high levels of anti-Trump enthusiasm that will put normally safe GOP seats into play.\n\u201cDenial is not just a river in Egypt;\u00a0this is a real problem\u201d said Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, a centrist Republican who will be retiring at the end of his term and has had no problem criticizing his party.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a Republican in a safe seat you better be ready ...\u00a0certainly the members in the marginal swing districts, they\u2019re well-prepared for the fight, they know what they\u2019re in for.\u00a0But I worry about members who have never been in a real fight before.\u201d\nWith all of the\u00a0absentee ballots counted, Lamb held a 627-vote lead out\u00a0of more than 224,000 cast, according to unofficial results.\nAn unknown number of provisional ballots have yet to be counted, and the four counties in the Pittsburgh area district have seven days to finish that task.\n\"If there\u2019s a single Republican candidate in anywhere in the country who thinks that they\u2019re going to be running in a favorable environment they\u2019re sorely mistaken,\" said Josh Holmes, a GOP strategist and former chief of staff to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. But, Holmes added, Republicans could still win. They just have to run strong candidates and campaigns.\u00a0\nWith the outcome of the race still officially in doubt, Lamb claimed victory during the night in a race with implications for November midterm elections.\nLamb, 33, a Marine veteran and former federal prosecutor,\u00a0told an exuberant crowd of supporters that\u00a0voters had directed him to \u201cdo your job\u201d in Washington. \u201cMission accepted,\u201d he declared.\nIn an interview with MSNBC on Wednesday morning, Lamb credited \"just good old-fashioned hard work\" for his claimed victory.\nEarlier, Saccone, 60,\u00a0an Air Force veteran who worked in counterintelligence,\u00a0told his own supporters, \u201cIt\u2019s not over yet. We\u2019re going to fight all the way, all the way to the end.\u00a0We\u2019ll never give up.\u201d\nA source familiar with GOP thinking who was not authorized to talk about Saccone's strategy Wednesday said Republicans were preparing to petition for a recount. Because the race is not statewide, no automatic recount will be triggered even if Lamb's lead is just a fraction of a point.\u00a0\nEven though it hasn't been called, the tight race already has national implications.\nDemocrats have said a win in this district \u2014 or even a narrow loss \u2014 means they can compete anywhere by capitalizing on Trump\u2019s unpopularity and high levels of anti-Trump enthusiasm.\n\u201cThese results should terrify Republicans,\" Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, D-N.M., said. \"There are more than 100 districts more favorable for Democrats than this one, and we look forward to competing hard in every single one.\"\nDemocrats must flip 24 GOP-held seats this fall to seize control of the House, and months ago few had counted on this\u00a0district to be in play. The seat has been in Republican hands for the past 15 years.\nThe Pennsylvania seat was open\u00a0because longtime Republican congressman Tim Murphy, who espoused strong anti-abortion views, resigned last fall amid revelations of an extramarital affair in which he urged his mistress to get an abortion.\nLamb pitched himself as an average guy from the mostly white, working class district. Frequently clad in jeans and beat-up work boots at campaign events, he talked about the economy and jobs, focusing his outreach on veterans and union members.\nHe supported gun rights and opposed abortion though said he would not vote to restrict access, called for new leadership in his own party in Washington and avoided criticizing the president \u2014 whose popularity is 10 points higher in the district than it is nationally, according to Monmouth University polls out this month.\nLamb\u00a0told MSNBC that during the campaign\u00a0he\u00a0kept hearing the same thing:\u00a0\"Work with the other side, do\u00a0what you say you are going to do.\"\n\"They\u00a0don't want us to shut down the government, or posture or bicker, but to figure things out,\" he said.\nDespite\u00a0backing from the president,\u00a0Saccone struggled to raise money and stir the same passions that helped Trump on his way to the White House. The consistent fundraising deficit left him with limited resources to air the message he delivered one on one: His four decades of experience in the private sector, international business and now the legislature should make voters\u2019 choice a no-brainer.\nIn many ways the race for this\u00a0seat is as much about bragging rights\u00a0as\u00a0raw political power\u00a0since the ultimate winner will face re-election in just eight months. In addition, the district, as currently drawn, will disappear next year thanks to a court-ordered redrawing of the state\u2019s district maps.\nThe race, in the end, was also a test of the parties ability to appeal to white, working-class voters.\nMore: Pennsylvania election will be seen as a bellwether for November\nMore: Pennsylvania special election between Rick Saccone and Conor Lamb too close to call\n\u00a0\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2FENXBT", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/14/conor-lamb-holds-razor-thin-lead-over-rick-saccone-closely-watched-pennsylvania-race/423247002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Trevor Hughes", "body": "Russian President and presidential candidate Vladimir Putin exits a polling booth as he prepares to cast his ballot during Russia's presidential election in Moscow on March 18, 2018.(Photo: Yuri Kadobnov, AP)\n\n\nLongtime Russian President Vladimir Putin headed toward easy re-election Sunday as authorities pressured citizens to vote in overwhelming numbers, offering giveaways and prizes\u00a0at the polls.\nCasting his ballot in Moscow, Putin reflected on his expected victory for another six-year term: \"The program that I propose for the country is the right one,\" he said.\nRussian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was barred from running against Putin, said\u00a0he boycotted the election and advised\u00a0other Russians to do the same.\nNavalny was prevented from being a candidate after\u00a0a criminal conviction widely viewed as politically motivated. He urged supporters not to vote because of the absence of any real competition, despite seven other names on the ballot.\nNavalny posted a video on YouTube, saying that \u201con election day, one should usually want to say \u2018I voted,\u2019 but in fact I\u2019m here to say that I didn\u2019t go to vote.\u201d\nGiven the lack of real competition, authorities struggled\u00a0against voter apathy, and pushed\u00a0for a strong voter turnout from Russia\u2019s nearly 111 million voters.\nPutin has been president or prime minister since December 1999, making him the only leader that a generation of Russians have ever known, and the longest-serving leader since former Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.\nPutin's re-election comes amid\u00a0rising tension with the West, particularly with the United Kingdom, which last week accused Russia of using a nerve agent to poison a former spy and his daughter living in England. In addition, U.S. federal prosecutors are investigating whether Russian-linked groups interfered during the 2016 presidential election.\nRussia's\u00a0election monitors reported irregularities at voting stations across country, even though authorities were under orders to ensure that the voting was free and fair after violations marred Putin's last election in 2012. Putin had faced a serious opposition movement then\u00a0but has since boosted his popularity with Russia's\u00a0actions in Ukraine and Syria.\u00a0\nPeople cast their ballots at a polling station in Yelizovo, Russian Far East, Russia, on March. 18, 2018.\u00a0(Photo: Alexander Petrov, AP)\n\nThe English-language Moscow Times newspaper marked the election with a series of stories on young people it\u00a0dubbed \u201cGeneration P,\u201d highlighting some of the 1.3 million people born the year Putin first became president.\nPutin was first named president in late 1999 after the resignation of Boris Yeltsin\u00a0and was elected to two terms. In 2008 he was replaced by Dmitry Medvedev, who named him prime minister, and then Putin was again elected president in 2012.\nMembers of a local election commission prepare a polling station ahead of Russia's presidential election in Simferopol, Crimea.

Voters also faced billboards celebrating Russian greatness \u2014 a major theme of Putin's leadership.\nPutin has traveled across Russia pledging to raise wages, pour more funds into the country's crumbling health care and education and modernize dilapidated infrastructure.\nYevgeny Roizman, the mayor of Russia's fourth-largest city, Yekaterinburg, told rhe Associated Press that local officials and state employees have all received orders \"from higher up\" to make sure the presidential vote turnout is over 60%. \n\"They are using everything: schools, kindergartens, hospitals \u2014 the battle for the turnout is unprecedented,\" said Roizman, one of the rare opposition politicians to hold a significant elected office.\nAuthorities also appealed\u00a0to patriotic feelings by holding the vote on the anniversary of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Polls show that most Russians see the takeover of that Black Sea peninsula as a major achievement despite subsequent Western sanctions.\nTurnout-boosting efforts have been the most visible feature of the campaign. In Moscow, authorities spent $870,000 on balloons and\u00a0decorations at polling stations. In Moscow, first-time voters were given free tickets for pop concerts, and health authorities offered free cancer screenings at selected polling stations. In the southern city of Tambov, the state-sponsored Youth Parliament backed an Instagram competition. Voters who took selfies at polling stations could enter a raffle for high-end electronics, including an iPhone X.\nContributing: The Associated Press\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2GEZkee", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/18/putin-headed-easy-re-election-russias-presidential-race-6-more-years/436129002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kevin Johnson", "body": "Share This Story!Let friends in your social network know what you are reading about'The United States is under attack': Intelligence chief Dan Coats says Putin targeting 2018 electionsThe 'U.S. is under attack,' and Russian President Putin is targeting 2018 elections, the director of national intelligence said Tuesday.Posted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

It said in a statement that it does\u00a0not use, hold or have access to Facebook data or data from other social media platforms.\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO, said the social network had \"made mistakes\" over the scandal. \"I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I'm responsible for what happens on our platform,\" he said in a Facebook post Wednesday.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat is Cambridge Analytica and who owns it?\u00a0Cambridge Analytica is the elections division of SCL. It has more than a\u00a0dozen branches and offices around the world linked through a complex corporate structure with multiple shareholders.\u00a0\n\"When you try to wind SCL back and figure out where it came from, and how it got to where it is now it's very difficult to do,\" said\u00a0Martin Moore, director of the Center for the Study of Media, Communication and Power at King's College London.\u00a0\nSCL, founded in 1993\u00a0by former\u00a0Saatchi  Saatchi advertising executive Nigel Oakes, has\u00a0operated\u00a0at least 18 separate companies in Britain and 12 in the United States, according to corporate filings in Britain and the United States\u00a0compiled by Wendy Siegelman, an independent researcher in New York, and verified by USA TODAY.

Ted Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign paid Cambridge Analytica nearly $6 million for work before the company went to work for Trump, the records show.\nIn most instances SCL and Cambridge Analytica won't divulge who pays for its work. But case studies published on its website show\u00a0the scope and\u00a0complexity of SCL projects.\u00a0\nIn Afghanistan, SCL undertook\u00a0\"audience profiling\" to understand local attitudes toward religious affairs and governance.In Kenya, Cambridge Analytica has taken credit for helping to re-elect\u00a0President Uhuru Kenyatta, a vote marred by\u00a0concerns over its legitimacy.\u00a0In Mexico, it used commercial and political data to gauge\u00a0the impact of United States\u00a0policy on the drug trade and violent crime in 13 cities under the influence of drug cartels.In Nepal, it gathered data\u00a0on anti-social behavior among Maoist insurgents.In Somalia, it assessed the viability of establishing a telephone network across the war-torn country.\"I call (SCL) information mercenaries. They go wherever there is something to be done,\" said Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a Switzerland-based mathematician who studies and campaigns for issues related to data protection and privacy through his organization PersonalData.IO.\nDehaye has filed freedom of information requests in Britain\u00a0to determine how Cambridge Analytica collects its data and whether that data extraction\u00a0violates British law.\n\"There's no doubt they have been trying to manipulate data for their purposes,\" said\u00a0David Miller, a professor of sociology at Bath University, in England, and an authority on propaganda.\n\"It's not clear how good they are at doing it,\" Miller said.\u00a0\"The difficulty in understanding this organization is that a lot of what it says about itself turns out not to be to quite right.\"\nWhat role did Cambridge Analytica play in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections?The Facebook case is lifting the veil on some of Cambridge Analytica's actions and tactics.\nThe social media platform, which suspended Cambridge Analytica\u00a0from\u00a0its platform on Friday,\u00a0said the data analytics firm improperly received, used and then held onto user data passed to it by Cambridge University psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan.\nKogan, Facebook claims,\u00a0devised and then exploited a personality predictor application to get unsuspecting Facebook users to give away information about themselves and their Facebook friends.\nThe app Kogan created, \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" was downloaded only 270,000 times, but was able to connect to other data points, such as 'likes' and hometowns, for millions of other Facebook users through the\u00a0app users' network of friends and family.\nHe then passed the information to Cambridge Analytica for Trump's campaign.\u00a0\u00a0\nFacebook has since changed its privacy policies to prevent such connections.\nKogan told USA TODAY late last year that he had \"very limited knowledge\" of Cambridge Analytica's activities. He did not return a request\u00a0for comment on the Facebook allegations or to further explain his side of the story.\u00a0\nIn an emailed reply to USA TODAY questions, Cambridge Analytica said\u00a0it\u00a0provided research, data science\u00a0and digital and TV marketing services for Trump's campaign. The company said it used\u00a0polling, voter files, early and absentee voting returns released by each state, and both its own and Trump campaign data to compile over 5,000 data points on 230 million American voters. The company said it\u00a0did not use \"marketing psychology\" to target Trump supporters.\u00a0\nGary Coby, director of advertising at the Republican National Committee and a top media strategist on the Trump election campaign, said Cambridge Analytica was on the ground with the Trump social media team, sharing San Antonio, Texas, office space\u00a0with other Trump media execs, in the months leading up to the 2016 presidential election.\n\"They had a lot of great people, really smart people,\"\u00a0he said.\nBut Coby downplayed the firm\u2019s role in Trump\u2019s victory.\u00a0\n\"They helped on some surveying, some of the data sides, had multiple ad buying teams under me,\" Coby\u00a0said.\nThe campaign, as a whole, focused more on direct-response marketing \u2013 or getting voters to donate or volunteer immediately after seeing an ad \u2014\u00a0rather than \u201cpsychographic targeting,\u201d he said. \"Psychographic targeting\" uses data points to create personality profiles of American voters that can then be reached with more targeted political advertising, a tactic\u00a0Cambridge Analytica claims as a\u00a0specialty.\u00a0\nAround the time Cambridge Analytica began\u00a0work\u00a0for Trump,\u00a0Nix, the company's CEO,\u00a0reached out, via a public-speaking agency,\u00a0to Julian Assange, the founder of the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks, seeking information about 33,000 missing emails belonging to candidate Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton.\nCambridge Analytica said through a spokesperson who declined to be named that Nix made the approach to WikiLeaks to find what information it had and where it came from. The official said the company was not asked by the Trump campaign or anyone else, including Russia, to make the inquiry.\nAssange in a tweet confirmed the approach from Nix, but said Wikileaks never acted on the request.\u00a0\nIn October and November of 2016, Wikileaks published thousands of emails allegedly stolen from Clinton's campaign boss John Podesta by Russian-linked hackers.\nLast December, the House Intelligence Committee, which had been probing Russia's interference in the U.S. presidential election, called on Nix to testify behind closed doors.\nOn Tuesday, in a video broadcast on Britain's Channel 4, Nix is  of the committee, saying Republican members asked him just three questions. \"After five minutes \u2014\u00a0done,\" he said.\u00a0\nContributing: Rick Jervis reported from Austin, Tex.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2FWtGMa", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/03/22/cambridge-analytica-profile/437210002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Preet Bharara", "body": "Preet Bharara and Christine Todd Whitman, Opinion contributors\n            Published 12:01 a.m. ET Jan. 29, 2018 | Updated 4:28 p.m. ET Jan. 29, 2018CLOSE\n    Plagued by historically low public approval numbers and the firestorm of the Russia probe, President Donald Trump will look to celebrate his successes and reset his term Tuesday night with his first official State of the Union address.

We're launching a bipartisan project to mend the gaps in our system and make sure our government is competent and trustworthy.George Washington addressing the constitutional convention, 1856 painting by Junius Brutus Stearns(Photo: AP/Virginia Museum of Fine Arts)One year into the Trump presidency, it\u2019s clear that the norms and boundaries traditionally guiding American political behavior have deeply eroded. That matters greatly. A workable democracy can thrive only when there are basic rules, often unwritten, that curb abuse and guide policymakers. Though the two of us are\u00a0from different political parties, we both believe that\u00a0now\u00a0is the time to ensure the president and all our public officials adhere to basic rules of the road. It\u2019s time to turn soft norms into hard law.So far, President Trump has refused to divorce himself from his business interests, despite decades of tradition. He has repeatedly tried to influence federal criminal investigations. Policymaking processes have become haphazard. And we now see worrisome attacks on the independent press. All this shows just how easily a chief executive can ignore the unwritten rules that typically constrain presidents. We see similar erosion elsewhere in government, too. For example, a major tax bill, affecting the whole economy, enacted with no committee hearings.\u00a0More: Short of impeachment, 6 ways Congress can limit Trump damage to AmericaMore: Trump's not being defamed. If he was, he wouldn't need to change the libel laws.Trump is extreme, but he is not the first president to breach core constitutional norms. Our system relies on checks and balances, constitutional commands that are implicit in our founding document but often not spelled out with specificity. Everyone in the political process must act as if limited by invisible guardrails to avoid abuse of power. But at moments of stress or executive impudence, what was assumed to be a solid restriction on improper conduct turns out to be flimsy, relying too much on goodwill or unspoken understandings. When that happens, reform often follows scandal and controversy.\u00a0\u00a0Today, we\u2019re launching an independent democracy task force\u00a0at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's School of Law to holistically review these informal rules, which ones should remain guidelines, and perhaps which ones should be enshrined into law. We\u2019ll examine norms surrounding financial conflicts, political interference with law enforcement, the use of government data and science, the appointment of public officials\u00a0and any other issues that may arise in the coming months. We will be joined by experts and former officials from both parties. The goal is to issue a set of recommendations, policies that can be enacted that mend the gaps in our system and ensure we have a government that functions ably, competently and with the trust of the American people.\u00a0That\u2019s how Americans have responded in other instances when norms have been breached.\u00a0For example, George Washington\u2019s decision to limit himself to two terms seemed like as solid a precedent as ever existed in American political life. Then Franklin D.\u00a0Roosevelt ran for and won a third and then a fourth term, and we amended the Constitution to enshrine the two-term norm. After John F. Kennedy appointed his brother to lead the Justice Department, Congress passed an anti-nepotism law.Richard Nixon\u2019s many abuses, of course, led to a wide array of new laws, ranging from the special prosecutor law (now expired), to the Budget and Impoundment Control Act and the War Powers Act. Some of these were enacted after he left office. But others, such as the federal campaign finance law, were passed while he was still serving, with broad bipartisan support, over his veto.More: Trump's 'stable genius' reality check: America, this isn't a drillPOLICING THE USA:\u00a0A\u00a0look at\u00a0race, justice, mediaSo it\u2019s not too early to begin mapping out needed change. The longer we wait, the more damage our system will sustain. Public confidence in our institutions is plummeting, and with an ever-quickening news cycle that turns on every tweet, we have to take on these challenges in short order.Of course, we undertake this effort in a hyperpolarized and partisan political environment. But we believe, perhaps with more idealism than is merited, that there is a strong underlying consensus in both parties around these norms. There is ample precedent for bipartisan majorities to strengthen institutions in the wake of scandal, controversy or abuse. It\u2019s also why we\u2019re recruiting task force members from inside and outside government, Republicans and Democrats and independents, to join us.Already some leaders \u2014\u00a0at least outside Washington \u2014\u00a0are having these conversations. Legislators in Massachusetts and California have proposed bills that would require the disclosure of tax returns to appear on the state\u2019s presidential election ballots (though California Gov.\u00a0Jerry Brown vetoed one of those attempts). While we may not agree with their proposed solutions, the fact that states \u2014\u00a0our laboratories for democracy \u2014\u00a0are beginning to generate their own debates about norms gives us hope that there\u2019s room to have these discussions on a national level.It\u2019s not enough to read news stories \u2014\u00a0or tweets \u2014\u00a0and fret. Our system is facing a challenge it has not faced in decades. These norms of liberal democracy are being pummeled around the world, as well. At a moment like this, perhaps it is a good thing to break the norm of partisanship.\u00a0Preet Bharara, a scholar in residence at the NYU School of Law, was U.

He criticized Trump's moves to isolate the U.S. from other global powers. And he decried the revolving door of staffers who\u00a0have sullied the reputation of the White House on their way out the door.\"The character of the guy and the (turnover) and fighting, and just the constant chaos around his presidency that is self-inflicted has made it hard for him,\" Bush said. \"I want the president to succeed. I don't think think he will succeed if he continues on this path.\"Bush blamed both political parties when sizing up the ongoing battle\u00a0over immigration. The White House on Thursday released a plan that provides a path to U.S. citizenship for up to 1.8 million undocumented DREAMers in exchange for $25 billion to help build a border wall and a nearly 25% reduction in legal immigration.The proposal was immediately panned by Democrats opposed to reducing legal immigration so drastically and many Republicans opposed to granting citizenship.The two sides have until Feb. 8 to strike a compromise, and Bush said both are placing possible political gains\u00a0above the real-life consequences facing the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants.\u00a0\"The left and the right have figured out that this is a great political wedge issue,\" Bush said. \"It's not a moral issue or an economic issue. It's purely an issue of, 'How do we poll this to make sure our\u00a0team, our tribe, does better?'\"Bush  Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., for not taking a leading role to help both sides find a\u00a0middle ground. Rubio, another failed presidential candidate in 2016, was\u00a0part of a bipartisan group of senators\u00a0that pushed\u00a0an immigration overhaul\u00a0through the Senate in 2013, but he has been largely silent during the current debate.\"God forbid you actually took on something that was controversial and paid a political price,\" Bush said. \"That's the attitude in D.C. right now. Certainly Sen. Rubio is no different in that regard. Marco is a talented guy and he understands this issue really well, and maybe behind the scenes he's working hard. But at some point, his leadership would be really helpful.\"The former governor had high praise for one member of the Trump administration: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. He admitted\u00a0that he's biased since she used to be a board member on his education foundation. But Bush said she's struck the right balance between supporting school choice principles and keeping the Washington bureaucracy out of classrooms.\u00a0\"She a phenomenal advocate,\" he said.As for his own political future, Bush was\u00a0non-committal.\u00a0He said the political environment in Washington has become so toxic that he has no interest in jumping back into another presidential race. \"Until that changes, I don't anticipate running for anything,\" he said.Bush, 64, said he'd rather continue focusing on his work, his education foundation, candidates that he supports, and his golf game.\"I got a blessed life,\" Bush said. \"I got four grandkids.

Here's a closer look at what that label means.\n    USA TODAY NETWORKAttorney General Jeff Sessions(Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images)WASHINGTON \u2013 The Justice Department is threatening 23 so-called sanctuary cities, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, with subpoenas if they fail to provide documents to show whether local law enforcement officers are sharing information with federal immigration authorities.The demand, outlined Wednesday by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, represents a new escalation by the Trump administration to punish local jurisdictions that do not fully comply with federal immigration enforcement efforts, including by sharing the immigration status of local prisoners.The subpoena threat comes as Congress prepares to restart talks on revamping the\u00a0immigration system, days after lawmakers' failure to reach an agreement on the politically-charged issue led to a three-day government shutdown.\u00a0More: Trump trumpets win on short-term spending deal, but shutdown politics remainSessions has made it one of his top priorities to crack down on sanctuary cities, a term that describes more than 300 local governments that have limited their cooperation with federal immigration officials.Last year, Sessions threatened to withhold millions of dollars of federal assistance if local governments could not prove that they were cooperating with federal authorities.\"I continue to urge all jurisdictions under review to reconsider policies that place the safety of their communities and their residents at risk,\" Sessions said Wednesday in a written statement.\u00a0\u00a0\"Protecting criminal aliens from federal immigration authorities defies common sense and undermines the rule of law.\"The administration's move will likely be challenged by cities and immigration advocates,\u00a0as federal courts in California and Illinois last year blocked the administration's efforts to withhold federal public safety aid from cities. Chicago officials argued in September that penalizing cities \u2013 withholding funds to support local public safety efforts for shielding undocumented immigrants was unlawful and unconstitutional.\"The harm to the city's relationship with the immigrant community if it should accede to the conditions is irreparable,\" U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber said then in a 41-page decision, siding with the city of\u00a0Chicago.Justice officials, however, believe that cities' receipt of the grant funds is contingent on their compliance with federal law that promotes such information sharing on immigration matters. The department says\u00a0that local police are required to inform federal authorities before undocumented immigrants are released from custody and allow federal access to local jails.The latest Trump administration actions identifies 23 of those governments, including the states of California, Oregon and Illinois. They claim that local policies do not encourage cooperation with federal immigration authorities.\u00a0For the local and state governments, the stakes are high. Chicago, for example, received more than $2 million in grants last year, which it used to buy police department vehicles and support non-profit groups working in high-crime neighborhoods.The communities have argued that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility and that the U.S. Constitution prohibits Washington from forcing them to assist.More: 'Victory for the American people': S.F. attorney lauds blocking of Trump sanctuary cities orderMore: Trump's crackdown on 'sanctuary cities' blocked nationwideMore: Legal victory for 'sanctuary cities' only the beginning of long immigration battleRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2rACmB8", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/24/justice-department-threatens-sanctuary-cities-subpoenas-escalating-trumps-immigration-enforcement-ca/1061225001/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jason Harrow", "body": "Jason Harrow, Opinion contributor\n            Published 5:00 a.m. ET March 8, 2018\n        \nThere's no legal justification for states\u2019 use of winner-take-all.

So of course it\u2019s legal, they conclude.\nMore: How states can fix the Electoral College and prevent future Trumps\nMore: Let's fix the Electoral College. It'll be easy compared to gerrymandering\nBut longstanding practice or tradition doesn\u2019t by itself make something legal. The Supreme Court famously reaffirmed this in its recent decision that states could not continue to define marriage as between one man and one woman just because that\u2019s the way it had always been defined.\nMoreover, the winner-take-all system is not required by the Constitution. Instead, the Constitution leaves the choice of allocation of presidential electors up to each state, but that choice is subject to the \u201cone person, one vote\u201d requirement of the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.\nMy organization, Equal Citizens, is working with a bipartisan team of lawyers that filed legal challenges to the winner-take-all system last month in four states \u2014 California, Massachusetts, Texas and South Carolina. Equal Citizens also ran a crowd-funding campaign to support the project and developed the legal theories underlying the lawsuits.\nThe challenge for winner-take-all\u2019s defenders\u00a0is\u00a0serious. If we take away the \u201cwe\u2019ve always done it that way\u201d argument (doesn\u2019t matter legally), the \u201cit\u2019s in the Constitution\u201d argument (winner-take-all\u2019s not in there) and the \u201cstates can choose presidential electors however they want\u201d argument (they can\u2019t, because they need to comply with \u201cone person, one vote\u201d), then the foundation for our current system starts to look less stable. In fact, our system crumbles.\nIt turns out there is no argument that can legally justify states\u2019 use of winner-take-all to allocate electors. It\u2019s an unconstitutional way to pick the presidential electors who ultimately cast votes for president and vice\u00a0president.\nThat conclusion may seem stunning, but it\u2019s actually a straightforward application of a principle of fairness and equality of citizenship that has been in our Constitution since the Equal Protection Clause was added following the Civil War.\nTo see why, it\u2019s important to remember that voters don\u2019t actually cast votes for president but instead vote for slates of presidential electors expected to support that candidate with a vote in the Electoral College. For example, in 2016, California was entitled to choose 55 presidential electors, and, because Hillary Clinton got more votes than any other candidate in the state, California used winner-take-all to select 55 Democratic presidential electors who would all cast votes for Clinton for president.\nDonald Trump managed to get over 4.5 million votes in California,\u00a0more than in any state he won except for Texas and Florida,\u00a0but they were tossed out. Trump\u2019s 4.5 million popular votes translated into zero presidential electors.\nMore: We're so divided we're helping our enemies. Independents like us can fix this.\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at\u00a0race, justice, media\nThis violates the Constitution\u2019s principle that all votes matter equally. Imagine if California got rid of its 40 state Senate districts and instead asked voters to simply vote for a Democratic or Republican majority leader. And then imagine that instead of allocating the 40 senators to match the two parties'\u00a0share of the\u00a0vote, the state gave the winning party all 40\u00a0state Senate seats. So the Senate would always be 40-0 in favor of one party.\nThis winner-take-all scheme for electing state senators would be illegal, because it violates one person, one vote. A state can\u2019t turn a contested election for multiple seats into a 40-0 blowout. This principle applies in selecting presidential electors as much as it does for state senators.\nSome might dismiss the analogy by saying that the winner-take-all state Senate scenario is a ridiculous hypothetical. After all, no state has anything like it, and it seems absurd. But that\u2019s exactly the point: Using a winner-take-all system to choose the members of a multi-member body is so plainly unfair and unconstitutional that no state would dream of implementing it for most of its state offices. And yet 48 states currently have just such a system for selecting presidential electors. It must be put to an end.\nJason Harrow is chief counsel for Equal Citizens, a non-profit working to end states\u2019 use of winner-take-all in the Electoral College.\n\u00a0\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2oWIJtW", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/03/08/winner-take-all-presidential-system-unconstitutional-court-challenge-jason-harrow-column/398742002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Ledyard King", "body": "CLOSE\n\n\n\n\n\n    Hurricane Maria was the strongest when it made landfall in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico.

Kelly said the reports, pulled last week from the IG's web site,\u00a0didn't meet proper standards for a government audit.\n\"We\u00a0were not confident that the evidence collected (in those reports) was necessary to support the conclusion,\" Kelly said in an interview Thursday. \"It doesn't mean the conclusion was wrong (but) our standard is that it has to be adequately supported. You can't say something without having the evidence even if it's true.\"\nThe Federal Emergency Management Administration, or FEMA, is a division of the Department of Homeland Security.\nInstead of initial reports, the agency will adopt a model that provides \"real-time feedback\" to FEMA about its response to disasters\u00a0based on observations on the ground rather than reviews that come out months after a recovery begins, Arlen Morales, a spokeswoman for the IG's office wrote in an email.\u00a0\n\"This work does not lend itself well to a traditional audit following Government Auditing Standards.\u00a0 Nevertheless, the work is critically important,\" she wrote. \"By following standards that better suit the work, we can better accomplish the objective of the work\u2014\u00a0namely, to provide timely feedback to FEMA on issues before they become multi-million dollar problems.\"\nThe change means the watchdog won't be issuing a public assessment of FEMA's preliminary efforts to help Puerto Rico recover from Hurricane Maria, a devastating, category 4 storm that left much of the island without power and other basic necessities\u00a0for months.\nNearly 200,000 families and businesses in Puerto Rico \u2014\u00a016% of the U.S. territory \u2014\u00a0remain without power.\u00a0The island faces a growing mental health crisis as people wrestle with their losses from the\u00a0storm.

Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, said the federal response to last year's hurricanes that hit Texas (Harvey) and Florida (Irma) was robust and immediate.\nThe Trump administration's response to Maria \"was far slower and smaller,\" he said during a committee hearing Thursday examining federal efforts to help communities recover from last year's disasters.\n\"Even weeks after the storm, there were only a fraction\u00a0 of the federal personnel on the ground (compared to Texas and Florida),\" Thompson said. \"Food and water were in short supply, and federal contracts to provide essentials like tarps and meals were botched, further slowing the response.\"\nNot since 2005 when Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and killed nearly 2,000 along the Gulf Coast has FEMA been under such a public microscope.\nThose defending FEMA's response to Maria say the agency, already juggling several other major disasters last summer,\u00a0had to respond to a remote area whose substandard infrastructure and government corruption severely complicated rescue and recovery.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"The bottom line is my agency made a herculean effort to put food and water in every area,\" FEMA Administrator Brock Long told the House committee Thursday. \"And it's not going to move as fast when you're talking about island jurisdiction and airport systems ... and ports (that) are completely blown out.\"\nBrock Long is administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\u00a0(Photo: Deborah Barfield Berry, USA TODAY)\n\nMorales, the spokeswoman for the IG's office, said the new approach will work better than traditional audits.\n\"Our disaster deployment work was always meant to provide FEMA with real-time response,\" she said. \"We believe our new approach will improve our ability to do that.\"\nCraig Fugate, who ran FEMA under President Obama from 2009 to 2017,\u00a0said the new approach could be more beneficial than the after-the-fact \"punitive reports\" the IG often issues in the wake of a disaster.\n\"If they're moving to where (they give FEMA) a chance to address those (problems)\u00a0as they see them, particularly in the disaster environments, that would be helpful,\" he said in an interview last week.\nBut Claire Rubin, an independent disaster\u00a0researcher and consultant, said not having\u00a0initial reports means researchers and first responders won't be able to thoroughly measure FEMA's response to specific disasters.\nThe recovery from Hurricane Sandy in 2012, for example, was enhanced by the lessons learned from Katrina, she said.\n\"We learn from history,\" said Rubin, who runs the Recovery Diva\u00a0blog. \"Those of us who watch recovery know it's going to be decades for it\u00a0to unfold.

Prison officials have repeatedly contended that all\u00a0employees are regarded as \"correctional workers first.\" Indeed, all staffers are provided basic officer training as a condition of employment, but few civilians have been required to put that training into practice before they are tapped to plug security gaps.\"We continue to hire\u00a0staff at institutions around the country as needed to further the mission of the Bureau of Prisons,\" the agency said in a statement.Nearly two years ago, USA TODAY reported that nurses, physical therapists and other medical staffers had been pressed into security duties, raising concerns about their safety. The report was followed by a memo from then-acting Director Thomas Kane urging restraint in authorizing such deployments, directing wardens to use it \"only as a last resort.\"Yet the practice has only continued \u2013 and even accelerated \u2013 at some short-staffed institutions.The Federal Correctional Institution, Tallahassee a low security federal correctional institution with a detention center.\u00a0(Photo: Bop.gov)Two months after Kane's June 2016\u00a0memo,\u00a0the warden overseeing federal prison operations in Hazelton, W.Va., said officer shortages there required civilian employees to pull officer shifts in inmate cell blocks and as substitutes for officers on vehicle patrols.\u00a0\"Current staffing levels at...Hazelton have made it difficult to fill mandatory posts on a regular basis without relying on augmentation,\" Warden Joe Coakley said in the\u00a0Aug. 1, 2016 memo.There also are growing concerns that the level of risk\u00a0to both staffers and inmates will only increase, as the Trump administration is in the midst of\u00a0cutting about 6,000 positions from its force \u2013 about a 14% reduction system-wide. The cuts include about 1,800 officer positions.While the BOP said the majority of the positions being eliminated are currently vacant, the moves \u2013 including plans to transfer an undisclosed number of inmates to private contract prisons \u2013 has roiled the ranks where some work schedules vary from day to day.A sampling of prison work rosters at the Coleman, Fla., complex obtained by\u00a0USA TODAY showed that up to 36 civilian staffers were assigned to guard duty on any given day last year. Their numbers included teachers, laundry workers, financial managers and a \"religious service\" staffer.At the federal prison complex in Victorville, Calif., John Kostelnik, chief of the local prison workers union, said up to 60 civilian staffers a day have been assigned to officer posts.\"We have people who have literally never done this before,\" he said. \"It's quite scary. The whole system of (civilian reassignments) is a mess.\"The United States Penitentiary, Victorville, Calif. \u00a0(Photo: bop.gov)Laurie Robinson, a former assistant attorney general who was part of a congressional task force that examined the federal prison system in 2015, said that the safety and security of inmates and \"requires making sure that the people are trained for the duties that they are carrying out.\"\"For this (civilian reassignments) to be occurring as a matter of course is not a good thing,\" Robinson continued. \"This goes against sound corrections practice.\"A string of recent decisions issued by federal labor officials in Colorado, South Carolina and Kansas strongly support the deep concerns being raised across the system.In November, the Federal Labor Relations Authority ruled in favor of re-assigned staffers at the Bennettsville, S.C., Federal Correctional Institute, referring in part to a \"lack of adequate training\" that posed \"increasing inherent risk\" to the facility.As part of a successful challenge to conditions in Florence, Colo., announced in December, a prison staffer testified that when recreation workers were reassigned to officer duty \u2013 leaving recreation\u00a0areas with less supervision \u2013 \"an inmate was assaulted in the gym and there was an attempted murder in the paint room.\"\"Inmates notified these employees that they wait until staff are pulled...to assault other inmates because they know there will be less coverage,\" the staffer testified.Eric Young, president of the union representing prison workers, said that at least \"hundreds\" of such reassignments have been made in the past year across the system's 122 facilities.\"The problems have only escalated,\" Young said. \"Some of the facilities are making these assignments everyday to avoid paying overtime to corrections officers.\"Young said he met with new BOP Director Mark Inch in December to discuss the conditions.\"Teachers are hired to teach \u2013 not to be corrections officers,\" Young said. \"You can't have your cake and eat it, too.\"The United States Penitentiary, Hazelton, W.V. \u00a0(Photo: bop.gov)Despite the ongoing cuts, the BOP said actual staffing will remain largely the same because most of the eliminated positions were already vacant. A larger re-organization of the system is slated to continue, as the overall prison population has declined in recent years. Though over-crowding in a number of facilities persists. \u00a0\"At this point, we aren't reducing staffing levels,\" the agency said. \"We are eliminating positions, but not staff.\"\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, the cuts have prompted a vocal lashing from union officials.\"With less corrections officers in the prisons, BOP has turned to augmentation...which means that cooks, foremen, secretaries, electricians, teachers, accountants or counselors are augmented to replace officers inside the prison,\" American Federation of Government Employees president David Cox said.\u00a0\"Augmentation can result in one correctional worker supervising hundreds of dangerous prisoners, including terrorists, gangs and murderers inside each facility with no backup.\"Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2o26T5O", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/13/ill-equipped-and-inexperienced-hundreds-civilian-staffers-assigned-guard-duties-federal-prison-secur/316616002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Suedeen Kelly", "body": "Suedeen Kelly, Opinion contributor\n            Published 5:00 a.m. ET March 22, 2018\n        \nForeign hackers are effectively sitting in our power supply rooms.

But neither of those things are necessary to cause major economic damage, social unrest and threats to public health and safety.\u00a0In reality, taking out a dozen large power plants in key locations across the country could hamstring our electric grid for days, weeks or even longer depending on the damage done. \u00a0\nAnd that is something the U.S. public rightly fears. In\u00a0a survey this month sponsored by Protect Our Power, a group of professionals\u00a0focused on strengthening the grid, 66%\u00a0of respondents said they are unprepared for an extended power outage, and 67% said they would anticipate significant financial or quality-of-life damage in the event of an extended outage.\nMore: Will new Facebook scandal finally force tech CEOs to testify to Congress?\nMore: Election hacking is going to happen.

It followed similar recent warnings, including a confidential report last June about a narrower set of activities aimed at the U.S. nuclear, energy and manufacturing sectors, although none has been as specific as the March 15 alert.\nThe most frightening issue is that the prior warnings do not appear to be creating a sense of urgency in Congress, at the federal agencies that exercise regulatory control over the electricity supply, or among the utility companies that\u00a0own and operate the electric grid.\u00a0To be fair, activity is taking place, but at a pace that does not appear to match the escalating threat we face right now. \u00a0\nThe Homeland Security department said months ago that the campaign is ongoing and hackers are actively pursuing the long-term objective of being able to access and manipulate computer networks inside the electric industry.\u00a0It now appears that they have achieved at least partial success, and done so relatively quickly. \u00a0\nThis raises two key questions: What is next from the hackers? And what do we need to do to stop them?\nA relatively simple but highly effective way to damage industries and handicap the U.S. economy would be to manipulate or control our power grid \u2014\u00a0the vast, highly inter-connected network of power plants, wires, poles and transformers that deliver electricity to homes, businesses and critical service providers every day.\u00a0Puerto Rico stands as a painful illustration of the damage and chaos inflicted by being without power for an extended period of time.\nMore: GOP's crazy Russia probe conspiracies are crushed in Fusion GPS transcript\nPOLICING THE USA:\u00a0A look at\u00a0race, justice, media\nThe complexity of how the grid is operated and regulated presents real challenges when trying to take significant steps forward in cyber security.\u00a0But it is clear from polling that the American public understands the need for coordination across agencies and entities, and expects the government to be a leader in getting the relevant parties on the same page and urgently taking concrete steps to secure the grid \u2014\u00a0now. \u00a0\nAbsent cohesive, focused leadership and funding, scatter-shot grid upgrades will likely only achieve limited success.\u00a0On the upside, advanced technology is making grid improvements easier than ever before.\u00a0What we now need to establish is a large-scale public-private partnership that brings together the necessary expertise and financing to support making the grid more impenetrable as quickly as possible.\nInvesting in the grid pays extra dividends by ensuring resilience in other key infrastructure areas being targeted by cyber-attacks \u2014\u00a0the nuclear, water, aviation\u00a0and manufacturing sectors \u2014\u00a0all of which require a reliable supply of electricity to perform their critical functions in society.\nBeginning today, with foreign entities effectively sitting in our power supply control rooms, it must become a national imperative to: Identify exactly where grid improvements and upgrades are needed;\u00a0develop a collective national plan to drive key short- and long-term grid improvements; implement whatever regulatory reform are necessary to ensure that our bulk power system can repel the threats we face; and, identify the public and private funding mechanisms, including the potential use of tax-exempt government bonds, to fund these critical improvements and protect our national security and welfare.\nWe should not keep kicking this can down the road.

For now, I hope Democrats win Congress in 2018.Republicans once believed in limited government, fiscal restraint, support for the defense and national security establishments, family values, and a strong American role in maintaining global order. More than that, we were the party that believed in logic and prudence over emotion. Our hearts were perhaps too cold, but never bleeding.Today\u2019s Republicans, however, are a party of bellowing drama queens whose elected representatives blow up spending caps, bust the deficit, and attack America\u2019s law enforcement and national security agencies as dangerous conspirators. Their leader expects banana republic parades, coddles the Kremlin, protects violent men in positions of responsibility, and overlooks child molestation. The rank-and-file GOP members who once claimed that liberals were creating a tyrannical monarchy in the Oval Office now applaud the expansion of the presidency into a gigantic cult of personality.So, am I still a Republican?More: Team Trump men's club: Accused of mistreating women? You're hired.More: Let Trump military parade pass us byI get asked this question a lot since coming out as a Never Trump Republican during\u00a0the 2016 campaign. When it comes from Democrats, it\u2019s almost always a question asked in bad faith, as they want me either to quit my party or to answer for all of its current (and past) sins. When asked \u201chow could you stay in your party\u201d by people whose party has plenty to answer for itself,\u00a0including the nomination of Hillary Clinton,\u00a0it\u2019s not a productive conversation.However, Republicans themselves (and not just the Never Trump variety)\u00a0are having the same conversations, privately and publicly. Is President Trump now the avatar of the Republican Party, and if he is, how can anyone who once believed in the party of Lincoln and Reagan stay in it?For a time, I actually dropped my GOP voter registration after the disgusting spectacle of the 2012 primaries, where Newt Gingrich was taken seriously as a possible president while extremists in a debate audience shocked even Ron Paul by yelling \"Yeah!\"\u00a0when he was asked about an uninsured young man in a coma\u00a0and whether \"society should just let him die.\u201dIt didn\u2019t feel right. I am a conservative who joined the GOP in 1978; I had worked for a Republican in the Senate; I was still voting for Mitt Romney; I wanted the GOP to make gains in Congress in 2014. I may have been disgusted by the behavior of some Republican voters, but I was still attached to the Republican Party. I was, in a strange way, an Independent In Name Only.As the likelihood of a Trump victory grew, I felt even more strongly attached to the Republicans because I wanted to prevent my party from being hijacked by a callous and vulgar life-long Democrat for whom party politics were just an extension of his own strange emotional needs, and who cared nothing for conservative ideas or values.When Trump won, I stayed, because I believed that his victory was an aberration, a bizarre outcome that resulted from several factors, including Clinton\u2019s impossibly inept campaign. There would come a day when Trump was gone, and reasonable conservatives would have to pick up the pieces and recreate the GOP as a functioning center-right party rather than as a vehicle for an ongoing series of inane populist keggers.But for now, I really am a Republican In Name Only, because I actively want to see the Republicans defeated \u2014 soundly \u2014 in 2018 (and in 2020, if the president is not primaried out of his seat). Where I was once unaffiliated but quietly cheering on conservatives, I am now a member of a party I want to see cast into the political wilderness for a few years \u2014 or longer, if that\u2019s what it takes to break the fever.In terms of party loyalty, that makes me a pretty lousy Republican. On the other hand, I might argue that I am in fact a better Republican than the opportunists on the White House staff and Capitol Hill who have left the party but refuse to give up the name.The same could be said for \u201cRepublican\u201d voters. Do they really represent the party, or are they The Coalition of the Incoherent? Like the president himself, they have no political compass, no policy preferences, and no attachment to anything that cannot be expressed in a bumper sticker. Indeed, what seems to unite Trump voters is a generic hostility to immigrants and a demand that government resources and transfers not be shrunk but redirected \u2014 to themselves.Many of them, of course, actually voted for Back\u00a0Obama. (If these Obama-to-Trump voters are \u201cRepublicans,\u201d then the term has no meaning at all.) I have argued that these voters are better understood not as \u201cRepublicans,\u201d but more generally as \u201cwhite welfare-statists\u201d whose party affiliation is up for bids every four years.I\u2019m also taking a gamble based on history. Populism looks powerful from the outside, but it rarely succeeds in holding power. It is not a belief\u00a0but a reflex, one that fades away once the hard work of governing looms. It\u2019s a great vessel for expressing anger. It\u2019s not very good at keeping the lights on and delivering the mail.With all of that said, what could finally drive me from the party? If going to the wall for deficits, wife-beaters, mall creepers\u00a0and Vladimir Putin isn\u2019t enough, what is? And how much longer can this go on before the Trump administration damages the words \u201cRepublican\u201d and \u201cconservative\u201d permanently?My answer is to see whether\u00a0enough of my fellow conservatives agree with me in 2018 to accept that the party needs to be purged of the New Know-Nothings. Perhaps Republicans like me need a new name: I am not a \u201cNever Trumper\u201d so much as I am a \u201cRepublican in exile,\u201d as I wait for an end to the occupation of the party by people who never cared about its history or beliefs.More: Are Trump voters ruining America for all of us?: Tom NicholsPOLICING THE USA:\u00a0A\u00a0look at race, justice, mediaOf course, no one should underestimate the ability of the Democrats to screw up an election, and it\u2019s possible that the midterms and the 2020 election will end up breaking for Trump\u2019s GOP. If that happens, the Republican Party has no future. I and many others, including younger people, will leave, and the GOP will become largely a regional party, confined to islands of older white voters in the South, the Rust Belt\u00a0and the mountain states who will be gone in 30 years and who will take the GOP with them.At that point, some other party \u2014 not a \u201cthird way\u201d but a new conservative party \u2014 will have to take the GOP\u2019s place. That process will take decades, and I will not live to see it. And so I\u2019d prefer to revive the GOP after it is forced back into the minority, when we can have a real fight within the party about what it stands for and who it should support by reforming the Republican National Committee, the primary process\u00a0and the platform.The GOP needs to be returned to its foundations in conservative ideas instead of left to drift in mindless rage and willful ignorance. It does not need to be abandoned, nor does it need to be burned to the ground. But it definitely needs to be temporarily evacuated and fumigated.And so, for the near future, the GOP losing is the only way to win. I\u2019ll stay for now, because I believe in a loyal opposition \u2014 even if it has to be within my own party.Tom Nichols, a\u00a0professor of national security affairs at the Naval War College,\u00a0is the author of\u00a0The Death of Expertise.

Rand Paul blocked the bill from passing before a midnight deadline, forcing a partial government shutdown.The\u00a0deal \u2014\u00a0negotiated by congressional leaders and released late Wednesday night \u2014hit a glitch when Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., demanded\u00a0a vote on restoring the strict 2011 budget caps that limited congressional spending.Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to allow the vote and Paul would not back down.Paul's right to object will elapse at 1 a.m., and the Senate will proceed to vote on the measure, which includes short-term federal funding through March 23. But federal funding from the last short term spending bill expires at midnight.If the Senate approves it, the 652-page budget bill\u00a0would then go to the House, where it faces stiff\u00a0opposition from liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans.\u00a0That budget agreement would eliminate the budget caps \u2014 set in 2011 to reduce the federal deficit \u2014 paving the way for Congress to increase defense spending by $165 billion and hike domestic spending by $131 billion over the next two years.The measure is stuffed with other fiscal\u00a0provisions, including a\u00a0major disaster relief package for regions hard-hit by last year\u2019s devastating storms and a one-year\u00a0suspension of\u00a0the debt limit,\u00a0the amount the U.S. Treasury can borrow to pay the nation's bills.\u00a0President Trump offered a full-throated endorsement of the deal in a Wednesday evening tweet,\u00a0saying \"Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill.\"McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer of New York have both championed the agreement as a bipartisan breakthrough that would end the destabilizing cycle of short-term spending bills that lawmakers have had to pass repeatedly\u00a0to keep the\u00a0lights on at\u00a0government agencies.\u00a0\u00a0\"No one would suggest it's perfect, but we worked hard to find common ground and stay focused on serving the American people,\u201d McConnell said Wednesday.\u00a0With backing from the two Senate leaders, the bill is expected to win bipartisan support in that chamber. But its fate in the House remains unclear, with both Democrats and Republicans facing internal party divisions over the deal.\u00a0Defense hawks and moderate Republicans said it's a strong compromise that will provide a much-needed boost to the military.\"If you vote no,\u00a0you\u2019re voting against fixing the military,\" Rep. William \"Mac\"\u00a0Thornberry, R-Tx.,\u00a0chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday.\u00a0But conservatives called it a budget-busting proposal that would further sink the country in a sea of red ink. \u00a0\"It's a plus-up on everything,\" said Rep.

And on Friday, the association urged its members to lobby against legislation in Maryland because it \"lacks basic due process protections and is ripe for abuse.\"\n\"The NRA fought red flag laws for years,\u201d said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety. \u201cIf they\u2019re serious about supporting them now, they\u2019ll signal as much to their lobbyists in the 22 states where red flag bills are currently pending.\"\nSen.

Among them:\n\u2014\u00a0Criminal penalties for those who bring \u201cfalse or frivolous\u201d charges.\n\u2014\u00a0A determination by a judge, by \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d that the person poses a significant risk of danger.\n\u2014\u00a0A requirement that a judge determine whether the person meets the standard for involuntary commitment.\n\u2014\u00a0If the order is granted, the individual should receive community-based mental health treatment.\n\u201cTo be effective and constitutional, they should have strong due process protections and require that the person get treatment,\u201d Cox says in the video.\nRead more: Some officials wanted Florida school shooting suspect forcibly committed in 2016\nHouse passes school safety bill as students protest inaction on gun violence\nBaker, the NRA spokeswoman, couldn\u2019t point to a federal or state bill that the organization supports, but she said, \u201cWe\u2019re confident that there will be a bill introduced that provides adequate due process while ensuring that people who are a danger to themselves or others don\u2019t have access to firearms.\u201d\nThe NRA statements\u00a0coincide\u00a0with student protests across the country against congressional inaction on gun violence. Last Wednesday, thousands of students staged \u201cNational Walkout Day\u201d events, marking the one-month anniversary of the shooting deaths of 17 students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The accused gunman, Nikolas Cruz, was long-known to law enforcement as troubled.\n\u201cMy observation here is that the man did everything but take an ad out in the paper, \u2018I'm going to kill somebody,\u2019\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said at a Wednesday Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.\nAfter the shooting, Florida became the sixth state to pass a red flag law. (The NRA sued the state of Florida to block part of the law but didn't take a position on the red flag provision.) Several other states introduced versions of \u201cred flag\u201d bills in response to the shooting.\nPresident Trump, as part of his response to the shooting, called on all states to adopt extreme risk protection orders and directed the Department of Justice to provide technical assistance to states that want to implement the orders.\nIn Congress, other bills are pending and some are forthcoming.\nA House bill would give states incentives to allow family members or law enforcement to get court orders to temporarily stop dangerous individuals from purchasing or possessing a gun. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., sponsored the Senate version of the bill\u00a0\u2013 and took Cox\u2019s statement as a sign of support.\n\u201cNow there can be no excuse from Republicans to oppose our legislation,\u201d she said in a statement.\nHowever, Baker said Feinstein\u2019s bill doesn\u2019t offer \u201cmeaningful due process,\u201d uses a low evidentiary standard and doesn\u2019t require the individual seek treatment.\nGraham and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., proposed legislation to create an extreme risk protection order process for federal court.\u00a0Baker said their bill is\u00a0\u201cnot workable.\u201d The NRA opposes efforts to create a federal law tasking federal agents with seizing firearms in federal court, according to the YouTube post.\nBlumenthal said federal law is critical to ensure protection through a national safety net, since many states won't adopt red flag laws \"over gun lobby opposition.\"\u00a0\n\u201cThe NRA wants a Catch-22: oppose a federal statute, supposedly relying on the states, and then oppose state laws, as it has consistently done,\" Blumenthal said.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2FML9qv", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/19/under-pressure-nra-voices-support-gun-violence-restraining-orders/433716002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Susan Page", "body": "Susan Page and Marilyn Icsman, USA TODAY\n            Published 11:11 a.m. ET Feb. 25, 2018\n        \nStudents, parents and others at the federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Feb. 17 call for gun control legislation.(Photo: Nicole Raucheisen/Naples Daily News)\n\n\nWASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Americans overwhelmingly support tougher gun laws, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds, but they also overwhelmingly agree on this: Congress isn't likely to act anytime soon.\nIn the wake of another deadly school shooting, this time in Florida, the disconnect between public opinion and predictions of legislative inaction is sharp.\u00a0Advocates of gun control and others wonder if the outcry sparked by students who survived the shooting spree at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland\u00a0might shake the political calculations that have stymied significant new limits on guns for decades.\nIn contrast, some in corporate America \u2014 from airlines to car rental companies \u2014 moved over the weekend to break ties with the National Rifle Association, the powerful D.C. lobby that has stood against the most far-reaching proposed gun laws.\u00a0The NRA called their action \"a shameful display of political and civic cowardice.\"\n\"Right now it's a joke,\" said Greg Silva, 64, a retired electrical engineer from Reno, Nev., who was among those called in the poll. \"If a person wants a gun they can go to a gun show and pass no checks. That's ludicrous.\" Licensed dealers at gun shows are required to conduct background checks, but private sellers are not.\nAs President Trump sends mixed signals about what he'll support when it comes to gun legislation, his approval rating has fallen to its lowest level in the USA TODAY survey since he was inaugurated last year. Just 38% now approve of the job he's doing as president; 60% disapprove.\nThat's a steep drop from the president's standing one year ago, in March 2017, soon after his first address to Congress had received good reviews. Then, 47% expressed approval, a high-water mark for him in the poll; 44% expressed disapproval.\nWhat's more, the intensity of feeling is hardening against the president. Now, the percentage who \"strongly disapprove\" of him is more than double the percentage who \"strongly approve,\" 39% compared with 16%.\nA new CNN poll released Sunday put Trump's approval rating at 35%, his\u00a0lowest level in that survey.\nThe USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll of 1,000 registered voters nationwide, taken Tuesday through Saturday, has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.\nOn guns, a nation that is often divided on issues is remarkably united:\u00a0\nBy almost 2-1, 61%-33%, they say tightening gun-control laws and backgrounds checks would prevent more mass shootings in the United States.By more than 2-1, 63%-29%, they say semi-automatic weapons like the AR-15, used by the Florida shooter, should be banned.By more than 6-1, 76%-12%, they say people who have been treated for mental illness should be banned from owning a firearm.Even gun owners are inclined to support those three measures. But a majority of Republicans say tighter gun laws wouldn't prevent more mass shootings, and they oppose banning semi-automatic weapons.\u00a0\nRepublicans are more likely than Democrats to support a ban on firearms for those who have been treated for mental illness, a proposal also backed overwhelmingly by Democrats and independents.\u00a0\n\"Everyone who commits a mass shooting has a mental issue,\" says John Shaw, 60, of Madison, Wisconsin. \"Preventing them from getting the gun is the most important thing.\"\nDespite the consensus on some measures, few expect Congress to toughen gun-control laws in the foreseeable future. Fewer than one in five, 19%, say the odds are excellent or good. More than three in four; 76%, rate them as fair or poor.\nRepublicans are more likely than Democrats to predict Congress will act, 28% compared with 14%.\nMore: Florida school shooting: Broward sheriff probes claim that more deputies did not immediately enter school\nNRA hits back at United Airlines, Delta, other companies for cutting ties\nArmed with an AR-15, military veteran keeps watch on Indiana high school\nThere is a partisan divide on whether restricting access to guns or improving mental health care would do more to curb mass shootings. By a wide margin, Republicans and gun owners say improving mental health care would do more. Democrats and those who don't have guns in their household are inclined to say restricting access to guns would do more.\u00a0\nOverall, 39% say improving mental health care would do more; 31% say restricting access to guns would; 25% say both.\u00a0\nThere is bipartisan agreement on strengthening security at schools. By 58%-32%, those surveyed say schools should be required to have an armed police officer on site. By 62%-27%, they say schools should be required to have metal detectors at their doors.\nInterestingly, younger adults were less likely than older ones to back those ideas, although a majority in both groups supported them. Among those 50 and older, 69% support\u00a0metal detectors, for instance, compared with 53% of those under 35 years old.\u00a0\nLike this topic?

And the timing for a final vote in that chamber remained unclear.If the Senate approves the measure, the 652-page budget bill\u00a0would then go to the House, where it faces stiff\u00a0opposition from liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans.\u00a0That budget agreement would eliminate strict budget caps\u00a0set in 2011 to reduce the federal deficit \u2014 paving the way for Congress to increase defense spending by $165 billion and hike domestic spending by $131 billion over the next two years.The measure is stuffed with other fiscal\u00a0provisions, including a\u00a0major disaster relief package for regions hard-hit by last year\u2019s devastating storms and a one-year\u00a0suspension of\u00a0the debt limit,\u00a0the amount the U.S. Treasury can borrow to pay the nation's bills.\u00a0President Trump offered a full-throated endorsement of the deal in a Wednesday evening tweet,\u00a0saying \"Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill.\"Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky\u00a0and Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer of New York have both championed the agreement as a bipartisan breakthrough that would end the destabilizing cycle of short-term spending bills that lawmakers have had to pass repeatedly\u00a0to keep the\u00a0lights on at\u00a0government agencies.\u00a0\u00a0\"No one would suggest it's perfect, but we worked hard to find common ground and stay focused on serving the American people,\u201d McConnell said Wednesday.\u00a0With backing from the two Senate leaders, the bill is expected to win bipartisan support in that chamber. But its fate in the House remains unclear, with both Democrats and Republicans facing internal party divisions over the deal.\u00a0Defense hawks and moderate Republicans said it's a strong compromise that will provide a much-needed boost to the military.\"If you vote no,\u00a0you\u2019re voting against fixing the military,\" Rep. William \"Mac\"\u00a0Thornberry, R-Tx.,\u00a0chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday.\u00a0But conservatives called it a budget-busting proposal that would further sink the country in a sea of red ink. \u00a0\"It's a plus-up on everything,\" said Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., a member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus. \"It's a Christmas tree on steroids.\"\u00a0Democrats are also conflicted because while the deal would\u00a0increase\u00a0spending for their favored domestic programs, the agreement does\u00a0nothing to protect the DREAMers, the undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.House Democratic leader Nancy\u00a0Pelosi delivered a record-breaking 8-hour speech on the House floor Wednesday, telling the stories of DREAMers\u00a0without\u00a0a break\u00a0to\u00a0object to the budget plan's failure to protect those immigrants.\u00a0If conservative Republicans in the House oppose the agreement, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.,\u00a0will need a significant number of Democratic votes to get it passed. It's not clear how many\u00a0House Democrats will follow Pelosi's lead and oppose it.Lawmakers face an imminent\u00a0deadline. Current federal funding runs out at midnight on Thursday, and if Congress does not pass a new spending bill, it will trigger a partial government shutdown.\u00a0The House on Tuesday passed its fifth stop-gap spending bill, a proposal that would fund domestic programs through March 23 and also\u00a0give the Pentagon a full-year budget of $659 billion. Democrats strongly oppose that measure because they say it short shrifts domestic spending.The Senate is expected\u00a0to\u00a0vote on and reject that House-passed bill Thursday,\u00a0then move to replace that short-term bill with the broader budget agreement.If it passes, it would give Congress six weeks to craft a spending bill for\u00a0the rest of 2018 that meets the new budget targets before the government\u00a0runs out of money again.Contributing: Michael Collins and Nicole GaudianoRead\u00a0more:\u00a0Senate leaders unveil sweeping budget deal; House may still reject itNancy Pelosi told DREAMer stories for more than 8 hours on the House floor\u00a0\u00a0Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2nM1EIo", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/08/senate-poised-approve-massive-two-year-budget-deal-setting-up-fight-house/318278002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "William Cummings", "body": "CLOSE\n\n\n\n\n\n    Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was fired on Twitter by President Trump after a 14-month tenure.\n    USA TODAY\n\n\n\nEach week, USA TODAY's OnPolitics blog takes a look at how media from the left and the right reacted to a political news story, giving liberals and conservatives a peek into the other's media bubble.\nThis week commentators from the left and the right reacted to the news that President Trump unceremoniously fired his secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, via Twitter.

Feeling ignored, put-upon, and mistreated, state secessionists want to take their fate into their own hands.\u00a0\nAt present, there\u2019s little prospect of adding stars to the American flag, but these movements do indicate a widespread sense of dissatisfaction among (mostly rural) populations who feel that they are governed by people in distant urban centers who know little, and care less, about their way of life. Their complaints, in many ways, sound like the complaints of Americans circa 1775.\nIntrastate secession isn't exactly new in the United States: West Virginia was once part of Virginia, for example, and Tennessee was once part of North Carolina, though that evolution was less fraught. But in recent years we've seen a number of states facing calls to split, from inhabitants of regions who feel effectively unrepresented.\nMore: Florida shooting yet another government failure to keep us safe: Glenn Reynolds\nMore: Hollywood, ESPN and other debacles: Why can't our ruling class do its job?\nIn New York State, for example, there have been repeated calls to split\u00a0upstate New York from the New York City region. One such proposal involves letting the NYC area keep the name \"New York,\" while the new upstate state would be named \"New Amsterdam.\" The reason? \"We're completely overwhelmed ... by the policies of New York City,\" according to New York State Senator Joseph\u00a0Robach.\u00a0The idea has been circulating for over 25 years, but now seems to be gaining some degree of additional support.\nPerhaps better-publicized is Silicon Valley entrepreneur Tim Draper\u2019s plan\u00a0to split California into six states, one of which would be, essentially, Silicon Valley\u2019s own preserve.\u00a0Though Draper\u2019s plan did not make the 2016 ballot, it served as a useful outlet for complaints about unrepresented parts of the state.\nSome such effort might also please the residents of inland and northern California, who feel that California state government \u2014\u00a0with its heavy interests in the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas \u2014\u00a0views them with indifference or even hostility. Writing in the\u00a0Los Angeles Daily News,\u00a0demographer Joel Kotkin compared these neglected, poverty-stricken regions of California to apartheid-era South Africa\u2019s \u201cbantustans,\u201d\u00a0observing that inland California has high unemployment, poor healthcare, and a general sense of being despised and neglected by the coastal high-rollers running the state.\nSomewhat less ambitious than Draper\u2019s is a plan to split the wealthy, coastal regions of California from the remainder, leaving the state of \u201cNew California\u201d to be made up of most of the state\u2019s rural areas. As CBS News reports,\u00a0\u201cunlike other separation movements in the past, the state of New California wants to do things by the book, citing Article 4, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution and working with the state legislature to get it done, similar to the way West Virginia was formed. ...\u00a0The group is organized with committees and a council of county representatives, but say it will take 10 to 18 months before they are ready to fully engage with the state legislature.\u201d\u00a0The goal is to let the rural areas govern themselves in ways more suited to their needs, while the wealthy coastal regions do the same. (The New California movement already has chapters in 34\u00a0counties, according to its website.)\nA similar dynamic obtains in Washington State,\u00a0where some legislators are reviving a proposal, dating back to 1915, to separate Eastern Washington into its own state, provisionally named \u201cLiberty,\u201d and in Oregon, where activists in the eastern part of the state want to secede\u00a0from coastal Oregon, either to set up their own state, or to join the existing state of Idaho,\u00a0with which they feel they have more in common. (There\u2019s also a plan to join Eastern Washington and Eastern Oregon into a new state called \"Cascadia.\")\nMore: We're so divided we're helping our enemies. Independents like us can fix this.\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at\u00a0race, justice, media\nThere\u2019s even talk about splitting downstate Illinois\u00a0away from Chicagoland. Once again, the downstate hinterland contains a lot of people (but, despite their much greater geographic extent, fewer than the Chicago metro area) who feel unrepresented, and believe that Chicago\u2019s dominance of the state causes downstate tax dollars to flow toward politicians\u2019 vote-buying efforts in Chicago, while Chicago voters impose regulations that downstate citizens don\u2019t want.\nSplitting a state is hard. West Virginia managed because the existing Virginia legislature was in rebellion against the United States, making it easy\u00a0for President Lincoln and the Congress to recognize the new rump legislature put together in Wheeling as the \u201cofficial\u201d legislature of Virginia, and accepting its approval (which the Constitution requires) for forming a new state out of part of the old Virginia. Such circumstances aren\u2019t likely\u00a0today, let us hope, though if states like Illinois or California went bankrupt, they might agree to a split in exchange for a federal bailout.\nBut short of that, is there anything Congress can do? I think so. As I argue in a recent paper,\u00a0most of the state-secessionist complaints have to do with urban areas applying the heavy hand of government regulation to rural people with different needs: Overstrict environmental laws, labor laws, firearms laws\u00a0and the like. \u00a0\nFederal law governs all of these areas, but generally allows states to regulate more strictly if they so desire. I suggest that federal law be changed to pre-empt state laws in the same area, making federal regulation not just a floor, but a ceiling by preventing states from adopting stricter rules.\u00a0(In some cases, this could even be done by administrative regulation). \u00a0\u00a0\nSome might argue that such a move infringes on states\u2019 rights, but the federal government has traditionally stepped in to protect local minorities from being oppressed by local majorities. That\u2019s what the Civil Rights Act did, for example. Using federal power to promote greater freedom seems in keeping with our traditions and values.\nPerhaps Congress will get on this. Or perhaps the state of \u201cNew California\u201d will one day be a reality.\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of\u00a0The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

Burr said the panel will work with the Senate Appropriations Committee to secure more funding for states.\nAt a minimum, senators said, any new machine that states buy should have a voter-verified paper trail and no WiFi capability that can be hacked.\n\"Russians cannot hack a piece of paper the way they can a computer system connected to the Internet,\" said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.\nStates must be in the leadThe senators emphasized that states \"should remain firmly in the lead on running elections, and the federal government should ensure they receive the necessary resources and information.\" States have bristled at any suggestion that the federal government infringe on their traditional role in running elections.\nThe committee also said there is a need for improved information-sharing about cyber attacks among the federal government, states and local governments. Senators said the U.S. intelligence agencies should work to declassify information quickly, whenever possible, so they can warn state and local officials about attacks.\nThe Department of Homeland Security should work closely with election experts to\u00a0create voluntary cybersecurity guidelines and a public awareness campaign to promote election security awareness, working through the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, the National Association of Secretaries of State, and the National Association of State Election Directors, the committee recommended.\nSenators said homeland security officials must also work to reduce the amount of time that states have to wait for help with cybersecurity.\nThe election security recommendations are the first action taken by the committee as part of its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. The panel, which began its probe in January 2017, plans to come out with further reports in the weeks ahead.\n\"We're now at a point where we've wrapped up one piece of our investigation\u00a0which deals with election security,\" Burr said.\nSenators on the committee wanted to issue their election security recommendations this month, which kicks off the congressional primary election season. Texas\u00a0held its primary earlier this month, and Illinois was holding its election Tuesday.\nCongress has so far done little\u00a0in response to\u00a0last year's reports from the Department of Homeland Security that Russian hackers tried to breach election systems in\u00a021 states in 2016.\u00a0Although no actual votes were changed, hackers\u00a0broke into Illinois' voter registration database.\nDemocrats\u00a0\u2014 and some Republicans\u00a0\u2014 have been pushing to boost funding for FBI counterterrorism teams and grants to states\u00a0to protect against Russian meddling in this year's elections.\nThe Senate committee's bipartisanship stands in stark contrast to the House Intelligence Committee, which has been plagued by bitter partisan division during its year-long Russia investigation.\nRepublicans on the House committee called an end last week to their year-long investigation of Russian meddling, concluding that there was \"no evidence of collusion, coordination, or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians.\" The probe was ended over the objections of Democrats, who charged that key documents and testimony still have not been obtained.\nHouse vote set for ThursdayThe House panel is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to make the Republican report public, after it is reviewed by intelligence agencies to ensure that no classified information is released. Democrats are continuing their own investigation and plan to write a separate report.\nThe congressional actions come amid increased criticism by President Trump about special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, which is being done on behalf of the Department of Justice. Mueller is probing Russian interference in the 2016 election, possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, and possible obstruction of justice by the president. Trump has lashed out directly at Mueller's prosecution team in recent days, prompting concerns that the president may try to fire the special counsel.\nSen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and other prominent Republicans \u2014 along with Democrats \u2014 have warned Trump against taking any action against Mueller, saying it would prompt a constitutional crisis.

Trey Gowdy (R-SC) questions Attorney General Jeff Sessions during his appearance before the House Judiciary Committee.(Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY)WASHINGTON\u2014Forget running for re-election. House Republicans are running for the exits instead.On Wednesday, Rep. Trey Gowdy\u2014chairman of the powerful House Oversight Committee\u2014became the third GOP lawmaker in just the last week to announce plans to leave Congress at the end of this term.All told, 41 Republican House members have said they will either retire or seek another office, compared to 16 Democrats, according to the House Press Gallery. Some of those lawmakers have been forced out amid sexual harassment allegations, while others are running for governor or the Senate.But at least nine are influential committee chairmen who, like Gowdy, are leaving with no scandal afoot. So what\u2019s pushing these gavel-wielding lawmakers out the House door?A toxic stew of congressional dysfunction, perilous electoral prospects, term limits on committee chairmen, and an increasingly rightward tilting party with a president widely see as erratic\u00a0at its helm.\u201cWashington\u2019s not a very pleasant place for anybody,\u201d said former Rep. Tom Davis, a Virginia Republican who retired in 2008 after 14 years in the House. \u201cThe polarization and all the gamesmanship\u201d can be grinding, Davis said, and the rewards aren\u2019t very sweet these days. \u00a0\u201cThe public hates you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t get re-elected, but you\u2019re not getting great outcomes.\u201dJust look at Congress\u2019 legislative plate right now: a spending standoff that threatens a second government shutdown in a matter of weeks, an explosive immigration debate with no clear solution, and a presidential infrastructure proposal that appears dead on arrival. \u00a0Another helping, anyone?\u201cThere is a time to come and a time to go,\u201d Gowdy tweeted on Wednesday. The former federal prosecutor from South Carolina said he wanted to leave politics and return to the justice system.\u201cWhatever skills I may have are better utilized in a courtroom than in Congress, and I enjoy our justice system more than our political system,\u201d he said in a statement.Gowdy\u2019s announcement came on the heels of two others:\u00a0Rep. Pat\u00a0Meehan said he would not run for re-election last week after news emerged that a former aide had accused him of sexual harassment. And on Monday, New Jersey Republican\u00a0Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen announced that he would also retire rather than seek another term\u00a0in November.\u00a0Frelinghuysen last year became chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, once considered the most powerful perch in Congress.Read more:House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy to retireReports: Rep. Patrick Meehan denies sexually harassing staffer he called a 'soul mate'GOP retirements boost Democrats' hopes for taking the House in 2018But with earmarks banned -- making it nearly impossible to bring home pet projects or use the promise of them as leverage in negotiations -- and spending bills mired in the legislative mud, the committee has lost some of its luster. And Frelinghuysen\u2019s decision was at least in part a nod to the electoral landscape.Democrats are hoping to ride a wave of anti-Trump anger\u00a0to regain the House majority in November. Frelinghuysen would have faced a tough re-election in his swing New Jersey district, where several Democrats were already lining up to challenge him.The party that controls the White House generally loses seats in the midterm elections, and several nonpartisan political analysts believe that President Trump\u2019s dismal approval ratings will be a significant added drag on Republican congressional candidates.David Wasserman, a political analyst with the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said a wave election may already be forming, giving lawmakers a heads up to get out of the way.\u201cIn past cycles when the House has changed parities, members haven\u2019t seen it coming until a couple months out,\u201d Wasserman said. \u201cThe difference is now Republicans have a choice between filing for re-election or retiring or running for other office. And many of them are deciding that it\u2019s not worth trying to ride this out.\u201dEven those in safe House seats aren\u2019t sure they want to stay in office if it means being in the minority, Wasserman said. In the House, the minority has almost no power to influence legislation or set the agenda.Davis agreed and said some Republicans have become \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with the party, as it has shifted rightward and now is led by Trump.\u201cThis is not the party that they grew up with,\u201d Davis\u00a0said. \u201cThe Republican base had kind of rotated from the country club to the country.\u201d\u00a0Jesse Hunt, a spokesman for the House Republican campaign committee, rejected the suggestion that Republicans were leaving because their party was about to be out of power.\u201cThe vast majority of retirements are term-limited chairmen who hail from deeply Republican districts,\u201d Hunt said.In the House, Republicans operate under rules that limit committee chairman to six years no matter how long they serve in Congress. Wasserman and others agree that dynamic is playing a role in driving even powerful and safely ensconced lawmakers out.\u201cMany members spend years in Congress climbing up the ranks to become a committee chair but if you\u2019re termed out after a couple cycles, you can suddenly find yourself with less power,\u201d said Wasserman. \u201cUpward mobility is essential to many members.\u201dDavis said that rule was imposed in the 1990s because committee chairman had become too powerful. But it inadvertently made congressional leaders too powerful, and the legislative process has suffered as a result.Add the gridlock and partisanship, Davis said, and the job just isn\u2019t appealing anymore.\u201cYou wait, sitting around all day, waiting for the deal and then I vote yes or no. That\u2019s it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I left.

(March 9)\n    AP\n\n\n\nA South Korean soldier walks past a television screen showing pictures of President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at a railway station in Seoul.(Photo: JUNG YEON-JE, AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\nWASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 For President Trump and Kim Jong Un, the announcement of historic talks between the leaders of the United States and North Korea already has delivered something both of them crave: Global attention and respect.\nForeign policy veterans more accustomed to blasting Trump as a naif and a nationalist who has eroded U.S. leadership in the international institutions built\u00a0since World War II found themselves praising him, albeit often with caveats. Leon Panetta, who served in top jobs in the Clinton and Obama administrations, said on CNN that the world was \"breathing a sigh of relief\" at the idea of talks. Veteran diplomat Chris Hill, the chief U.S. negotiator in the last set of serious negotiations with Pyongyang, on MSNBC called the announcement \"extraordinary.\"\nAnd Kim, a global outlaw, finally has won what he has long sought \u2014\u00a0the prestige of a face-to-face meeting with the American president, and without making the most consequential concessions that previous administrations had\u00a0demanded.\nThe episode is\u00a0classic Trump, reflecting both his willingness to disrupt the accepted wisdom on how to proceed\u00a0and his confidence in his own ability to strike a deal where others have failed. It also reflects his comfort with chaos, delivering a bombshell on foreign policy at a time he also is scrambling party orthodoxy on economic policy and, by the way, facing a legal probe on Russian election meddling that seems to be accelerating toward a conclusion.\nAt least for the moment, the diplomatic jolt about Pyongyang overshadowed\u00a0concerns about whether Trump had started a trade war when he imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports Thursday, not to mention the potential legal complications of $130,000 in hush money his lawyer paid a porn star with the stage name of Stormy Daniels.\nFor a president who delights in bombshells, it may have been the biggest bombshell of them all.\u00a0\nMore: Trump agrees to first-ever meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un\nMore: North Korea: What could possibly go wrong when Trump meets Kim Jong Un?\nMore: North Korea-U.S. talks: Why make the offer now, what does North Korea want in return?\nWhen President Barack Obama met with President-elect Trump after his unexpected election in 2016, the outgoing president told the incoming one that North Korea would be the most urgent problem\u00a0he would face, and the threat from Pyongyang's nuclear program has only grown since then. Now North Korea has fired intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the U.S. mainland and tested what analysts believe was a hydrogen bomb.\nEfforts to rein in the nuclear program have failed, despite efforts by a series of presidents. During the Clinton administration, in 1994, North Korea signed an agreement to freeze its plutonium weapons program in exchange for aid, but then secretly pursued a uranium enrichment program anyway. During the George W. Bush administration, in 2005, Pyongyang promised to dismantle its nuclear program, another promise it didn't keep.\nDuring his tenure, Trump has used more threatening rhetoric than any of his predecessors, vowing \"fire and fury\" against a North Korea threat. Now he also is the first to agree to sit down with the North Korean leader. In exchange, Kim promised to stop nuclear and missile testing for now and to countenance the joint military drills in South Korea next month.\u00a0\u00a0\nSome analysts expressed concern about whether the Trump administration was ready for the talks that are now slated to follow this spring\u00a0without the meticulous preparations that marked previous rounds of negotiations, and without an experienced diplomatic team in place. The administration's top Korea expert resigned recently, and there is no U.S. ambassador in South Korea and no confirmed assistant secretary of State for Asia.\u00a0\nTrump, for one, doesn't seem concerned about that. \"I won't rule out direct talks with Kim Jong Un; I just won't,\" he said in\u00a0remarks at the Gridiron Dinner last weekend. He even joked about which leader was more challenging. \"As far as the risk of dealing with a madman is concerned,\" he said, \"that's his problem, not mine.\"\n\u00a0\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2G9VSIo", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/09/analysis-historic-north-korea-talks-both-trump-and-kim-get-something-they-crave/409844002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Doug Stanglin", "body": "President Trump waves as he walks from Marine One to board Air Force One, on Feb. 2, 2018, in Andrews Air Force Base, Md., en route to Palm Beach International Airport, in West Palm Beach, Fla.(Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP)President Trump tweeted Saturday that the controversial memo released by a House committee \"totally vindicates\" him in the Russian probe.The president's comment, made from his weekend retreat in Mar-a-Lago in Florida, did not indicate whether he planned to take any action to stop the investigation, which is being led by\u00a0special counsel Robert Mueller.This memo totally vindicates \u201cTrump\u201d in probe.

But in the era of Trump, Ginsburg, 84, is packing her schedule and sending signals she intends to keep her seat on the bench for years.The eldest Supreme Court justice has produced two of the court\u2019s four signed opinions so far this term. Outside of court, she\u2019s the subject of a new documentary that includes video of her working out. And she\u2019s hired law clerks to take her through June 2020, just four months before the next presidential election.Soaking in her late-in-life emergence as a liberal icon, she\u2019s using the court\u2019s monthlong break to embark on a speaking tour that is taking her from the Sundance Film Festival in Utah to law schools and synagogues on the East Coast. One talk will have her in Rhode Island on Tuesday, meaning she won\u2019t attend the president\u2019s State of the Union speech that night in Washington.She has a standard response for interviewers who ask how long she intends to serve. She will stay as long as she can go \u201cfull steam,\u201d she says, and she sees as her model John Paul Stevens, who stepped down as a justice in 2010 at age 90.\u201cI think that Justice Ginsburg has made clear that she has no intention of retiring. I am sure she wants to stay on the court until the end of the Trump presidency if she can,\u201d said Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at the University of California, Berkeley, and a liberal who called on Ginsburg to retire in 2014, when Barack Obama was president and Democrats controlled the Senate.But Chemerinsky noted \u201cno one can know whether she will be on the court on Jan. 20, 2021, if Trump serves one term, let alone Jan. 20, 2025, if he is re-elected.\u201dGinsburg doesn\u2019t talk about Trump in public anymore, not since she criticized him in interviews with The Associated Press and other media outlets before the 2016 election. The comments prompted Trump to tweet that \u201cHer mind is shot \u2014 resign!\u201d She later apologized.More: Squat, lift, kick, curl: Justice Ginsburg's workout is tough and it left me exhaustedMore: Sundance: Ruth Bader Ginsburg likes Kate McKinnon's 'SNL' impression and supports #MeTooGinsburg, who declined to comment for this story, this year marks the 25th anniversary of her nomination by President Bill Clinton and her confirmation as the second woman on the court.As Ginsburg and most Americans anticipated Hillary Clinton\u2019s election in 2016, she didn\u2019t commit to retiring but suggested she would give the first female president the chance to replace \u201ca flaming feminist litigator,\u201d as Ginsburg has wryly described herself.When her husband, Martin Ginsburg, died in 2010, Ginsburg said she did not think much about stepping down. If anything, since Stevens\u2019 retirement, she has become more outspoken and visible as the leader of the court\u2019s liberal wing.Two childhood friends from Brooklyn, New York, who retired two decades ago say \u201cKiki,\u201d the nickname they still use for Ginsburg, has kept the same busy schedule for years.\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s slowing down. That\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Ann Kittner, a friend since their days at James Madison High School. Harryette Helsel, who has known Ginsburg since kindergarten, said she\u2019s joked with Ginsburg: \u201cWe\u2019re retired. Why are you working so hard?\u201d They both laughed.Helsel pointed to Ginsburg\u2019s workout routine, which has been in the spotlight in recent years. Ginsburg started working out with a trainer in 1999 after being treated for colorectal cancer. She does an hour twice a week.A book on the workout by her trainer, with a forward by Ginsburg, came out last year. \u201cRBG,\u201d a documentary about the justice that premiered at Sundance, includes video of her doing pushups and throwing a weighted ball, among other exercises. While pulling on a resistance band, she tells her trainer: \u201cThis is light.\u201dThat video may surprise visitors to the court, who can be struck by how slowly Ginsburg moves, her head often bowed, when the court session ends for the day and justices leave the bench in full view of the audience. Justices Samuel Alito and Elena Kagan have taken to waiting until Ginsburg exits because she otherwise would be left by herself as she makes her way to the justices\u2019 robing room.But she has walked at a deliberate pace for years. Once, after remaining seated well after the other justices had departed, she explained that she had accidentally kicked off a shoe during the arguments and couldn\u2019t locate it with her feet.Ginsburg usually grips a handrail to go down the few steps from the bench in the courtroom. But there was no railing for her to grab on a November day when she followed a director\u2019s instructions through several takes and climbed the steps in front of the courthouse for a scene in \u201cOn the Basis of Sex,\u201d a movie about Ginsburg\u2019s rise in the legal profession that is due out this year.Ginsburg\u2019s friend Ann Claire Williams, a newly retired federal appeals court judge, said sometimes people get the wrong idea from Ginsburg\u2019s small stature and think she is frail.\u201cShe is so spry,\u201d said Williams, adding that Ginsburg\u2019s mind is also sharp, and her recall on cases \u201cextraordinary.\u201dTrump remarked during the campaign that he might get to name four justices while president. But conservatives hoping to lock in a majority on the court during Trump\u2019s presidency would be happy for now with just one more vacancy. They are focused not on Ginsburg, but on the prospect that Justice Anthony Kennedy might retire this year. Kennedy, too, has hired law clerks for next term, a possible hint he plans on staying. The Above the Law blog first reported on Ginsburg\u2019s and Kennedy\u2019s clerk hirings.Ginsburg\u2019s decision to stay on past Obama\u2019s time in the White House upset progressives because they feared \u2013 and conservatives now hope \u2013 a more conservative justice might replace her.\u201cThe assumption was she can\u2019t go \u2018til she\u2019s 87, but maybe she will,\u201d said Curt Levey, president of the conservative Committee for Justice.She has been counted out before, wrongly.When Ginsburg had a second cancer surgery, for pancreatic cancer in 2009, Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., inelegantly forecast that she would die within a year. He later apologized.In a speech just over a year later, Ginsburg said, \u201cI am pleased to report that, contrary to Sen. Bunning\u2019s prediction, I am alive and in good health.\u201dBunning died last year.Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2DP0aX7", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/27/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-84-no-hurry-retire/1072098001/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Erin Kelly", "body": "Reps.

That probe includes looking into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians and possible obstruction of justice by President Trump in his efforts to limit the investigation.The committee's Republican majority voted Monday night to declassify and release the four-page memo, while Democrats opposed it.

The new tax push is part of a previously announced $400 million the group plans to spend on politics and policy during the two-year election cycle, the group\u2019s largest midterm political investment.\u201cThere is a healthy skepticism among the majority of Americans about politics in this country,\u201d Tim Phillips, who oversees the largest grassroots arms of the political and policy empire founded by billionaire industrialist Charles Koch, said of early polling showing many voters opposed the tax bill as it sped through Congress last month.\u201cOur job is to make sure we shine a spotlight on those benefits that are occurring because of this law,\u201d Phillips said.More: House passes tax bill, again and with fixes, sending final $1.5 trillion package to TrumpMore: 'Safe, strong and proud' will be message of Trump's first State of the Union, officials sayRepublicans face stiff headwinds in the midterms: President Trump\u2019s approval ratings sit at historic lows, and a first-term president\u2019s party typically loses ground in Congress in the midterm elections. The GOP also is confronting a string of recent Democratic victories at the ballot box, including capturing a Wisconsin state Senate seat this month in a rural district Trump won by a large margin in 2016.\u201cThe left is energized right now,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just marches.\u201dThe push to persuade voters on the tax overhaul comes as network leaders celebrated conservative policy wins under\u00a0Trump, ranging from his efforts to rollback Obama-era environmental regulations to the rapid appointment and Senate confirmation of conservative judges.Last year, the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed 12 Trump-nominated judges to powerful appeals courts, a record for a first-year president.The celebration is a dramatic reversal from 2016, when Charles Koch criticized Trump\u2019s policies and rhetoric on the campaign trail.

Journalists who attend face several restrictions, including limits on photographing the proceedings or identifying attendees.In all, the network counts 700 contributors who commit to giving at least $100,000 a year to support Koch priorities.

The Senate hasn't taken up the bill yetIn December, the House voted mostly along party lines to expand the right to carry concealed weapons, in what NRA's top lobbyist Chris Cox called a \"watershed moment for Second Amendment Rights.\"And just this week, Trump's 2019 budget proposal to Congress proposed a 16% cut in federal grants to help states boost their reporting of criminal records and protection orders to the national database used for background checks on gun purchasers.NRA officials did not immediately respond to an interview request Thursday,Those\u00a0Washington wins\u00a0come after record spending in the 2016 election by gun-rights forces.The National Rifle Association and other gun-rights\u00a0organizations spent nearly $55 million in the 2016 election cycle to oppose or support candidates through independent spending \u2014 nearly 19 times the amount spent by groups promoting gun restrictions, according to a tally be the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.Trump was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the NRA's spending in the last election, with the group pumping more than $31 million\u00a0into advertising to boost his candidacy and to attack his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.In addition, more than $61 million in NRA money has gone to back current members of Congress, most of which benefited Republicans.

John McCain, a former GOP presidential nominee, who benefited from $7.7 million in NRA spending over his political career, according to the Center's data.Bess Kalb, a\u00a0writer for Jimmy Kimmel Live! has thrown a fresh spotlight on NRA's political spending this week, responding to lawmakers who are offering \"thoughts and prayers\" to the victims of Wednesday's\u00a0shooting in Florida, with tweets showing how much members of Congress\u00a0have benefited from the group's political spending.\u00a0$3,124,273 from the NRA. https://t.co/mgEnOsC03p\u2014 Bess Kalb (@bessbell) February 15, 2018The NRA's use of independent spending \u2014 on ads, mailers and emails \u2014 to mobilize voters has made it \"one of the most powerful political organizations in America,\" said Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor and author of 2011 book, Gun Fight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.\"Politicians don't listen to the NRA simply because they spend money, they listen to the NRA because the NRA's money is effectively spent swaying voters,\" he said.Sheila Krumholz, of the Center for Responsive Politics, said it's not just money that gives the NRA influence, but its active membership of nearly five million activists.\"The money is a megaphone for another significant asset: a powerful base,\" she said.\u00a0Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2GgI51N", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/15/nras-big-spending-pays-off-clout-and-wins-washington/341257002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jeffrey Schweers", "body": "CLOSE\n\n\n\n\n\n    Hear what students, parents and teachers affected by school shootings told President Donald Trump.\n    USA TODAY\n\n\n\nThis Feb. 21 photo shows Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student Cameron Kasky, left, asking a question to Sen.

Rick Scott, who has supported the NRA and voted on legislation favoring less gun control in the past would suddenly pivot to support some gun relations, Hammer said she didn\u2019t \u201chave a crystal ball.\u201d\nBut she warned:\u00a0\u201cWhen you abandon law-abiding gun owners to cater to anti-gun groups there\u2019s trouble ahead.\u201d\nSeveral political experts and advocates cited three main reasons why this shooting is different: the children leading the movement, the timing of the shooting while the Legislature was in session, and a volatile election year where voters are angry at government inaction.\n\u201cNot only is it an election year but many lawmakers see the blue wave leading the election year, especially here in Florida,\u201d said Daniel Smith, a political science professor at the University of Florida.\nAt least two special elections in Florida turned two GOP legislative seats blue. Democrat Annette Taddeo beat Republican Jose Felix Diaz in September to replace Republican Frank Artiles. Last week, Margaret Good defeated a Republican and a Libertarian to win a seat vacated by Republican Alex Miller.\n\u201cElections matter, and many elected officials are moving in a way not anticipated,\u201d Smith said. \u201cOf course it is one thing to have a flurry of legislative activity and another thing to see if these bills move forward and get voted on or watered down.\u201d\nSeeing students lead the way was a significant difference between Parkland and past shootings, said Susan MacManus, a political science professor at the University of South Florida.\n\u201cThey headed to Tallahassee in mass numbers but were led by the children who said they had to witness the worst moment of their lives and step over the dead bodies of their friends,\" Macmanus said.\nThe shooting created a unified outrage and mobilized enough people to make a huge impression at the Capitol, she said, and that created the tipping point \u201cwhen you say enough is not enough.\u201d\nAnd GOP lawmakers recognized that for what it was \u2014 a movement.\nLike this topic?

Rick Scott unveiled a $500 million plan to address safety in schools.\n    USA TODAY\n\n\n\nThe gun legislation being offered is mostly cosmetic, she added. For example, raising the age to 21 for rifle purchases is woefully inadequate. The Sutherland Springs, Texas, shooter was 26. The Pulse nightclub shooter was 29. The Las Vegas shooter was 64.\n\u201cSo raising the age does not address the problem which is the easy availability of semiautomatic weapons and large magazines,\u201d Brigham said.\u00a0She said the Legislature also needs to close the gun show loophole and provide universal background checks.\nBut she is glad for the chance to debate these issues in the Legislature, and glad some of the more extreme proposals are not being embraced.\n\u201cI am feeling positive there is finally a conversation happening among our lawmakers about gun violence,\u201d Brigham said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue. It\u2019s a public safety issue that affects all Americans no matter what the party.\u201d\nMomentum has been building in Florida since Pulse, said Joe Saunders, the senior political director for Equality Florida. It took the effort of LGBT advocates to force Gov. Scott and the Legislature to recognize the shooting as a hate crime and drop the original narrative that it was a terrorist attack orchestrated by ISIS.\n\u201cThe fact that the Pulse shooting happened to Latino people who were LGBT did affect the response we got from legislators,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cIt affected the words out of their mouth, what happened at that moment and whether they were willing to listen.\u201d\nPulse survivors were among the first to go to Parkland students, provide comfort and stand with them in Tallahassee, he said.\n\u201cThe world that watched what happened at Pulse are the same people that watched what happened at Parkland,\u201d Saunders said.\nThe coalition is not pleased that\u00a0the Legislature has\u00a0not address background checks and banning assault weapons. And there are huge differences in the governor\u2019s plan and what\u2019s been laid out by the House and Senate. For instance, the governor doesn\u2019t support arming teachers, while the House and Senate\u00a0propose\u00a0arming teachers.\nBut at least they are finally at a point where debate is happening, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting that after 10 years the Legislature is willing in this moment to have a conversation about gun safety reform,\u201d he said.\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2ows9Rx", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/02/24/parkland-school-shooting-seen-turning-point-gun-control-debate/369914002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kevin Johnson", "body": "Andrew McCabe appears before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing on 'World Wide Threats', on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, USA, 11 May 2017.(Photo: MICHAEL REYNOLDS, EPA-EFE)WASHINGTON \u2013 FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who has been a target of unrelenting criticism from President Trump, abruptly announced his resignation Monday, according to a senior government official who was not authorized to comment publicly on personnel matters.\u00a0McCabe was expected to resign in March when he was eligible for retirement and full benefits.

And then he put a temporary kibosh on the NRA\u2019s top legislative priority \u2014 an expansion of concealed carry rights \u2014 and complimented one of the most outspoken gun-control proponents, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, for having some \"very good ideas.\"\nHe wants a legislative response to the latest mass shooting in Parkland, Fla.,\u00a0that's \"comprehensive\"\u00a0\u2014 and, of course, \"beautiful.\"\u00a0And he promised lawmakers they'd be \"popular\" if they were \"very powerful\"\u00a0on an expansion of background checks.\nHere are some of the most amazing things Trump said:\n1. The trouble with due processTrump liked an idea Vice President Pence promoted to give families and law enforcement greater ability to get a court order and collect all of a person's weapons if the individual is a potential danger to his or herself or others.\nBut he had one problem:\u00a0Court takes \"so long...to get the due process procedures.\"\n\"I like taking the guns early,\" he said. \"Take the guns first, go through due process second.\"\nA lack of due process was one of the arguments gun-rights advocates made against an Obama-era rule that would have barred gun ownership by some who were deemed mentally impaired by the Social Security Administration. Trump signed legislation overturning the rule last year.\n2. Who\u2019s afraid of the NRA?Answer: According Trump, Sen. Patrick Toomey, R-Penn., for one.\nTrump wanted to know why background check legislation authored by Toomey and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., doesn\u2019t raise the age for buying an AR-15 \u2014\u00a0like the one used in the Parkland shooting \u2014\u00a0from 18 to 21, the minimum age for buying a handgun. The NRA opposes increasing the age limit, but Trump said they should consider the move.\nToomey said the bill didn\u2019t address it.\n\u201cYou know why? Because you're afraid of the NRA, right?\u201d Trump said. \u201cA lot of people are afraid of that issue.\u201d\n3. Concealed carryTrump rejected repeated requests from House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., to consider including an expansion of concealed carry rights as part of a comprehensive bill. Scalise, the survivor of a shooting at\u00a0congressional baseball game practice last year, said the NRA-backed legislation would make people safer.\n\"If you add concealed carry to this, you\u2019ll never get it passed,\"\u00a0Trump said.\u00a0 \"We want to get something done.\"\nThe House already passed the bill alongside another measure designed to measure to boost authorities' reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, NICS. But concealed carry likely would have a tougher time passing the Senate, where it would need Democratic votes to pass.\n4. 'I\u2019m not into popularity'Trump, while promoting an expansion of background checks, promised members that would make them \"more popular.\"\n\u201cPeople are afraid to do background checks because you\u2019re afraid of somebody,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care who\u2019s endorsing you or not endorsing you.

Bush, said it was important for the public to hear from Sessions in wake of Trump's latest criticism.\n\"I think he was reminding the American people of a key attribute that we need\u00a0 in an attorney general and that is integrity,\" Barr said. \"He's saying, 'Look, I'm calling things as I see it.' \"\nTrump's latest offensive against Sessions, the most pointed criticism since last spring and summer,\u00a0is fraught with risk.\u00a0\nAny move to oust Sessions could be viewed as an attempt to wrest control of Mueller's wide-ranging inquiry. That investigation includes whether the\u00a0president has sought to obstruct the probe.\n\"If Trump removes Sessions, Mueller would have to look at this very carefully in combination with the president's dismissal of (former FBI Director James) Comey as an effort to damage, derail or slowdown the Russia investigation,\" said Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor.\nCotter said Trump's past tweets and public statements have already demonstrated the president's disappointment in Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia inquiry last year. Indeed,\u00a0Trump was so angry with Sessions' recusal that the attorney general offered his resignation, which the president did not accept.)\nFormer U.S. attorney general Edwin Meese, left,  speaks while flanked by FBI Director James Comey and former congressman Timothy Roemer, D-Ind., during a news conference at FBI headquarters held to discuss the recent review of the 9/11 Commission Report.\u00a0(Photo: Mark Wilson, Getty Images)\n\n\"And in the (May) interview with NBC, he acknowledged firing Comey because of his handling of the Russia investigation. Whatever Trump does, it seems to make it easier for prosecutors,\" Cotter said.\nThe political costs of removing Sessions could be just as risky.\nThe attorney general still enjoys fairly strong support among Republicans for aggressively pursuing Trump's agenda at the Justice Department.\nIn addition to focusing attention on recent spikes in homicide, he has ordered a sweeping review of police reform agreements that punished troubled agencies; rolled back a series of Obama-era civil rights actions, including a Justice Department challenge to a controversial voter identification law in Texas; and threatened so-called sanctuary cities for harboring illegal immigrants.\nIn January, the attorney general also paved the way for tougher marijuana enforcement when he rescinded the previous administration's policy of non-interference with state laws allowing the use\u00a0of medical and recreational pot.\nEarlier this week, Rep. Pete King, R-N.Y., citing Sessions' loyalty, said the president should refrain from publicly rebuking the attorney general.\n\"Jeff Sessions is loyal to the president, and he's one of the first to support him,\" King said on Fox News. \"He's often in very difficult positions, and I think he's trying to reconcile as best as he can.\"\nBut Republican support is not unanimous.\nHouse Freedom Caucus leaders Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Jim Jordan of Ohio called for the attorney general to step down. The congressmen, citing Sessions' recusal from the Russia inquiry, assert that the attorney general can no longer adequately manage the department and the FBI.\nTrump's attacks on Sessions and the possible implications for the Russia investigation, however, have spawned some unlikely alliances with some\u00a0Democrats urging Sessions to remain.\nCarry onIn January, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who voted against Sessions' confirmation, said the attorney general should not resign.\n\"Nothing, nothing should ever interfere with the Mueller investigation,\" he said then.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Thursday that she knew of no plans for Trump to fire Sessions.\nMeanwhile, Sessions\u00a0is drawing inspiration and encouragement from some of the same men whose portraits hang in his fifth-floor conference room at the Justice Department.\nOne of them, Meese, said he has spoken to the attorney general recently and urged him to carry on.\n\"I was impressed,\" Meese said. \"He was in good spirits.

Sorensen has denied his former wife's claims.Yet the White House's handling of the matters, specifically Porter, has largely focused on chief of staff John Kelly.As Porter announced his resignation mid-day Wednesday,\u00a0Kelly issued a statement calling him \"a man of true integrity and honor.\" Hours later,\u00a0after pictures surfaced showing one of Porter's ex-wives with a black eye, Kelly issued a more critical statement\u00a0saying he \"was shocked\" by \"the new allegations released today.\"Kelly said in that second statement that \"there is no place for domestic violence in our society,\" but he added that \"I stand by my previous comments of the Rob Porter that I have come to know since becoming chief of staff, and believe every individual deserves the right to defend their reputation.\"\u00a0More: White House staffer Rob Porter resigns amid abuse allegationsMore: Rob Porter scandal, explained: Who is he, why he resigned, what his ex-wives say, moreAs questions continued to swirl over how the two officials were permitted to join the White House staff, Trump has appeared to side with the accused men.

Rand Paul, a conservative Kentucky Republican and one-time presidential contender, temporarily blocked a Senate vote on a sweeping bipartisan budget deal on Thursday \u2014 a move that could force Congress to miss a midnight funding deadline and trigger a partial government shutdown.The government will run out of money at midnight unless Congress passes the budget deal.If the government shuts down, it would mark the second time in less than a month that federal agencies have been shuttered\u00a0because Congress could not reach an agreement to keep them open.The last shutdown was triggered early Jan. 20, when Congress failed to pass a short-term spending bill. The shutdown ended three days later, when lawmakers passed a bill to keep the government open through Thursday.The impact of another shutdown would be minimal, unless it drags on for several days, said Stan Collender, a federal budget expert.\u201cThere technically would be a government shutdown at midnight but no one would notice until about 9 o\u2019clock the next morning,\u201d Collender said. \u201c...They\u2019ve got until the next morning before it would have an effect.\u201dAs long as lawmakers and the Trump administration knew the impasse would be resolved by noon Friday or sooner, they would probably not close federal agencies or furlough workers, Collender said.\u201cThey would probably tell everyone, \u2018It\u2019s going to get resolved, so plan on coming into the office anyway,\u2019\u201d he said.What impact would the public see?\u201cThe answer is maybe nothing,\u201d Collender said. \u201cThe Trump administration hinted with the last shutdown that they\u2019d keep the national parks open\u2026 That\u2019s really the most immediate impact. If the parks are open, then no one would notice\u201d unless it dragged on passed Sunday.Contributing: Gregory Korte\u00a0Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2nU176s", "link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/08/trump-administration-advises-federal-agencies-prepare-limited-government-shutdown/321883002/", "source": "USA Today", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}]
