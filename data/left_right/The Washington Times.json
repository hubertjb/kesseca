[{"author": "Stephen Dinan", "body": "A federal judge in New York ruled Tuesday that the government must fully restart the Obama-era DACA deportation amnesty and accept brand new applicants as well as renewals, throwing a potential wrench in the ongoing debate over the fate of \u201cDreamers\u201d on Capitol Hill.Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis said the administration does have the power to revoke DACA, but it must give a sound reason for doing so \u2014 and the Homeland Security Department\u2019s September 2017 rationale fell far short of what is required in that regard.He becomes the second judge to rule President Trump\u2019s aides bungled the phaseout \u2014 but his decision is the most wide-ranging, ordering the government to not only allow those already in the program to renew their applications but also ordering the government to accept new applications.\u201cThe question before the court is thus not whether defendants could end the DACA program, but whether they offered legally adequate reasons for doing so,\u201d wrote Judge Garaufis, a Clinton appointee to the court. \u201cBased on its review of the record before it, the court concludes that defendants have not done so.\u201dThe judge said the Trump administration can still rescind the program in the future if it does it the right way.And he said the administration doesn\u2019t have to approve any specific DACA applications. But it must begin to process applications again.Mr. Trump had set a March 5 phaseout data for the DACA program, whose full name is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Created by the Obama administration through executive action in 2012, it is currently protecting nearly 700,000 Dreamers from deportation.Mr. Trump had said the program was illegal and announced the phaseout, saying it was up to Congress to come up with a more firm legal status for Dreamers.", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Stephen Dinan", "body": "President Donald Trump Friday threatened to veto the massive $1.3 trillion spending plan approved by Congress, saying the bill abandons so-called \u201cDreamers\u201d and does not fully fund construction of a border wall.\n\u201cI am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded,\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\nI am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\n\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2018The House approved a $1.3 trillion spending bill Thursday to fund the government for the rest of fiscal year 2018 and the Senate followed suit early Friday morning, beating the shutdown deadline and leaving Republicans and Democrats to fight over credit and blame.\n\n                      \n\n                      \n                        SEE ALSO: Congress clears massive spending bill in midnight vote\n                      \n                      \nThe bill was a testament to what Congress could do when both sides agreed to open the federal checkbook, with the GOP touting the biggest cash infusion for the military in 15 years, and Democrats saying they won billions of dollars in new spending on health care, education and infrastructure despite being largely shut out of power in Washington, D.C.\nThe White House said President Trump will sign the bill \u2014 even though he lamented he had to \u201cwaste money on Dem giveaways\u201d to get the $80 billion in funding increases for the military and a first down payment on a U.S.-Mexico border wall.\n\u201cIs it perfect? No. Is it exactly what we asked for in the budget? No. Were we ever going to get that? No, that\u2019s not how the process works,\u201d said White House budget director Mick Mulvaney.\nHouse lawmakers voted 256-167 to approve the bill, with 145 Republicans and 111 Democrats in favor and 90 Republicans and 77 Democrats opposed.\nThe Senate then voted 65-32 in favor of the bill.\nIn both cases, opposition was drawn from the ideological ends of the parties, with the most conservative Republicans and most liberal Democrats voting against the bill.\nOne thing most lawmakers agreed on was the ridiculous process, which saw the House vote on a 2,232-page bill around noon on Thursday, just 16 hours after the text had been released. That broke GOP rules that required three days\u2019 time between a bill\u2019s introduction and a vote.\nThe Senate, meanwhile, voted just after midnight Friday morning, speeding the vote. One senator said they compressed the schedule so lawmakers could make international flights planned for the beginning of a two-week spring break.\n\u201cThis is ridiculous. It\u2019s juvenile,\u201d said Sen. Bob Corker, Tennessee Republican.\nThe complaints were bipartisan.\n\u201cI have not read the bill,\u201d House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer, Maryland Democrat, admitted in a fiery floor speech. \u201cThe only person who could read this bill is the supercomputers.\u201d\nHe voted against the measure, but House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi backed it.\nRepublican leaders insisted that while lawmakers may not have had a chance to read this version of the bill, it was similar to legislation they\u2019d voted on last year.\nThey also defended the spending choices made, pushing back against Mr. Trump\u2019s complaints of \u201cwaste.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked to make sure not a dollar is wasted,\u201d House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen said Wednesday night as he defended the massive bill before the House Rules Committee.\nThe Pentagon gets about $700 billion in the bill. It includes a 2.4 percent military pay increase, the largest in eight years, as well as nearly $150 billion to replace and upgrade equipment, including 14 Navy ships, more than 360 aircraft and helicopters, and more than 145 fighting vehicles.\nRepublican leaders have said that the spending caps President Obama and Congress agreed to in 2011 have hollowed out the military to the point where more military members are dying because of training and readiness issues than from combat.\n\u201cThe threat of American military decline is now coming to an end,\u201d said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan. \u201cThat is a promise that we made, along with this president, to the American people. And it is a promise that we are keeping today, and we\u2019re pleased to do so.\u201d\nThe measure also gives a $63 billion boost to non-defense discretionary spending, bringing those levels to about $600 billion in 2018.\nDemocrats chose to highlight those gains, pointing to items like a $3 billion increase in funds to fight the opioid epidemic, $18 billion for infrastructure, $380 million for state grants to protect election systems from cyber attacks, and $600 million for rural broadband.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat. \u201cWe\u2019re able to accomplish more in the minority than we were when we had the presidency or even were in the majority.\u201d\nThe higher spending levels were agreed to in a February budget deal, which gave lawmakers six weeks to add more than $140 billion in new money to existing spending plans.\nUsually, spending taxpayers\u2019 money is a unifying activity for Congress. But lawmakers got into bitter disputes over policy decisions, such as whether to ban money from going to Planned Parenthood, whether to keep sending grant money to sanctuary cities, how much to pay for Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall and what to do about illegal immigrant \u201cDreamers.\u201d\nMr. Frelinghuysen and other House and Senate appropriators crafted the package, but the big ideological battles were settled by Mr. Ryan, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican.\nMany conservative Republicans said the bill fell short on Mr. Trump\u2019s promises, ceding ground on issues like abortion, guns, and immigration as well as accepting a massive boost in deficits.\n\u201cThis is wrong. This is not the limited government conservatism our voters demand. Our constituents \u2014 our employers \u2014 deserve better,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows, North Carolina Republican and chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.\nThe bill allocates $1.6 billion for border security measures that the president wanted, but both sides disputed exactly how much would be dedicated to building the wall itself.\nDemocrats complained that the bill didn\u2019t offer new protections to Dreamers who benefit from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\u201cIt is indefensible for Congress to pass a spending bill that not only leaves Dreamers without permanent protections but also funds their deportations and those of immigrants with deep ties to their communities,\u201d the Congressional Hispanic Caucus said in urging its members to vote \u201cno.\u201d\nWith the midterm election season already under way, the \u201comnibus\u201d spending bill could be one of the the last major pieces of legislation Congress clears this year, and lawmakers raced to attach other legislative priorities as well.\nThe bill includes a gun-related measure incentivizing states and federal agencies to submit more of their records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which flags people like felons and domestic abusers who are banned from buying guns.\nThe legislation also retains a longstanding ban on federal health agencies using money to advocate or promote gun control, but clarifies that they can still conduct research into the causes of gun violence \u2014 another minor win for gun control advocates who argue the ban has still had a chilling effect on research.\nSen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who chairs a state/foreign operations spending subcommittee, also secured language he had been pushing for several years that ends federal money for the Palestinian Authority until it clearly demonstrates it has stopped funding terrorist activities.\nThe Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

Comey lied to them and had a plan to double-cross President Trump.\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina sent a letter last week to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. They and two other Republicans want a special counsel with the powers of the Trump-Russia probe\u2019s Robert Mueller to investigate suspected Justice Department corruption.\nThey attached a second letter to Michael E. Horowitz, the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, outlining all the avenues that need to be navigated \u2014 complete with new and expanded accusations. They want an investigation to look at whether Mr. Comey set up Mr. Trump as president-elect.\nMr. Comey visited Mr. Trump for an intelligence briefing at Trump Tower days before he took office. Mr. Comey broke the news about what he called a \u201csalacious and unverified\u201d dossier now known to have been bought by the Democratic Party from its contractor, former British spy Christopher Steele. It told of Mr. Trump supposedly frolicking with prostitutes in Moscow and overseeing Russia\u2019s hacking of Democratic Party computers.\nAt the moment Mr. Comey called the scintillating dossier \u201cunverified,\u201d the FBI was using it to justify a wiretap on former Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page.\nThe briefing instantly leaked to CNN, rocking the transition team with a series of unverified dossier accusations. BuzzFeed then posted the 35-page dossier, which remains unconfirmed publicly.\n\u201cThere is a question as to whether the FBI included the dossier in the briefing, and possibly leaked that it had done so, in order to provide the media a pretext to report on the dossier,\u201d Mr. Grassley and Mr. Graham wrote.\nDemocrats, such as Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, seized on the dossier as authentic and used it to pummel the Trump White House for more than a year.\nThe Grassley-Graham letter also asserts that information provided to the Judiciary Committee by Mr. Comey in a private interview is directly contradicted by the FBI\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications to spy on Mr. Page.\n\u201cDid Director Comey intentionally mislead the committee?\u201d the senators say in the letter.\nThe senators also asked the inspector general to get to the bottom of one key question in the nearly yearlong wiretap warrant.\nThe FBI asked a FISA judge to approve the surveillance, mostly on the word of Mr. Steele\u2019s dossier. The FBI did not disclose to the judge that the dossier was Democratic Party opposition research paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign. The Republicans want Mr. Horowitz to find out why there was no disclosure.\n\u201cDid anyone express any concerns about the propriety of presenting unverified, uncorroborated claims from the Steele dossier as the basis for a FISA warrant on an American citizen?\u201d the letter stated.\nThe letter also asked for an investigation into Mr. Steele\u2019s ties to the Russian government and its intelligence services. The dossier\u2019s claims, all of which have been denied by Trump people, were sourced by Mr. Steele to unknown Kremlin operatives. Mr. Steele was once posted at the British Embassy in Moscow while an MI6 spy.\nSince the Oct. 21, 2016, FISA warrant allowed the FBI to seize emails and digital messages before the start of the Trump campaign, the senators asked if Obama administration political appointees read those documents.\nAfter the FBI fired Mr. Steele for breaking a pledge not to go to the press, the investigative firm Fusion GPS, his paymaster, set up a back channel to the bureau team investigating the Trump campaign, according to the letter. The flow of information went from Mr. Steele to Fusion GPS to Associate Attorney General Bruce Ohr to FBI investigators.\nAt the time, Mr. Ohr\u2019s wife, Nellie, worked at Fusion and was investigating Mr. Trump. Mr. Ohr, whose office was steps away from the Obama Justice Department hierarchy, was subsequently demoted.\n\u201cWas anyone in the Justice Department, including senior leadership, aware that Mr. Ohr continued to pass information from Steele and Fusion GPS to the FBI even after Steele was suspended, and terminated, as a source?\u201d the letter said.\nMr. Grassley and Mr. Graham already have urged the Justice Department to investigate whether Mr. Steele told a fundamental lie to the FBI that skewed how the bureau filled out its Carter Page wiretap proposals.\nAt first, their Steele referral to the Justice Department in January was highly classified and redacted. But that changed.\nRep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, pressed the FBI to turn over FISA material. He then wrote a memo exposing what he considered the abuses and got it cleared by the White House.\nMr. Schiff, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, then wrote a rebuttal, which mostly was cleared by the White House, resulting in more information being declassified.\nOn the Senate side, that resulted in the lifting of more redactions from the Steele referral.\nA key disclosure appeared for the first time in the Grassley-Graham referral, and it came from Mr. Schiff\u2019s rebuttal of a few weeks earlier.\nThe issue is this: Before a judge, the FBI used a Yahoo News story to bolster Mr. Steele\u2019s claim that Mr. Page, while on a trip to Moscow, visited two high-ranking Kremlin figures and discussed bribes for sanctions. Mr. Page repeatedly has denied this under oath.\nThe FBI asserted to the judge that Mr. Steele wasn\u2019t the source, even though the Yahoo story continued the exact same information. The public now knows Mr. Steele made that pledge to the FBI.\nIn a previously redacted sentence taken directly form the FBI\u2019s FISA application, the bureau wrote, \u201c[Mr. Steele] told the FBI that he/she only provided this information to the business associate [Fusion GPS] and the FBI.\u201d\nIf the FBI is quoting Mr. Steele correctly, then he lied, the senators say.\nThe following spring, Mr. Steele admitted in a court filing in London that he did in fact speak to Yahoo in September in Washington at the urging of Fusion. It is on that basis that Mr. Nunes says Mr. Steele lied, and that Mr. Grassley and Mr. Graham are seeking an investigation.\nSaid the referral: \u201cThe FBI repeatedly represented to the court that Mr. Steele told the FBI he did not have unauthorized contacts with the press about the dossier prior to October 2016. The FISA applications make these claims specifically in the context of the September 2016 Yahoo News article. But Mr. Steele has admitted \u2014 publicly before a court of law \u2014 that he did have such contacts with the press at this time, and his former business partner [Fusion founder Glenn] Simpson has confirmed it to the Committee.\u201d\nMr. Comey has defended himself via his Twitter account against corruption charges from Mr. Trump. His memoir is due out April 17, and he has scheduled a busy round of media interviews.\n\u201cMr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon.

Homan, the agency\u2019s deputy director.\u201cFewer jail arrests mean more arrests on the street, and that also requires more resources, which is why we are forced to send additional resources to those areas to meet operational needs and officer safety,\u201d Mr. Homan said. \u201cConsistent with our public safety mission, 88 percent of those arrested during this operation were convicted criminals.\u201dThe actions and notices came even as Congress was debating \u2014 and failing to pass \u2014 legislation that would have legalized about a sixth of the illegal immigrant population in the U.S.ICE said some of those nabbed will be prosecuted for illegal entry or re-entry after a previous deportation, while others whose cases aren\u2019t prosecuted will face deportation.Perhaps more striking that the arrests, however, is the renewed focus on business that employ illegal immigrants.The 122 notices come on top of 77 notices served on businesses in northern California earlier this year.ICE said California\u2019s sanctuary city status notwithstanding, businesses are still required to follow federal law, which demands they conduct verification checks before hiring employees.Democrats in Congress had objected to ICE\u2019s attempts to enforce immigration laws at businesses.In a Jan. 31 letter, 17 of the chamber\u2019s more liberal lawmakers said they were \u201ctroubled\u201d by the justifications ICE had cited for the previous round of business enforcement.\u201cICE officers have a mission to promote homeland security and public safety, not to act as an arm of the government designed to intimidate and harass business owners, their employees or their patrons, and certainly not to use raids as a threat of \u2018what\u2019s to come,\u2019\u201d said the Democrats, led by Rep.

Nobody should vote for this bill,\u201d he said.\nFaced with that reluctance among conservatives, GOP leaders will likely need a significant number of Democrats to vote for the bill in order to pass it through the House \u2014 and would need Democratic support no matter what to overcome a filibuster in the Senate.\nTiming is also becoming an issue. New funding must be secured before Saturday, or the government will spiral into its third partial shutdown of the year.\nDemocrats orchestrated the first shutdown in January over demands that illegal immigrant \u201cDreamers\u201d get protections from deportation.

That shutdown only lasted hours.\nMr. Paul said Tuesday he\u2019s not sure whether he\u2019ll use procedural tactics to push this latest bill past the Friday deadline.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have signaled they won\u2019t demand action on Dreamers \u2014 but have also said they won\u2019t accept Mr. Trump\u2019s demand for a massive infusion of cash to build a border wall.\nLeaders were also weighing whether to attach bipartisan legislation to encourage states and federal agencies to share more of their records with the national gun-purchase background check system.\nThe stand-alone measure, which has attracted more than 70 co-sponsors in the Senate, has gotten renewed attention after last month\u2019s high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that claimed the lives of 17 students and faculty.\nThe House passed the bill, known as \u201cFix NICS,\u201d last year, earning the support of conservatives by attaching an expansion of concealed carry rights.\nNow those conservatives say it would be a betrayal to move Fix NICS without the concealed-carry legislation attached.\nIn addition to abortion, immigration, and guns, another open issue creating a snag in the talks is $900 million in funding for a Hudson River tunnel project.\nMr. Trump has suggested the money would earn a veto from him.\nBut the project is dear to Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said this is probably one of the most needed public works projects, not just for New York and New Jersey, but for the whole eastern corridor,\u201d he said, warning that if the current tunnels fail, it could plunge the country into a recession by halting commerce.\nMr. Schumer said the final details of the bill were being written by top four Capitol Hill party leaders \u2014 himself, Mr. Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\u201cA few sticking points remain, but we are very close to signing off on legislation that both houses will be able to take up and pass by the end of the week,\u201d he said.\nMr. McConnell, for his part, said there would be \u201cplenty of time\u201d to look at the details of the bill between the time it was released and voted on.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do it this week. And as long as that takes, that\u2019s the time we\u2019ll put in to get there,\u201d he said.\nCongress is scheduled to flee Washington on Friday for a two-week spring break \u2014 just as thousands of pro-gun control protesters are expected to descend on Capitol Hill to rally for stiffer national laws.\nThe Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

They also recount different conversations he had with Comey, who kept notes on meetings with Trump that unnerved him.\nThough the precise contents are unknown, the memos possibly could help substantiate McCabe\u2019s assertion that he was unfairly maligned by a White House he says had declared \u201cwar\u201d on the FBI and Mueller\u2019s investigation. They almost certainly contain, as Comey\u2019s memos did, previously undisclosed details about encounters between the Trump administration and FBI that could be of interest to Mueller.\nThe disclosure Saturday came hours after Trump called McCabe\u2019s firing by Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u201ca great day for Democracy\u201d and asserted without elaboration that McCabe knew \u201call about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels off the FBI!\u201d In the last year, Trump has repeatedly condemned McCabe as emblematic of an FBI that he insists is biased against his administration.\nThat sent former CIA Director John Brennan, an outspoken Trump critic, into a Twitter tizzy: \u201cWhen the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history. You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America\u2026America will triumph over you.\u201d\nSessions said he acted on the recommendation of FBI disciplinary officials who said McCabe had not been candid with a watchdog office investigation. McCabe was fired two days before his retirement date on Sunday. The dismissal likely jeopardizes his ability to collect his full pension benefits and, more broadly, could add to the turmoil that has enveloped the FBI since Comey\u2019s firing and as the bureau moves ahead with an investigation the White House has dismissed as a hoax.\nAn upcoming inspector general\u2019s report is expected to conclude that McCabe, who spent more than 20 years with the FBI, had authorized the release of information to the media and was not forthcoming with the watchdog office as it examined the bureau\u2019s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. McCabe has vigorously disputed the allegations and said his credibility had been attacked as \u201cpart of a larger effort not just to slander me personally\u201d but also the FBI and law enforcement.\n\u201cIt is part of this administration\u2019s ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the special counsel investigation, which continue to this day,\u201d he added. \u201cTheir persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the special counsel\u2019s work.\u201d\nThe firing set off dueling tweets between Trump, who called the termination a \u201cgreat day for the hard working men and women of the FBI,\u201d and Comey, the director he fired 10 months ago.\nTrump called Comey \u201csanctimonious\u201d and said Comey made McCabe \u201clook like a choirboy.\u201d Comey, referencing his highly anticipated book that comes out next month, responded with his own tweet: \u201cMr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon. And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.\u201d\nAlso Saturday, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, John Dowd, cited the \u201cbrilliant and courageous example\u201d by Sessions and the FBI\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility and said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should \u201cbring an end\u201d to the Russia investigation \u201cmanufactured\u201d by Comey.\nDowd told the AP that he neither was calling on Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller\u2019s inquiry, to fire the special counsel immediately nor had discussed with Rosenstein the idea of dismissing Mueller or ending the probe.\nMueller is investigating whether Trump\u2019s actions, including Comey\u2019s ouster, constitute obstruction of justice. McCabe could be an important witness, and his memos could be used by investigators as they look into whether Trump sought to thwart the FBI probe. Comey\u2019s own memos, including one in which he says Trump encouraged him to end an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, have been provided to Mueller and are part of his investigation.\nMcCabe, in a statement defending himself, asserted he was singled out by the administration because of the \u201crole I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath\u201d of Comey\u2019s firing last May.\nHe became acting director after that but clashed with the Trump administration, including when he publicly rejected White House assertions that Comey had lost the support of the rank-and-file. He abruptly left the deputy director position in January and went on leave.\nThe firing arises from an inspector general review into how the FBI handled the Clinton email investigation. That inquiry focused not only on specific decisions made by FBI leadership but also on news media leaks.\nMcCabe came under scrutiny over an October 2016 news report that revealed differing approaches within the FBI and Justice Department over how aggressively the Clinton Foundation should be investigated. The watchdog office has concluded that McCabe authorized FBI officials to speak to a Wall Street Journal reporter for that story and that McCabe had not been forthcoming with investigators. McCabe denies it.\nMcCabe became entangled in presidential politics in 2016 after it was revealed that his wife, during her unsuccessful run for state Senate in Virginia one year earlier, received campaign contributions from the political action committee of then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe, D-Va., a longtime Clinton friend. The FBI has said McCabe received the necessary ethics approval about his wife\u2019s candidacy and was not supervising the Clinton investigation at the time of the contributions.\n\u2022 Associated Press writer Chad Day contributed to this report.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.  \n\nThe Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

I think the answer is in the middle, and in this class I talk about how it\u2019s important to get your personal politics out. It\u2019s destructive to become too politicized. The emotion should be directed at doing more work, not some feeling or personal conclusion,\u201d Mr. Woodward told Newsweek.\nHis advice for those conducting an interview: \u201cShut up, and just listen.\u201d\nMr. Woodward also noted that President Nixon most likely would not have tweeted when he was in office, had the technology been around during the Watergate era.\n\u201cHe would have delegated it. In a sense, his secret tapes are his tweets,\u201d observed Mr. Woodward.\nMODERN ROMANCE\nJust so you know. WCBS, the CBS affiliate in New York City, reports a new trend in engagement rings. Young women are now having their diamond embedded in their ring finger in a ceremonial piercing.\n\u201cA piercing artist marks the spot with a pen, cleans with alcohol and iodine, uses a tool to remove a small patch of skin, and then inserts an anchor made of titanium or gold,\u201d WCBS reported. \u201cThe whole process takes about 10 minutes and costs around $100 for the piercing.\u201d\nOf course, the diamond is extra, healing takes up to 20 weeks and the site must be cleaned two to three times daily. A Manhattan dermatologist also warned that underlying tendons could be damaged, and that there was a real danger should the embedded diamond snag on clothing or anything else.\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\u2022 48 percent of Americans say Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election did not benefit the campaigns of either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump; 75 percent of Republicans and 23 percent of Democrats agree.\n\u2022 42 percent of Americans overall think the efforts benefited Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign; 14 percent of Republicans and 74 percent of Democrats agree.\n\u2022 4 percent overall think the efforts benefited Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign; 7 percent of Republicans and 1 percent of Democrats agree.\n\u2022 36 percent overall are \u201csomewhat confident\u201d Robert Mueller will conduct a fair investigation into Russian involvement in the election; 35 percent of Republicans and 36 percent of Democrats agree.\n\u2022 25 percent are \u201cvery confident\u201d it will be a fair investigation; 11 percent of Republicans and 39 percent of Democrats agree.\n\u2022 19 percent are \u201cnot too confident\u201d the investigation will be fair; 24 percent of Republicans and 15 percent of Democrats agree.\n\u2022 18 percent are \u201cnot at all confident\u201d it will be fair; 26 percent of Republicans and 8 percent of Democrats agree.\nSource: A Pew Research Center survey of 1,466 U.S. adults conducted March 7-14.\n\u2022 Chatter and facts to [email\u00a0protected]\nThe Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

Trey Gowdy, South Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Oversight Committee, also said judges wouldn\u2019t have authorized and repeatedly renewed a warrant to spy on the former Trump aide, Carter Page, if it hadn\u2019t been for that very material, compiled by investigator Christopher Steele in a controversial dossier.\u201cThey could have easily said it was the DNC and Hillary Clinton. That would have been really easy,\u201d Mr. Gowdy told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, referring to footnotes in the agents\u2019 request to the court. \u201cIt took longer to explain it the way they did, than if they just come right out and said, \u2018Hillary Clinton for America and DNC paid for it.\u2019 But they didn\u2019t do that.\u201dMr. Gowdy was involved in drafting a four-page memo by the House Intelligence Committee that details the FBI\u2019s decision to rely in part on Clinton-backed material to spy on Mr. Page in October 2016. It also explores the role of top Justice Department officials in renewing those snooping powers.President Trump says the memo  \u201ctotally vindicates\u201d him, as he\u2019s dogged by claims his campaign colluded with Russians in 2016.Yet it\u2019s kicking up a political firestorm, with Democrats chastising its lead author, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, for peeling back the curtain on the secretive U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and its sensitive processes.They say the memo amounts to a misleading \u201chit job\u201d designed to sow doubt about probes into the Trump campaign\u2019s alleged interactions with Russian actors.And they say it doesn\u2019t reflect all of the material that went into the government snooping application.That drew a rebuke from Mr. Gowdy.\u201cI wish that they were equally concerned about what\u2019s not in the FISA application, which is a lot of really important information about the source, and its sub-sources, and the fact that he was hired by the DNC and the Clinton campaign, and the fact that he was biased against President Trump,\u201d said Mr. Gowdy, who last week said he will return to the legal field instead of seeking re-election.\u201cI would argue it\u2019s also somewhat unprecedented to rely on political opposition research to instruct and inform an application, and it\u2019s really bad precedent and unprecedented to not tell a court that a source has this level of bias,\u201d he said.Mr. Gowdy said he hopes the revealing memo is a \u201cone-off,\u201d but he also thinks it\u2019s important to detail how the FBI sought its snooping powers, since the judge \u201cdoesn\u2019t do independent research.\u201dHe is among top Republicans preaching caution, even as vocal conservatives say heads should roll at the FBI and Justice Department.Mr. Gowdy said the probe into the Trump campaign by special counsel Robert Mueller goes far beyond the controversial memo.\u201cThere is a Russia investigation without a dossier,\u201d he said, rattling off a list of things outside of its scope, such as a mysterious meeting between a Russian lawyer and Trump officials at Trump Tower.The GOP memo itself says the FBI dug into the Trump campaign after another one of its aides, George Papadopoulos, reportedly boasted in mid-2016 that Russia had dirt on Mrs. Clinton.Democrats have warned Mr. Trump not to use the memo to go after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversaw renewals of the surveillance application and appointed Mr. Mueller, saying it would cross a red line \u2014 particularly in light of Mr. Trump\u2019s firing last year of FBI Director James B.

LOUIS \u2014 A condemned Missouri inmate faces a potentially \u201cgruesome and painful\u201d execution because of a rare medical condition that compromises the man\u2019s veins and causes multiple tumors in his head and throat, his attorney said Sunday.\nRussell Bucklew is scheduled to die by injection Tuesday evening for killing a former girlfriend\u2019s new boyfriend in 1996 in eastern Missouri.\nBucklew, 49, was moments away from execution in May 2014 when the U.S. Supreme Court halted it amid concerns about Bucklew\u2019s medical condition. He suffers from cavernous hemangioma, a rare ailment that causes weakened and malformed blood vessels, as well as blood-filled tumors in his nose and throat.\nNearly four years later, the condition has worsened, attorney Cheryl Pilate said.\n\u201cMr. Bucklew\u2019s rare and severe condition creates a very substantial risk of a gruesome execution, with choking and gagging on blood and the infliction of excruciating pain,\u201d Pilate said.\nA panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has already refused to stop the execution. An appeal and stay request are pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. Pilate also has asked for clemency from Republican Gov. Eric Greitens.\nEmail messages seeking comment Sunday from spokespeople for Greitens and Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley were not immediately returned.\nThe appeal offered a chilling possibility of what Bucklew\u2019s supporters believe could happen during the execution.\n\u201cThose highly sensitive tumors easily rupture and bleed,\u201d the appeal said. \u201cAs he struggles to breathe through the execution procedure, Bucklew\u2019s throat tumor will likely rupture,\u201d causing him to choke on his own blood.\n\u201cBucklew\u2019s execution will very likely be gruesome and painful far beyond the pain inherent in the process of an ordinary lethal injection execution,\u201d the court document said, adding it would violate Bucklew\u2019s constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment.\nIn his response to the U.S. Supreme Court, Hawley downplayed Bucklew\u2019s medical condition and cited continuing efforts over several years to put off the execution.\nBucklew\u2019s appeals also have suggested that if the execution is carried out, the state should use lethal gas instead of an injection of pentobarbital. Missouri law still lists gas as an option, but the state no longer has a gas chamber and has not used the method since 1965.\nNone of the 20 inmates executed since Missouri began using pentobarbital in 2013 have shown obvious signs of pain or suffering.\nAccording to court documents, Bucklew was angry at his girlfriend for leaving him and moving in with Michael Sanders of Cape Girardeau when he tracked her down at Sanders\u2019 home in March 1996. He killed Sanders in front of the woman, her two daughters and Sanders\u2019 two sons and then attacked the woman and drove her to a secluded area and raped her.\nAfter a state trooper spotted Bucklew\u2019s car, Bucklew shot at the trooper but missed, court records say. Bucklew later escaped from jail, hid in the home of the ex-girlfriend\u2019s mother and beat her with a hammer.\nThe execution would be the first in Missouri since January 2017.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.  \n\nThe Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

Lott Jr., the report\u2019s author and president of the research center.His findings also challenge the general narrative that immigrants commit fewer crimes. Those past studies usually don\u2019t look at legal versus illegal populations, Mr. Lott said.Mr. Lott said the Arizona data is able to peek behind that curtain, and the differences between the populations were stark.\u201cThere appears to be a huge difference between the two groups,\u201d Mr. Lott said. \u201cThe type of person who goes through the process to legally immigrate in the United States appears to be very law-abiding versus even the U.S.-born population. The reverse is true for undocumented immigrants \u2014 they are committing crimes, and more serious crimes.\u201dAmong nearly 4,000 first- and second-degree murder convictions, undocumented immigrants accounted for nearly 13 percent \u2014 significantly higher than their percentage of the population. Legal immigrants, by contrast, were less than 1 percent of convicts. Native-born made up the rest.Undocumented immigrants also accounted for five times the rate of convictions for money laundering and kidnapping, and were three times more likely to be convicted of drive-by shootings.The data covered from 1985 to 2017. For his data purposes, Mr. Lott defined undocumented immigrants as those who weren\u2019t U.S. citizens or green card holders, signaling permanent residency.He said the crime rates of the undocumented who were ages 18 to 35 was particularly important, given the ongoing debate over legalizing illegal immigrant \u201cDreamers.\u201d He said the Arizona data showed that population had crime rates 250 percent higher than their share of the population would have predicted.The Washington Times had asked several experts to look at Mr. Lott\u2019s research paper but some didn\u2019t respond, while one said he was unable to get Mr. Lott\u2019s data and had questions about Mr. Lott\u2019s methodology.Mr. Lott said told The Times that the data belonged to Arizona and his agreement was that he wouldn\u2019t give out the raw data without their approval.Mr. Sessions\u2019 citation of the data Friday inserted the information directly into the ongoing immigration debate.\u201cThey\u2019re more likely to be convicted of sexual assault, robbery, and driving under the influence.  They\u2019re more than twice as likely to be convicted of murder,\u201d Mr. Sessions said in remarks prepared for a speech in Norfolk, Virginia.He continued: \u201cTens of thousands of crimes have been committed in this country that would never have happened if our immigration laws were enforced and respected like they ought to be.\u201d\n                 LOAD COMMENTS ()\n              HIDE COMMENTS", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Stephen Dinan", "body": "Former Attorney General Eric H.

Harrison died of pneumonia only 31 days after delivering a two-hour inaugural dress without a coat or hat in a cold, wet day in a pre-antibiotics era (1841).\u201cTrump\u2019s initial rating places him in an ignominious category, but dozens of presidents have had slow starts and have course corrected to improve their public esteem,\u201d wrote Brandon Rottinghaus and Justin Vaughn, both political science professors, in an article at the New York Times outlining the survey.\u201cBeyond his reputation or ranking, Donald Trump\u2019s very presidency may alter perceptions of presidential legacies as his unique approach to the office continues to surprise,\u201d they concluded.For decades, conservatives have seen the American academy as having a liberal and leftist bias.Not only did Mr. Trump place dead last, but his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, leaped into the top 10, coming in 8th ahead of such conservative icons as Ronald Reagan and John Adams and liberal champions such as Lyndon Johnson, John Kennedy and Woodrow Wilson.According to Mr. Rottinghaus and Mr. Vaughn, the two presidents who suffered the sharpest declines since the last survey was taken in 2014 were \u201cBill Clinton, arguably the result of contemporary scorn for his treatment of women, and Andrew Jackson, for evolving attitudes on his treatment of Native Americans.\u201dMr. Clinton dropped from 8th to 13th and Jackson from 9th to 15th.The top seven presidents were the same ones, in the same order, as in 2014 \u2014 Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Franklin Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt, Thomas Jefferson, Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower.On a brighter spot for Republicans, Ronald Reagan broke into the top 10 for the first time, moving from 11th in 2014 to 9th this year.The Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

In addition, 17 people were wounded.\nBut more than a year earlier, documents in the criminal case against Nikolas Cruz and obtained by The Associated Press show school officials and a sheriff\u2019s deputy recommended in September 2016 that Cruz be involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation.\nThe documents, which are part of Cruz\u2019s criminal case in the shooting, show that he had written the word \u201ckill\u201d in a notebook, told a classmate that he wanted to buy a gun and use it, and had cut his arm supposedly in anger because he had broken up with a girlfriend. He also told another student he had drunk gasoline and was throwing up.

Forrest, an Obama appointee to the bench, said the government was following the law when it picked up Ravidath Lawrence Ragbir, the illegal immigrant. But she said there were \u201clarger, more fundamental\u201d rights at stake that were trampled on.\u201cIn sum, the court finds that when this country allowed petitioner to become a part of our community fabric, allowed him to build a life with and among us and to enjoy the liberties and freedom that come with that, it committed itself to allowance of an orderly departure when the time came,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBy denying petitioner these rights, the government has acted wrongly.\u201dShe becomes the latest federal district judge to delve deeply into immigration \u2014 an area Congress has said belongs to the separate immigration court system and to appellate judges, not district judges.Other cases are raging over deportations of Iraqis and Indonesians, with federal judges taking unprecedented steps to stop deportations and rule on individual cases.The Justice Department declined to comment on Monday\u2019s decision.PHOTOS: NFL cheerleaders who became famousJudge Forrest said her ruling doesn\u2019t mean Mr. Ragbir is safe from deportation.He has been ordered removed by an immigration court, and that stands.Immigrant-rights groups said they\u2019re still hoping to fight that, though for now they praised Judge Forrest\u2019s ruling.\u201cRavi and other immigrant rights leaders have been viciously targeted by ICE for speaking out against the injustices of our immigration system. This is a naked attempt to intimidate us into silence, but we will only get louder,\u201d said Steven Choi, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition.Mr. Ragbir was a legal immigrant who earned status in 1994, but who was convicted of loan fraud. After completing his sentence he was turned over to deportation officers for removal.He was in Homeland Security\u2019s custody for nearly two years before being released in 2008 on what\u2019s known as an order of supervision, meaning he was still in loose federal custody.He has been fighting for legal status in the years since, and had been regularly checking in with deportation officials as required by his supervision order.He was told he could be deported at any time once travel documents were obtained, but was told the deportation would be \u201corderly.\u201dIn the meantime, he\u2019s become an immigrant-rights activist, working on a Homeland Security-issued work permit.Earlier this month, Homeland Security ended its yearslong delay of deportation and detained Mr. Ragbir, saying it was going to enforce his deportation.Judge Forrest said immigration has become such a mess, with so many competing agendas, that it\u2019s now \u201ca corn maze\u201d to be navigated.She said the government had correctly read the maze. But she said ruled the outcome unconstitutional.\u201cIt ought not to be \u2014 and it has never before been \u2014 that those who lived without incident in this country for years are subjected to treatment we associate with regimes we revile as unjust, regimes where those who have long lived in a country may be taken without notice from streets, home and work.

Adam B. Schiff of California, Democrats on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence publicly kicked off the investigation on March 20, 2017, by reading a number of unverified Steele charges into the record. No line of inquiry was off limits, including Mr. Steele\u2019s story about President Trump and prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room in 2013.\nMr. Steele wrote of an \u201cextensive conspiracy\u201d between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Mr. Trump has called the former British spy\u2019s dossier a collection of fiction. In an April court filing, Mr. Steele backed off his strongest claims and talked only of \u201cpossible coordination.\u201d\nSince March 20, as testimony about suspected collusion went into the recesses of the U.S. Capitol\u2019s sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF, pronounced skiff), Democrats began a pattern of leaking to favored media, sometimes as a witness was still testifying.\nAfter a recent leak, Rep. Lee M. Zeldin, New York Republican, tweeted: \u201cHoly cow. The leaks coming from Dems on HouseIntelComm are out of control! Witnesses come in for hours of testimony at a time  then Dems instantly leak their version of 1 question  that\u2019s that. Do rules, confidentiality  process matter at all anymore?\u201d\nMr. Trump and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders have bluntly accused Mr. Schiff of spoon-feeding the press confidential anti-Trump material. Mr. Trump told The Wall Street Journal in January that when Mr. Schiff leaves a committee interview, a news report on the testimony quickly follows.\nMr. Schiff denies he is leaking.\n\u201cThey owe me an apology, but frankly it would be a wasted errand to ask for one,\u201d Mr. Schiff said on CNN. \u201cAnd if Sarah Huckabee Sanders is going to have to give out apologies to everyone that he has criticized unfairly, she would be doing nothing else all day.\u201d\nAfter Mr. Trump called him a \u201ctotal phony,\u201d and \u201cleakin\u2019 monster,\u201d Mr. Schiff tweeted back: \u201cWait a minute, Mr. President. Am I a phony or sleazy, a monster or little? Surely you know the key to a good playground nickname is consistency. I thought you were supposed to be good at this.\u201d\nA review of committee press coverage shows that more than two dozen leaks appear to be Democrat-generated. At least five were inaccurate, two decidedly wrong.\nRepublicans appear to have leaked a smattering of testimony stories favorable to Mr. Trump. Democrats have accused Republicans of leaking private text messages between Sen. Mark R. Warner, Virginia Democrat, and Adam Waldman, a Washington lawyer attempting to negotiate a meeting with Mr. Steele.\nFive Democrat leaks that Republicans say missed the mark:\n\u2022 CNN reported that emails from presidential son Donald Trump Jr., who was testifying that day, show he received a tipoff from WikiLeaks days before the anti-secrecy group dispensed more stolen Democratic Party emails. The story stayed active a full day before CNN corrected it to say the tipoff came after the public release.\nMr. Trump Jr.\u2019s attorney strongly implied that Democrats purposely injected an inaccurate leak into the Trump-Russia debate.\n\u2022 CNN and other news sites reported erroneous Democratic versions of data on Russian-bought Facebook advertising. Democrats leaked in October to CNN that the ads targeted Michigan, Wisconsin and other swing states. The message was clear: Russians made the difference in handing Mr. Trump two pivotal states to win 270 electoral votes.\nBut the Washington Examiner looked at numbers and messages and concluded that the ads designed to stir unrest were written awkwardly. Sen. Richard Burr, North Carolina Republican and chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued numbers that showed deep-blue Maryland received more Facebook ads than Wisconsin, with 262 and 55 respectively. No Wisconsin ad mentioned Mr. Trump.\n\u2022 The Daily Beast reported that Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, refused to deny a charge from Democrats that he collaborated with the White House on his blockbuster memo. It detailed abuses by the FBI in obtaining a wiretap on Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page.\nThe committee later released a transcript of the business meeting that showed Mr. Nunes had vigorously denied that he worked with White House. The conservative news website The Federalist wrote: \u201cOnce again, reporters got burned by believing anonymous Democrats [on the House committee].\u201d\n\u2022 The New York Times ballyhooed a leak that said White House communications director Hope Hicks admitted to telling \u201cwhite lies\u201d during nine hours of testimony. Her admission was in answer to a Democrat\u2019s question about whether she had ever been untruthful, even to the point of telling white lies. She said sometimes, such as in telling a caller that Mr. Trump was not in when he was.\n\u2022 Democrats leaked that Ms. Hicks said two of her email accounts \u2014 one personal, the other a campaign address \u2014 had been hacked. Only one personal account, going back to Ms. Hicks\u2019 college days, had been hacked. Republicans said Ms. Hick\u2019s testimony was so inconsequential that Democrats were forced to leak petty asides.\nRepublicans note other piecemeal leaks designed to sully Mr. Trump. Democrats leaked that his personal assistant, Keith Schiller, testified that while Mr. Trump was in Moscow in 2013 for his Miss Universe contest that a Russian offered prostitutes. Mr. Schiller laughed it off. Democrats leaked this small excerpt to spin to reporters that there is credence to the Steele dossier\u2019s section about prostitutes.\nDemocrats also routinely leak the schedules for upcoming witnesses. Their motive, Republicans say, is to make sure the media capture footage of the witnesses as they walk in and out of the panel\u2019s secure hearing room.\nDossier, front and center\nCommittee Democrats early on set the tone for their inquisition.\nWhile the Senate intelligence committee avoids most partisan squabbles, House Democrats went after Mr. Trump from the start. Their weapon: the unverified dossier complied by Mr. Steele, who was paid by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.\nMr. Schiff wholeheartedly endorsed the information and its author, Mr. Steele. He was joined by the panel\u2019s most liberal wing: Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, Rep. Jackie Speier of California, Joaquin Castro of Texas and Andre Carson of Indiana.\nA year later, the dossier\u2019s core charges remain unconfirmed by the FBI. After scouring millions of pages of documents and interviewing scores of witnesses, Mr. Nunes has said there was no Russia-Trump collusion.\nThe final word will come from special counsel Robert Mueller, who continues to call Trump people to testify and wants to interview the president.\nAt the March 20 hearing, Mr. Steele was the witness in absentia as Democrats read his charges and tried to coax agreement from then-FBI Director James B. Comey and Navy Adm. Mike Rogers, director of the National Security Agency.\nSaid Mr. Carson: \u201cIn fact, the dossier written by former MI6 agent Christopher Steele alleges that Trump agreed to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue, which is effectively a priority for [Russian President] Vladimir Putin. There\u2019s a lot in the dossier that is yet to be proven, but increasingly as we\u2019ll hear throughout the day, allegations are checking out. And this one seems to be as accurate as they come.\u201d\nWhen Adm. Rogers said it is possible the Kremlin would trade favors for intelligence from foreigners, Mr. Castro concluded, \u201cOK. Well, the dossier definitely seems right on these points. A quid pro quo relationship seems to exist between the Trump campaign and Putin\u2019s Russia.\u201d\nMr. Schiff embraced Mr. Steele\u2019s narration of a trip to Moscow in July 2016 by Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page. Mr. Steele\u2019s sources said Mr. Page met with two Kremlin figures who offered bribes for sanctions relief.\nMr. Page has denied under oath to Congress that he met the two men or discussed bribes.\nMr. Steele said Mr. Page was offered a brokerage fee of Russian oil giant Rosneft\u2019s planned sale of a 19 percent stake to private investors.\nMr. Schiff credited Mr. Steele with predicting the 19 percent figure in an October memo in a sale that happened two months later: \u201cIs it a coincidence that the Russian gas company, Rosneft, sold a 19 percent share after former British intelligence officer Steele was told by Russian sources that Carter Page was offered fees on a deal of just that size?\u201d\nBut a check of the internet shows that Moscow announced the 19 percent figure the previous July. The 19 percent was public knowledge when Mr. Steele wrote his memo.\nMonths after the March 20 hearing, Democrats continued to pursue the Steele stories as they questioned witnesses, according to three testimony transcripts released at the request of the witness.\nThere is the far-fetched tale that Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal attorney, secretly traveled to Prague in August 2016 to meet with Putin aides and devise a cover-up for the hacking of Democratic Party computers.\nMr. Cohen has testified under oath that he never went to Prague or engaged in any cover-up of Russian hacking.\nBut Mr. Schiff and others have persisted. Glenn Simpson, a co-founder of Fusion GPS, who paid Mr. Steele, suggested in testimony that Mr. Cohen could have traveled to Prague on a yacht and a Russian plane.\nAfter testimony, Democrats have sometimes accused Trump witnesses of lying, without specifics.\nMs. Speier accused former Trump campaign adviser Michael Caputo of lying after his testimony but gave no details. He filed a complaint with the House Committee on Ethics.\nThe Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

Mr. Soros loves the establishment and the deep state because he is one of them. He was a co-chair of the Ready for Hillary PAC\u2019s finance panel and is a longtime comrade of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Mr. Soros funded resistance against Mr. Trump before the election (Remember the Trump rally in Chicago that had to be canceled due to violent protests in the streets?), and he continues to do so across the country.Mr. Soros\u2018 money has been traced to the #Resist movement, including funding to #disrupt the presidential inauguration. (Perhaps Americans should consider anew the definitions of sedition and treason?)But with every Soros-sponsored, ranting feminist march and radical protest designed to incite racial divides, attentive Americans are beginning to realize that the leftists are so intent on gaining power that they are even willing to tear our nation apart and pit neighbor against neighbor.Mr. Soros also spends millions of dollars to advance his open borders and illegal migration in order to achieve a \u201cpermanent progressive majority.\u201d Of course, this means promoting amnesty, giving noncitizens the right to vote and doing away with voter verification.Mr. Soros knows that hardworking, freedom-loving Americans want to protect our country and individual freedom. His goal is to bring in as many people from the outside as possible and make them dependent on our government so they will always be willing to cast their votes for liberal and leftist politicians who care more about power than they do about helping people become independent.For confusing optics and sound bites, Mr. Soros even \u201crents\u201d leftist \u201cministers,\u201d like Sojourners founder Jim Wallis.

Winer, who was former secretary state John Kerry\u2019s special envoy to Libya and his Senate adviser, disclosed the the behind-the-scenes get-Trump operation in a Washington Post op-ed on Friday.Mr. Winer confirmed a redacted Senate report released on Tuesday that said information on candidate Trump flowed between Mr. Steele and Clinton operatives, with Mr. Winer as the middleman.Mr. Steele, a former British spy, wrote the anti-Trump dossier with money provided by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, through Fusion GPS.The Hillary Clinton agents are Sidney Blumenthal, a well-known fierce Clinton defender and freelance intelligence gatherer, and his collaborator, Cody Shearer.Mr. Winer\u2019s disclosures mean that, not only was the Hillary Clinton campaign paying Mr. Steele, but her loyalists were also providing raw intelligence that got incorporated into the Steele dossier and went to the FBI.Mr. Winer said he shared the dossier charges in a two-page summary with career diplomat Victoria Nuland who said she planned to share it with Mr. Kerry.The Senate document, prepared by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, Iowa Republican, said two reports came from State (apparently Mr. Winer) to Mr. Steele from Blumenthal-Shearer. Their source was a \u201cforeign-sub-source.\u201dMr. Steele paid intermediaries to collect his unverified attacks from Kremlin sources on Mr. Trump and associates.Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, has announce he will next investigate the dossier roles of the State Department and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s operatives.To date, his investigation into FBI and Department of Justice abuses has turned up a series of new disclosures.He found out who financed the discredited dossier. It alleges a still-unconfirmed \u201cextensive conspiracy\u201d between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin to interfere in the 2016 election.Mr. Nunes also discovered that the FBI used the partisan dossier to convince a judge to issue a wiretap warrant on Trump volunteer Carter Page. He disclosed that the FBI cited a Yahoo News story as corroboration when in fact it too came from the dossier.He further found that the FBI planned to pay Mr. Steele to continue investigating the candidate who came to be President Trump. The FBI suspended the relationship after Mr. Steele went to the press with his allegations days before the Nov. 8 election.The Senate report is Mr. Grassley\u2019s criminal referral asking the Justice Department to investigate Mr. Steele for lying to the FBI. The referral said Mr. Steele  assured the FBI he did not talk to Yahoo News when in fact he did.Mr. Grassley\u2019s referral confirms Mr. Nunes\u2019 findings and contains new dossier information. Mr. Steele wrote an Oct. 19 memo based on the Winer-Blumenthal-Shearer connection. It was not part of the 35-page dossier posted on Jan 10, 2017 by BuzzFeed.The FBI heavily redacted the memo so there are few details. But the three names appeared in an earlier Grassley letter to the DNC asking for any communications between them.Mr. Winer\u2019s op-ed said that Mr. Shearer came up with some of the same salacious allegations as did Mr. Steele.Mr. Winer said he had accepted Mr. Steele\u2019s previous foreign policy reports and has been an \u201cold friend\u201d of Mr. Blumenthal for decades.\u201cBlumenthal and I discussed Steele\u2019s reports,\u201d Mr. Winer wrote. \u201cHe showed me notes gathered by a journalist I did not know, Cody Shearer, that alleged the Russians had compromising information on Trump of a sexual and financial nature. What struck me was how some of the material echoed Steele\u2019s but appeared to involve different sources.\u201dMr. Steele had contacted Mr. Winer in what the Senate report, quoting an associate, described as his \u201cdesperate\u201d effort to defeat Mr. Trump.Mr. Winer wrote, \u201cOn my own, I shared a copy of these notes with Steele, to ask for his professional reaction. He told me it was potentially \u2018collateral\u2019 information. I asked him what that meant. He said that it was similar but separate from the information he had gathered from his sources. I agreed to let him keep a copy of the Shearer notes.\u201dMr. Steele\u2019s dossier includes the un-substantiated charge that Mr. Trump entertained prostitutes in a Moscow hotel in 2013. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denied this.

Of that, just $2.3 billion was clawed back, leaving $3.5 billion in outstanding excess payments.\u201cThe overpayments were that much?\u201d said Rep. Phil Roe, Tennessee Republican.He said he is trying to expand an assistance program for older veterans and their caregivers. \u201cI can think of a lot of things I can use $3.5 billion dollars for,\u201d he said.Most Obamacare exchange customers receive taxpayer-funded subsidies to help cover their premiums.The amount they receive is based on their expected earnings. At the end of the year, they are supposed to reconcile what they anticipated with what they actually earned. Because some received higher incomes \u2014 through raises, promotions or better jobs \u2014 they have to repay the IRS.But authors of the 2010 law were afraid that the threat of a big tax bill would discourage people from buying Obamacare coverage altogether, so they set limits on the amount of money the government could claw back.Those limits have been tweaked over the years because Congress feared it was giving away unearned money.The $3.5 billion figure told lawmakers that they are still leaving a lot of money on the table. The 2017 figure is more than five times the number from 2015, which was the first tax year after Obamacare was fully operational.Assuming similar overages for the rest of the decade, the $35 billion would be more than enough to pay for President Trump\u2019s border wall trust fund, with money left over to cover an anti-opioid effort.\u201cThat begins to get to be a lot of money,\u201d said Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, Oregon Republican.Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director, said he is not sure why the amounts spiked in the latest reported year, though it might be because of income growth. In other words, people underestimated their income before their earnings rose in a good economic climate, so they received more taxpayer assistance than they should have.Others explained the big numbers by pointing to subsidy payments that have been rising with soaring premiums on the economically shaky exchanges or by suggesting that some consumers figured out how to game the system.\u201cThere may be some strategic behavior involved, with some people intentionally underestimating their income with the expectation that they will not have to pay back excess credits beyond the cap,\u201d said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University. \u201cBut estimating income for people with seasonal or hourly pay jobs is very difficult, and expecting people to revise their income estimates every month, with corresponding revisions in their premium payments, is not realistic.\u201dFor that reason, Obamacare defenders warn against being too harsh on customers. They say it doesn\u2019t make sense to repeal the caps and demand full repayment of excessive subsidies.\u201cThere are tips people get that are hard to predict, there\u2019s holiday pay \u2014 there are many reasons people might have done their best but gotten an overpayment,\u201d said Cheryl Fish-Parcham, director of access initiatives for Families USA, a consumer group that advocates for affordable health care.Under Obamacare, the subsidy money goes straight to insurers, though the customers are responsible for returning overpayments. Once they hit the repayment cap, however, the extra money amounts to a taxpayer-funded benefit they don\u2019t deserve.Republicans say allowing people to keep benefits to which they aren\u2019t entitled adds to their case against Obamacare.\u201cThat\u2019s just yet one more absurdity in the Affordable Care Act. It makes no sense,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy, Louisiana Republican.He said education, public safety, infrastructure and defense could use the money instead. \u201cMaybe \u2014 God forbid, don\u2019t faint dead away \u2014 we could actually give some of it back to the taxpayers,\u201d he said.The House passed an Obamacare replacement that would have recaptured all of the excess subsidy during a multiyear transition period from the current program to a Republican system. But the Senate discarded the bill, and the repeal push faltered amid Democratic opposition and defections from three Republicans.A White House official said Wednesday that the inability to claw back excess subsidy is outrageous and should be remedied, though analysts say any attempt to scrap the cap would likely run into a Democratic filibuster in the Senate.Senate Finance Committee spokeswoman Julia Lawless said Chairman Orrin G. Hatch, Utah Republican, \u201chas consistently supported congressional efforts to claw back Obamacare\u2019s overpayments.\u201d\u201cWhile past efforts have been blocked by Senate Democrats, the chairman is continuing to talk to members on how this can be best addressed,\u201d she said.It\u2019s unclear if the forfeited dollars exceed what Congress should have expected or what future years might hold. A spokeswoman for the Congressional Budget Office, which evaluates the likely fiscal impact of legislation, said it hasn\u2019t studied the issue.As it stands, subsidized customers must pay back no more than $1,275 \u2014 $2,500 for families \u2014 although repayments among low and midrange earners are capped at $300 and $750 ($600 and $1,500 for families), respectively.The law was originally far more generous, capping the amount the government could claw back at $250 for individuals and $400 for families.But Congress has twice passed bills raising the caps, freeing up more money to spend on other bipartisan initiatives: First in 2010, as part of the annual \u201cdoc fix\u201d to stave off cuts to Medicare reimbursements for doctors, and then again in 2011 to pay for repeal of Obamacare\u2019s unpopular 1099 provision, which would have required businesses to fill out a tax form every time they paid a vendor $600 or more.Mr. Jost said the amount forfeited through Obamacare is still a \u201cdrop in the bucket\u201d compared with the hundreds of billions of dollars that fall into the \u201ctax gap\u201d created by individuals and business that underpay taxes overall.\u201cIf Congress is serious about making sure people pay their taxes,\u201d he said, \u201cit would dramatically increase funding for IRS audits for people who are currently cheating on their taxes and getting away with it \u2014 and they are not primarily poor people.\u201d\n                 LOAD COMMENTS ()\n              HIDE COMMENTS", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Stephen Dinan", "body": "President Trump will propose a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrant \u201cDreamers,\u201d nearly tripling the Obama-era DACA program, the White House said Thursday as it previewed the plan the president will submit to Congress next week.Mr. Trump\u2019s vision is less than the 3 million people granted legal status under the plan pushed by Sens. Lindsey Graham and Richard Durbin, but far more than the 690,000 people currently in the DACA program.White House officials said they felt they had to go that far in order to demand major changes on the security side, including the end to catch-and-release of illegal immigrants at the border, faster deportations for children and families, Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall and strict limits on the chain of family migration across the board.Mr. Trump wants to limit the chain only to spouses and minor children, eliminating parents, siblings and adult children. Those already in the backlog would be allowed to enter, but no future applications would be accepted from extended family.Combining the legalization and the security puts Mr. Trump squarely in the middle of the immigration debate, between Democrats who want the most generous amnesty and House Republicans who opposed citizenship and were instead pushing a massive package of security changes.\u201cAs part of this effort to ensure there is full bipartisan support for this package, we believe the total number that will be able to apply for legal status \u2026 will be a population of individuals of 1.8 million people,\u201d a senior White House official said.The official said there couldn\u2019t be a deal on Dreamers without the border security, enforcement and policy changes.\u201cThis is kind of a bottom line for the president,\u201d another official told reporters at the White House.The plan calls for a $25 billion trust fund to be created to build Mr. Trump\u2019s wall and other infrastructure. That would ensure the money can\u2019t be withheld by a future Congress.Mr. Obama had supported a path to citizenship for Dreamers, but was unable to get that legislation through Congress, which is why his administration went around Capitol Hill to create the DACA program.Begun in 2012, it approved some 800,000 people for renewable two-year permits granting them a stay of deportation and authority to work in the U.S. Of those people, some 690,000 were still protected under DACA as of late last year.The additional 1.1 million people Mr. Trump would enroll about 600,000 people who were eligible for DACA but, for various reasons, didn\u2019t apply, and another 500,000 or so who would be admitted under adjusted timelines.The White House called the 1.8 million \u201ca dramatic concession by the White House to get to 60 votes in the Senate.\u201dIt would take between 10 and 12 years to earn citizenship.Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, said the president had embraced an \u201camnesty\u201d that even President Obama didn\u2019t get.\u201cI do not believe we should be granting a path to citizenship to anybody here illegally,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of these proposals being floated that have a path to citizenship for DACA recipients are markedly to the left of where President Obama was. DACA itself has no path to citizenship under President Obama\u2019s illegal executive amnesty.\u201dDemocrats, meanwhile, remained skeptical of Mr. Trump\u2019s support for citizenship, which he announced to reporters on Wednesday.\u201cWhat he says on Tuesday is not to necessarily what he says on Thursday,\u201d said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.Still, Sen. Michael Bennet, Colorado Democrat, said the president\u2019s move toward citizenship for Dreamers was \u201cencouraging.\u201d\u201cI think there is a general consensus among people working on this that a pathway has to be part of it,\u201d he said.The White House\u2019s new plan could undercut efforts by House conservatives, who back a much tougher security plan. That would grant the 690,000 people now under DACA a new legal status of three-year work permits, approved by Congress, in exchange for mandatory use of E-Verify for businesses to check their employees\u2019 work status; curtailing abuse of the asylum system; cracking down on sanctuary cities; and punishing repeat-illegal immigrants.The White House said it envisioned Mr. Trump\u2019s plan as the basis for Senate negotiations, but said they anticipate the House operating on a separate path.\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to force something on the House at this point, I think the House has got its own independent process,\u201d an adviser said.\n                 LOAD COMMENTS ()\n              HIDE COMMENTS", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Dave Boyer", "body": "The White House confirmed Tuesday night that President Trump has asked the Pentagon to arrange a grand military parade in Washington to showcase the pride and valor of U.S. armed forces, possibly on Independence Day.\u201cPresident Trump is incredibly supportive of America\u2019s great service members who risk their lives every day to keep our country safe,\u201d said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. \u201cHe has asked the Department of Defense to explore a celebration at which all Americans can show their appreciation.\u201dThe idea of soldiers and tanks rolling down the avenues of the nation\u2019s capital came to Mr. Trump during a visit to Paris last year, when French President Emmanuel Macron treated his guest to a grand military parade.

The friction began when Mr. Sessions recused himself from all matters relating to the Russia investigation, which is now being handled by special prosecutor Robert Mueller.\nHis recusal has continued to cause tensions within the administration.\nThe alleged abuses in the FISA warrant system came to light when Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee released a memo saying FBI agents did not tell the judge in the secret court system that the unverified dossier, which they claim was used to obtain the warrant, was politically funded. The warrant was obtained to collect information on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page for his ties to Russian and claims of possible collusion.\nDemocrats pushed back on this in their own memo arguing that the warrant was not entirely substantiated from the dossier and that the judge knew it had political ties. Some on the committee, however, acknowledged it\u2019s unlikely the court knew it was funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\nThe memos on the surveillance warrant were both published against the wishes of the FBI, who said the documents could reveal sources and methods for obtaining the top-secret information.

They emerged to accuse the president of racism for highlighting black families whose teens were slain by MS-13 gang members.\u201cFrom his racist, demonizing comments on immigrants to the complete lack of any mention in relation to securing our democracy from the Russian government, the speech wasn\u2019t new, it wasn\u2019t good and it won\u2019t change any fundamental dynamics of our nation moving forward,\u201d said Rep.

That is it? That is not a positive and optimistic agenda. They are just running on Trump hatred, and it manifests itself in everything they say or do, including in Nancy Pelosi\u2019s scowling face.\u201dHe said Democrats could end up as their own worst enemies.\u201cRepublicans are not in a good place, but the only thing that could stop the wave is Democrats themselves,\u201d Mr. Sheridan said. \u201cThey have no message. They have no policy agenda other than \u2018We hate Donald Trump.\u2019\u201dThe potential pitfalls of going all in against Mr. Trump were illustrated in a Monmouth University poll released Wednesday that showed public support for the tax overhaul that Democrats have written off as a giveaway to the rich is on the rise \u2014 as is Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating, which jumped 10 percentage points to 42 percent.\u201cIt looks like the needle has moved in the Republicans\u2019 direction since passage of the tax bill,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute.Republicans also are betting that Democrats could end up regretting aligning themselves with the \u201cresistance movement\u201d and Hollywood types when it comes to the debate over young illegal immigrants known as Dreamers.Democrats have balked at Mr. Trump\u2019s offer to provide a path to citizenship for 1.8 million of them \u2014 which would nearly triple the size of the program under President Obama \u2014 in exchange for, among other things, $25 billion for a border wall.At a \u201cPeople\u2019s State of the Union\u201d this week in New York, actor Mark Ruffalo sported a T-shirt that said, \u201cWe are all Dreamers.\u201dDemocrats\u2019 biggest outlier Tuesday was Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, who applauded Mr. Trump\u2019s address more than any of his Democratic colleagues.Considered one of the more vulnerable Democrats up for re-election, Mr. Manchin on Wednesday said he heard some good things from Mr. Trump, such as addressing the opioid epidemic and advancing \u201cclean coal\u201d technology.\u201cThe president\u2019s laid out some things that I can work with,\u201d Mr. Manchin said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201dThe State of the Union address and other presidential appearances before joint sessions of Congress have evolved into venues for lawmakers to try to score points with constituents and activists tuning in across the country.They also have become more partisan, leading to some major breaches of decorum. In 2009, Rep. Joe Wilson, South Carolina Republican, yelled, \u201cYou Lie!\u201d at President Obama.On Tuesday, Democrats set a stiff anti-Trump tone early on when they failed to give a hearty welcome to first lady Melania Trump in the chamber.During most of the speech, Democratic leaders \u2014 including Mrs. Pelosi \u2014 sat stone-faced through the president\u2019s calls for action.\u201cI think Nancy Pelosi looks like that all the time,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on CNN. \u201cI think she should smile a lot more often. I think the country would be better for it. She seems to kind of embody the bitterness that belongs in the Democrat Party right now.\u201dThe most dour group on Tuesday, though, was the all-Democrat Congressional Black Caucus, which refused to cheer Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that black unemployment is at a record low and later accused Mr. Trump of trying to steal credit for the strong economy he inherited from Mr. Obama last year.\u201cThe Congressional Black Caucus can now answer the question he posed to the African-American community in 2016 with 100 percent certainty: African-Americans have a lot to lose under the Trump administration, and we have lost a lot already, especially when it comes to his justice, voting rights, education, housing and health care policies,\u201d said Rep. Cedric L. Richmond, the Louisiana Democrat who leads the group.In a press briefing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Mrs. Pelosi said the nation deserves a \u201creal leader\u201d and that Mr. Trump showed once again why people should not have high expectations for his presidency.\u201cHe stooped to a new low in terms of how he dealt with issues,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi said.House Minority Whip Steny H.

Hallow", "body": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:\nPresident Trump\u2019s firing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was crude, rude and way overdue.\nThe president, not the president\u2019s chief of staff, should have been the first to inform Mr. Tillerson personally and in private, that he is getting the heave-ho. Mr. Trump should have let him have time to prepare his own face-saving announcement.\nBut more important, the former ExxonMobil chairman should never have agreed to serve in this administration in the first place, given his dislike of so much of what Mr. Trump ran on.\nAnd given Mr. Tillerson\u2019s inability to subordinate his views to those of his boss, the only one of the two whom Americans elected to conduct foreign policy. The president appointed Mr. Tillerson to carry out the president\u2019s foreign policy, not Mr. Tillerson\u2018s.\nIt\u2019s astounding that the former CEO of world\u2019s biggest oil company doesn\u2019t understand the constitutional role of a secretary of state. The only policy role of the occupant of that office is to offer his own policy advice to the president, in private, and then carry out whatever the president decides without mumbles, grumbles or winces.\nWhy?\nFor the sake of the American government\u2019s credibility, abroad and at home. The only reason foreign governments pay any attention to the U.S. secretary of state is that they are convinced he speaks for the president.\nThat belief faltered almost immediately.\nAs a candidate, Mr. Trump made it clear to all but the terminally stupid that he would tear up the Iran nuclear deal if elected.\nOnce sworn in, Mr. Tillerson committed the unforgivable sin of publicly disagreeing with Mr. Trump on this. \u201cHe and I have differences of views on things like [the Iran deal] and how we should use it,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said.\nMr. Trump was unwise to appoint a man so at odds with the president on so important an issue, but Mr. Tillerson had no excuse for disputing his boss publicly. That moment would have been a good time for Mr. Trump to whisper \u201cyou\u2019re fired.\u201d\nThe belief that the State Department speaks for the president also faltered after four Arab countries severed relations with a fifth, Qatar, for its funding terrorism, Mr. Tillerson urged all five to settle differences in order to get on with the fight against terrorism. Mr. Trump sided publicly with the four against Qatar. This was not a good-bad cop tactic but sloppy message coordination by the administration.\nYou can\u2019t have the secretary of state and the president publicly disagreeing. It diminished the seriousness with which foreign governments take the pronouncements, policy statements and, yes, the threats uttered by U.S. government.\nIn this case, Mr. Trump should have cooled his twitter finger. He should have quietly persuaded Mr. Tillerson to resort to diplo-speak to establish in subsequent statements that he really agrees with Mr. Trump and always has on Qatar. Either that or resign.\nThe fault lies, unequally, with both men. Mr. Tillerson should have cleared his Qatar view with Mr. Trump before going public. Mr. Trump should have resolved the situation privately with Mr. Tillerson.\nLast summer, Mr. Trump yanked the U.S. out of the Obama-approved Paris climate accord. Mr. Tillerson publicly disagreed.\nA secretary of state less full of himself would have resigned. A president less loath to pull the trigger would have eased Mr. Tillerson back into private life right then and there.\nAgain last summer, Mr. Trump said of the Afghanistan war, \u201cOur troops will fight to win. We will fight to win. From now on, victory will have a clear definition: attacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing Al Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan, and stopping mass terror attacks against America before they emerge.\u201d\nMr. Tillerson addressed the Taliban this way: \u201cYou will not win a battlefield victory. We may not win one, but neither will you. So at some point, we have to come to the negotiating table and find a way to bring this to an end.\u201d\nNothing wrong with the Tillerson statement \u2014 if he had the common sense to have uttered it privately and solely to Mr. Trump.\nMr. Tillerson never revealed such common sense.

Bates seemed skeptical, prodding government lawyers on what he suggested was questionable legal reasoning by the Justice Department and thin justifications from Homeland Security.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t that much in the agency decision,\u201d the judge, appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, told the government.\nHe repeatedly asked lawyers what would happen if he were to send the phaseout decision back to the department to try again.\nBoth sides agreed that depending on how the judge wrote that decision, it could mean kick-starting the DACA program again. That would mean not only taking renewal applications \u2014 which the department is already doing, thanks to two other judges\u2019 orders \u2014 but even allowing perhaps tens of thousands of brand new Dreamers to sign up for DACA.\nJudge Bates is just the latest court to consider the phaseout. Two other federal judges in California and New York have ruled the phaseout illegal, while one in Maryland ruled it legal.\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke announced the phaseout Sept. 5, citing a letter from Mr. Sessions that told her to rescind DACA because it lacked legal backing.\nIn his letter, Mr. Sessions said DACA \u201cwas an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the executive branch.\u201d He pointed to a ruling by a federal appeals court in 2015 that found a similar deportation amnesty for millions of additional illegal immigrants \u2014 a program called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans.\n\u201cBecause the DACA policy has the same legal and constitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA, it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar results with respect to DACA,\u201d Mr. Sessions said.\nBut Judge Bates said that was wrong. He said while courts had ruled DAPA was illegal because it cut procedural corners, no court had ruled it unconstitutional.\n\u201cSo the attorney general is not correct\u201d on how the 5th Circuit judges ruled, Judge Bates demanded of Kathryn C. Davis, a Justice Department lawyer.\nShe concurred: \u201cIt was an error to assert they reached a constitutional issue.\u201d\nJudge Bates isn\u2019t the first to call Mr. Sessions on the error in the memo.\nThe federal judge in New York who ruled against the phaseout last month also said Mr. Sessions got the legal issues wrong.\nThe Justice Department is appealing that ruling, and in briefs filed last week government lawyers said the mistake was \u201cplainly harmless.\u201d\nThe government said Ms. Duke would have gone through with the phaseout based on the rest of the information she saw beyond Mr. Sessions\u2019 letter, including the 5th Circuit\u2019s DAPA ruling and threats by conservative states to sue over DACA.\nIn a statement to The Washington Times after Wednesday\u2019s hearing, the Justice Department said Mr. Sessions\u2019 letter was intended to reflect his own legal conclusions.\n\u201cRead in its entirety, the attorney general\u2019s letter should not be interpreted as attributing constitutional holdings to the Texas courts, but rather as invoking the legal grounds they adopted in support of his own view that DACA was unconstitutional,\u201d the department said. \u201cAs the department of Justice correctly explained at argument, DACA violates separation of powers principles because the executive branch is taking action that Congress had chosen not to allow.\u201d\nLegal analysts have faulted the government\u2019s approach to defending the phaseout in courts.\nJosh Blackman, an associate professor at the South Texas College of Law, has called parts of Mr. Sessions\u2019 letter \u201cconfounding,\u201d and has written that the Justice Department isn\u2019t arguing it properly in the cases.\nMr. Blackman also wondered why the Justice Department has not rescinded an Office of Legal Counsel opinion issued in 2014 declaring DACA and DAPA legal.\nJudge Bates wondered the same thing, saying he\u2019d been looking in either Mr. Sessions\u2019 or Ms. Duke\u2019s documents for an explanation of why they were ignoring the OLC.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not there,\u201d he said.\nThe Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

The charges stemmed from his stonewalling and lying to Congress as he scrambled to keep investigators away from any evidence that might link a major Obama administration scandal directly to the White House.\nMaybe that\u2019s what a president\u2019s \u201cwing man\u201d does and Mr. Obama certainly got protection from Mr. Holder whenever he needed it.  Mr. Holder has actually always been prone to confusing loyalty to the law and to his boss for decades.\nAfter serving as a U.S. attorney, he moved to main Justice as deputy attorney general during the Clinton years and was key to Mr. Clinton\u2019s pardon of billionaire fugitive Marc Rich just before he left office. The New York Times called the Rich pardon \u201ca shocking abuse of presidential power.\u201d\nMarc Rich made much of his money by illegally buying $200 million dollars\u2019 worth of embargoed Iranian oil while that country was holding 53 Americans hostage. He made secret and incredibly profitable deals with the apartheid regime in South Africa and the totalitarian governments of Libya and North Korea, and when indicted, owed the U.S. some $48 million in taxes.\nMr. Rich and his cronies were major contributors to the Bill Clinton machine and many believed that they bought Mr. Rich the pardon President Clinton signed just before turning the Oval Office over to George W. Bush in 2001.\nThe president has the authority to issue pardons on his own, but virtually all pardons come only after consultations with Justice Department officials and the prosecutors who bring the charges in the first place. Justice or anyone in the building save Mr. Holder would have opposed the Rich pardon had they known it was in the works, but Mr. Holder, then serving as Mr. Clinton\u2019s wing man, kept them all out of the loop for more than two months until it was a fait accompli.\nThe outrage at Mr. Holder\u2019s role in the pardon scandal shook him so badly that he told a Washington Post reporter \u201cI\u2019m done. Public life is over for me,\u201d adding that all he wanted to do was \u201ccrawl into bed and pull the covers up over my head.\u201d The country would have been better off had he done so, but it was not to be.\nLooking for his own \u201cwing man\u201d in 2009, President Barack Obama resurrected Mr. Holder over the objections of fellow liberals like columnist Richard Cohen who were appalled at his role in the Rich pardon. Mr. Obama sent Mr. Holder right back to Justice to cover for him the way he had for Mr. Clinton.\nIn no time the Justice Department with Mr. Holder at the helm dropped a lawsuit against the New Black Panther Party for voter intimidation, refused to prosecute  Lois Lerner when it was revealed that her division of the IRS was targeting Tea Party and other conservative organizations for ideological and political reasons, and blocked the \u201cFast  Furious\u201d gun walking investigation that resulted in more than 60 deaths and earned him his contempt of Congress citation.\nThe former attorney general confided to those tuning in over the weekend that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is a close friend who has already decided to indict President Donald Trump for obstruction of justice, but is waiting because he doesn\u2019t yet have the evidence yet. That\u2019s certainly the way Mr. Holder\u2019s Justice worked and he no doubt believes Mr. Mueller approaches investigations looking for evidence to support conclusions already reached.\nMr. Trump can only hope that Mr. Mueller takes his job and oath more seriously. Still, if Mr. Holder is the close friend he claims to be his remarks should convince Mr. Mueller that he like the rest of us would certainly be better off if his friend would even at this late date crawl into bed and pull up the covers.\n\u2022 David A.

Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, issued a declassified memo on Feb. 2. It said the FBI relied greatly on Mr. Steele\u2019s discredited Democrat-financed dossier to obtain a surveillance warrant on Mr. Page.\nTo bolster the dossier\u2019s charge that Mr. Page met with two Kremlin figures in Moscow, the FBI cited the Yahoo News article, which said the same thing.\nBut the Nunes memo said the FBI, in its Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act application, wasn\u2019t corroborating the dossier because the Page accusation in Yahoo came from the same source: Mr. Steele.\n\u201cThe Carter Page FISA application also cited extensively a September 23, 2016 Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff, which focuses on Page\u2019s July 2016 trip to Moscow,\u201d the memo states. \u201cThis article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News.\u201d\nMr. Nunes cited Mr. Steele\u2019s testimony, through his attorneys, in a London court case in which he is being sued for libel.\nThen came a Democratic rebuttal from Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, a leading dossier supporter.\nMr. Schiff, the House intelligence committee\u2019s top Democrat, said Republicans failed to \u201ccite evidence that Steele disclosed to Yahoo details included in the FISA warrant, since the British Court filings to which they refer do not address what Steele may have said to Yahoo.\u201d\nThis assertion is important to Democrats. They are trying to bolster the FBI as it pursues collusion charges between the Trump campaign and Russia, and also support Mr. Steele, whose unverified accusations they have repeatedly cited.\nThe two pieces of evidence that say Mr. Steele was in fact the source:\n\u2981 In the London court case, Mr. Steele acknowledged that he came to the U.S. in September 2016 at the request of Fusion GPS, which paid him with Democratic Party money. He met with a number of major news representatives, including The New York Times and The Washington Post as he tried to sell his explosive charges. Included in Mr. Steele\u2019s list of appointments was a meeting with Mr. Isikoff.\nMr. Isikoff subsequently wrote a story that matched the dossier. Both the dossier and the Yahoo story said Mr. Page met with two U.S.-sanctioned Russians, Rosneft oil chief Igor Sechin and Vladimir Putin aide Igor Diveykin. Mr. Isikoff sourced the information not to Mr. Steele but to a \u201cWestern intelligence source.\u201d\nMr. Page, whose trip to Moscow was for a public speech at a university, has repeatedly denied under oath that he met the two men. The former Moscow resident and energy investor has decried the investigation into him, including the nearly one-year-long wiretap, which he says found no wrongdoing.\n\u2981 After Mr. Schiff wrote his rebuttal to the Nunes memo on Jan. 31, Mr. Isikoff, a longtime journalist in Washington with a number of scoops to his credit, posted an edition of his podcast, \u201cSkullduggery,\u201d on Feb. 2. Through the Nunes memo, Mr. Isikoff had just learned and said he was surprised that the FBI relied on his article before the FISA court judge.\nHe told about being summoned by his \u201cold friend,\u201d Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson, to a private room in a Washington hotel to meet the former spy from Britain.\n\u201cSteele tells me an amazing story,\u201d Mr. Isikoff said. \u201cOne of Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy advisers, Carter Page, had flown to Moscow and held private talks with close associates of Vladimir Putin about lifting U.S. sanctions against Russia. And Steele tells me something else that day that gets my attention. He has taken this information to the FBI, and the bureau is very interested. Why were they interested? What did the bureau know that would prompt them to take the next step of launching an investigation into an adviser to the Republican nominee for president?\u201d\nMr. Isikoff subsequently wrote the article that ended up in the FBI\u2019s FISA petition. His podcast sealed the case for Mr. Nunes.\nThis prompts the question: Why did the FBI believe that the dossier section about Mr. Page and the Isikoff article came from collaborating sources?\nThe answer lies in a declassified referral sent to the Justice Department from Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican.\nThe two said the evidence suggests that Mr. Steele lied to the FBI when he denied being the source. They have asked the Justice Department to investigate him.\n\u201cThe FBI repeatedly represented to the court that Mr. Steele told the FBI he did not have unauthorized contacts with the press about the dossier prior to October 2016,\u201d the senators\u2019 referral said. \u201cThe FISA applications make these claims specifically in the context of the September 2106 Yahoo News article. But Mr. Steele has admitted \u2014 publicly before a court of law \u2014 that he did have such contacts with the press at this time and his former business partner Mr. Simpson has confirmed it to the committee.\u201d\nThe referral says that the FBI either submitted false information or \u201cMr. Steele made materially false statements to the FBI when he claimed he provided the dossier information only to his business partner and the FBI.\u201d\nThe Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

But when a bump stock is attached to the weapon, the gun\u2019s recoil is used to \u201cbump\u201d the trigger back to the shooter\u2019s finger, making the gun fire at a much faster rate.\nStephen Paddock, the gunman who killed 58 people and wounded hundreds of others at a Las Vegas country music festival, had at least 12 rifles with bump stocks, according to law enforcement officials.\nMr. Trump ordered the banning of bump stocks six days after a gunman killed 17 people, including 14 students at a high school in Parkland, Florida, while armed with an AR-15 assault rifle. The shooting has sparked yet another national conversation on the issue of gun control.\nThe National Rifle Association has supported bump stock regulation, but has not endorsed Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed ban, saying it was waiting review any rule changes.\nMr. Sessions made the announcement one day before thousands of school children and others are expected to rally on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. for stricter gun laws. The \u201cMarch For Our Lives\u201d will be led by survivors of the\u00a0Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School\u00a0shooting on Feb. 14 in Parkland, Florida.\nThe Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

They followed on and eventually conducted a stop at a border checkpoint.The 22-year-old driver admitted to being a scouter for a smuggling crew, and said he\u2019d been informing the other car about Border Patrol operations in the area to help them with their smuggling. The man is currently under DACA protection, the government said.Agents said they determined the man had been part of successful smuggling operations \u201con multiple occasions.\u201dCustoms and Border Protection was shielding his identity.In the other incident a day earlier, agents saw a vehicle stopped on the side of Interstate Highway 5 and decided to take a look. They found three men inside: the driver (a 20-year-old man who\u2019d had DACA status but it had expired) and two illegal immigrants.The driver admitted he was involved in human smuggling, authorities said.Last year Border Patrol agents manning a highway checkpoint in Texas snared two Dreamers in separate smuggling cases.To qualify for the DACA program illegal immigrants must assert they were brought to the U.S. as children and have kept a relatively clean record.Immigrant-smuggling violates the terms of the agreement, as does gang membership or other serious crimes of violence.As of this summer, some 2,139 Dreamers had had their DACA status revoked, out of nearly 800,000 people who\u2019d been approved for the program \u2014 an incredibly low rate of about a quarter of 1 percent.Still, the arrests come at a touchy time in negotiations, with Democrats arguing Dreamers should be granted full citizenship rights and President Trump saying that must be coupled with strict border security and other immigration policy changes.None of the identities of the Dreamers were released in any of the cases.Homeland Security said the active Dreamer in the San Diego smuggling incident is being processed for deportation, while the Dreamer with the expired DACA status is \u201ccurrently being held in federal custody.\u201d\n                 LOAD COMMENTS ()\n              HIDE COMMENTS", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Victor Morton", "body": "The former commander of the Army\u2019s 1st Armored Division doesn\u2019t want to see a French- or Chinese-style military parade on the streets of Washington, saying such events are not in the U.S. military\u2019s DNA.Retired Lt.

Before that it was Democrats furious at the FBI\u2019s handling of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s email failures.In between were a slew of embarrassing text messages from an agent involved in both the Trump and Clinton investigations, revelations of top officials\u2019 partisan ties, and a wave of demotions and ousters.\u201cIf people start looking at the FBI as a political organization the taint will be incredible,\u201d said James Wedick, a 34-year agency veteran who now works as an investigator.Credibility allegations have taken a toll on the bureau. The New York Times last week published a piece from Josh Campbell, a former supervisory special agent who said informants may be less willing to come forward in a terrorist investigation, or a jury may not give an agent testifying at trial the same expectation of truth it once would have.Mr. Campbell wrote the piece to announce he was quitting the FBI in order to take a public role in defending it, blaming President Trump and his allies for unfairly sullying the bureau.\u201cA small number of my current and retired colleagues have said that we should simply keep our heads down until the storm passes. I say this with the greatest respect: They are wrong,\u201d Mr. Campbell wrote. \u201cIf those who know the agency best remain silent, it will be defined by those with partisan agendas.\u201dEx-agents\u2019 disagreements over the cause of the taint spills over into the prescription for fixing it.One agent said the usual oversight process may help restore confidence, while another said it\u2019ll take FBI Director Christopher Wray to step in and fix things. Another agent said it may take a special prosecutor to get to the bottom of the bureau\u2019s behavior.\u201cIt looks to me like some FBI executives violated the law by filing a fraudulent affidavit to spy on an American citizen,\u201d said Mr. Wedick. \u201cThat\u2019s going to warrant a special prosecutor. I don\u2019t see how they avoid this.\u201dIf a special prosecutor is not appointed, Lewis Schiliro, former head of agency\u2019s New York office, suggests using the inspector general to release a comprehensive report on the FBI\u2019s activities.But Sanford Unger, director of the Free Speech Program at Georgetown University and author of a book on the FBI\u2019s history, said a special prosecutor would further politicize the battle over the bureau\u2019s behavor.\u201cAnother line of independent inquiry that is subject to political manipulation is not a good idea,\u201d Mr. Unger said. \u201cTo inject another probe could risk harming the bureau in ways that even Mr. Trump wouldn\u2019t want it harmed.\u201dHe said Mr. Trump could help restore faith in the bureau by cooling his criticisms, which Mr. Unger described as short-term political calculations.\u201cIf you tear down an institution like this you can\u2019t just build it back up next week,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to be careful about tearing down institutions that are the bedrock of our democracy because you will cause irreparable damage to the government that maligned it.\u201dThe latest dent to the bureau came on Friday when a House intelligence committee memo claimed the FBI applied for a FISA warrant to spy on Trump campaign aide Carter Page using the discredited Steele Dossier, a collection of unverified reports which was funded by the Clinton campaign for use against Mr. Trump.\u201cThere was a perception that the FBI had lost its objectivity with how it handled the Hillary Clinton investigation and now the FISA memo just adds to that,\u201d Mr. Schiliro said.Politicians of every stripe, from Mr. Trump on down, insist they aren\u2019t questioning the integrity of the 13,000 agents, 3,100 intelligence analysts and 19,000 other support staff.But the leadership has been in turmoil for months, with Mr. Trump firing then-Director James Comey last year, and Deputy Attorney General Andrew McCabe speeding up his retirement this year amid allegations he slow walked the Clinton email investigation.The inspector general is reviewing why Mr. McCabe, the second-highest-ranking official at the FBI \u201cappeared not to act for about three weeks\u201d after new Clinton emails were discovered just weeks before the election. Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife, Jill, ran for state senate in Virginia and had accepted a campaign contribution of nearly $500,000 from Gov. Terry McCauliffe, Virginia Democrat, who chaired Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign.\u201cWhen I was at the bureau, the question was never \u2018is it wrong?,\u2019 it was \u2018does this look wrong?\u2019\u201d Mr. Wedick said. \u201cIf it didn\u2019t look good you weren\u2019t allowed do that. How McCabe\u2019s wife took that money, given his position, is incredible to me.\u201dThe FBI\u2019s troubles deepened last year when Agent Peter Strzok was revealed to have sent bureau attorney Lisa Page, his alleged mistress, multiple texts in support of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential aspirations, while simultaneously blasting Donald Trump.Mr. Strzok was the agent running the investigation into Mrs. Clinton use of a private email server while Secretary of State and, briefly, a member of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team probing possible links between Russia and Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.The agency\u2019s embarrassment over the situation was heightened last month when it admitted last month that it lost nearly five months worth of texts exchanged between Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page due to \u201cmisconfiguration issues.\u201d It took the FBI\u2019s inspector general to recover the missing texts.\u201cHow does the FBI - with the top cybersecurity technology in the world - go to the microphone and announce the texts are missing?\u201d Mr. Wedick said. \u201cThat just gives everyone an insecure feeling that they have no idea what they are doing.\u201dMr. Schiliro said the bad publicity surrounding the bureau is because of the actions of a few top level officials.\u201cThe working agents are out there every day, doing their job and leaving politics at the door,\u201d Mr. Schiliro said. \u201cBut perhaps Comey and others at the top allowed this continue unimpeded.\u201dJohn Lagito, who spent 20 years at the Bureau, said it\u2019s up to Mr. Comey\u2019s successor to restore confidence.\u201cWray just needs to clean house now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe FBI needs to heal and show everyone who the bad apples are.\u201dMr. Lagito accused Mr. Wray of being slow to act, noting that Mr. McCabe did not leave until allegations of his alleged slow walking the Clinton e-mail investigation surfaced or that Mr. Strzok was transferred only after his texts to Ms. Page were disclosed.\u201cJust the affair allegations, which may or may not be true, would have been enough to have an agent suspended when I was at the bureau,\u201d he said.The former agents believe arrests in high-profile FBI investigations could heal some wounds. But such announcements could take a while and may be overshadowed in the media by the political climate in Washington.\u201cA string of good news will impact the public,\u201d Mr. Schiliro said. \u201cI guarantee you that discussion is going on in the director\u2019s office.\u201d\n                 LOAD COMMENTS ()\n              HIDE COMMENTS", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Rowan Scarborough", "body": "A Republican senator on Monday released an unpublished portion of the infamous Trump-Russia dossier that showed Hillary Clinton associates fed information to the author, former British spy Christopher Steele.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairmen Charles Grassley posted the heavily redacted referral he sent to the Justice Department asking for a criminal probe into whether Mr. Steele lied to the FBI.In the referral is a reference to an Oct. 19, 2016 memo Mr. Steele wrote.

Constitutional rights and civil liberties be damned if they get in the way of a phony political hitjob against a political opponent!And in case anyone wondered whether former FBI Director James B. Comey had a shred of integrity left, he settled the issue with a tweet.\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d he inquired. Of the memo that explained how Obama justice officials used Russian-manufactured propaganda paid for by Democrats and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign to apply for a warrant to spy on a private citizen working for the campaign of then-candidate Donald Trump.Yeah, that was it, Jimmy Boy. The fact you are not shocked and outraged by it all only reveals just how thoroughly corrupted you have become.Still, people who read the memo are standing around scratching their heads trying to figure out what \u201csources and methods\u201d might have actually been revealed by the publication of the memo.Best they can come up with is a Yahoo News story based on information leaked from the Kremlin-backed, U.S. Democrat-funded \u201cDirty Dossier\u201d that was used \u2014 at least in part, according to the Republican memo \u2014 to obtain a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant to spy on a low-level Trump campaign adviser.Now was this a \u201csource\u201d or a \u201cmethod\u201d?If Yahoo News (not to be confused with the delicious cold chocolate drink Yoo-hoo) is a \u201csource\u201d for America\u2019s top intelligence services, then perhaps they should consider getting better sources.Or was Yahoo News a \u201cmethod\u201d? Meaning, America\u2019s intel geniuses knowingly used \u201cnews\u201d from Yahoo News that was leaked from a bogus partisan dossier written by the Kremlin and paid for by the Democrats?If that\u2019s the case they need better methods, too.The real \u201csources and methods\u201d exposed by the Republican memo, I fear, is the most obvious one: the FISA court itself.The real reason American intelligence officials worked so feverishly to conceal the GOP memo is that it exposes a dangerous disregard for American liberties and constitutional rights when it comes to spooks applying for search warrants on American citizens, raising serious questions about the entire FISA process.If the spies seeking these warrants are not more forthcoming and honest and the judges granting these warrants are not more demanding and suspicious, then the whole process should be completely overhauled.In the meantime, all of it should be exposed to sunlight. And that includes declassifying and releasing all the search warrants relating to this whole snake-bit Russia \u201ccollusion\u201d investigation.\u2022 Charles Hurt can be reached at [email\u00a0protected] and on Twitter @charleshurt.\n                 LOAD COMMENTS ()\n              HIDE COMMENTS", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Rowan Scarborough", "body": "Through targeted subpoenas and threatening letters, Rep. Devin Nunes has forced into the open a fuller story of how the Obama administration investigated suspected Russian ties to the Trump campaign and monitored people connected to the presidential candidate.The White House now has in its hands Mr. Nunes\u2019 latest revelation: his top-secret, four-page memo outlining supposed abuses in the Justice Department during months of Trump surveillance.Whether it was how the FBI used a Democrat-financed dossier or why the special counsel fired his top FBI agent or how many Trump associates were \u201cunmasked\u201d in wiretap spying, Mr. Nunes has unearthed facts that otherwise likely would have remained hidden.Democrats, led by Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, have pounced on Mr. Nunes for veering from the Trump-Russia collusion narrative to one of, they say, protecting President Trump.Mr. Schiff has relied heavily on the unverified Russia-sourced dossier to frame the investigation and interrogate witnesses. He has resisted all of Mr. Nunes\u2019 efforts to find out who paid for the dossier, who read it during the campaign or how the FBI relied on it to open its investigation.John Heilemann, a member of the mainstream media punditry, seemed to have reached the height of liberal frustration Tuesday when he suggested that Mr. Nunes was a Russian agent.\u201cIs it possible that we actually have a Russian agent running the House intel committee on the Republican side?\u201d Mr. Heilemann said on MSNBC. \u201cHe\u2019s behaving like someone who\u2019s been compromised, and there are people in the intelligence community and others with great expertise in this area who look at him and say, \u2018That guy\u2019s been compromised.\u2019\u201dMr. Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, won a Republican-majority vote Monday to release his memo, distilled from thousands of pages of secret documents. It details what he and other Republicans say were inappropriate actions by the FBI hierarchy and the Justice Department.The clock is ticking. The White House can opt to release the memo after a mandatory five-day review.To acquire access to the documents over a number of months, Mr. Nunes wrote letters accusing the Justice Department and the FBI of a cover-up, threatened to hold them in contempt and won as an ally House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican.Among Mr. Nunes\u2019 discoveries:The dossierOne of the most important, salacious and unverified documents in modern political history, the dossier begged the question, who paid its bills? Its 35 pages claim a wide criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence to hack Democratic Party computers. After more than a year, the FBI has not substantiated this.Mr. Nunes subpoenaed the bank records of investigative firm Fusion GPS, which paid dossier writer Christopher Steele, a former British spy. Fusion went to U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to block the move.The court battle flushed out D.C. law firm Perkins Coie LLP, which filed a letter disclosing it had financed Fusion\u2019s work with money from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.With that mystery solved, Republicans are trying to determine who used the dossier\u2019s scandalous information against Mr. Trump.Peter StrzokIn July, special counsel Robert Mueller fired Peter Strzok, a counterintelligence specialist and the top FBI agent in his Russia collusion investigation. Mr. Strzok was banished to the FBI\u2019s human resources branch.Mr. Nunes pressed the FBI for months to explain but received no response.On Dec. 1, retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to an FBI agent \u2014 Mr. Strzok \u2014 about whether he discussed sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The next day, the reason for Mr. Strzok\u2019s reassignment appeared in the press.Again urged on by Republicans, the Justice Department began releasing a series of text messages between Mr. Strzok and his lover, Lisa Page, chief legal counsel to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.The lovers talked of an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d against Mr. Trump and the activation of a \u201csecret society\u201d after his election victory. Ms. Page referred to Mr. Trump as a \u201cmenace.\u201dThe Justice Department inspector general obtained the messages from the pair\u2019s FBI cellphones. He has been investigating the FBI\u2019s handling of its probe into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s exclusive use of private email servers, rather than the state.gov domain, to conduct official business.The next step: Interview Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page to determine if they acted on their biases against Mr. Trump.Bruce and Nellie OhrMr. Nunes\u2019 inquiry dug up the fact that Mr. Ohr, a senior Justice Department official, met with Mr. Steele, the dossier writer, during the presidential campaign. At the same time, Mr. Ohr\u2019s wife, Nellie, a Russian scholar, worked for Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson. It is presumed she worked on the firm\u2019s opposition research to bring down candidate Trump.After the election, Mr. Ohr met with Mr. Simpson, though Mr. Ohr was not assigned to the Russia probe. Since the Fusion-Ohr disclosures, Fox News reported that he has been demoted for failing to disclose the meetings.UnmaskingMr. Nunes\u2019 investigative journey began in March with a trip to the White House to view classified documents. The documents pertained to unmasking, the process whereby senior government officials can request that a transcript of intercepted foreign communication be unredacted to reveal a U.S. person\u2019s name.Mr. Nunes discovered that National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice and U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power made hundreds of such requests, some of which pertained to Trump associates.Republicans say Mr. Nunes\u2019 investigation led directly to reforms in how officials can request identities of citizens unintentionally collected in foreign surveillance. The director of national intelligence now requires a higher level of approval before a name is revealed and disseminated.The news media criticized Mr. Nunes for visiting the White House. A liberal group filed a complaint with the House Ethics Committee, which conducted an investigation and cleared him.FBI conductThe next step is the release of the four-page memo produced by Mr. Nunes and his Republican colleagues.Republicans who read the document after signing nondisclosure agreements said it addresses the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and whether the dossier\u2019s information was used to obtain warrants.Rep. Trey Gowdy, South Carolina Republican and a member of the House intelligence committee, summed it up this way on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d: \u201cIf you think your viewers want to know whether or not the dossier was used in court proceedings, whether or not it was vetted before it was used, whether or not it\u2019s ever been vetted, if you are interested in who paid for the dossier, if you are interested in Christopher Steele\u2019s relationship with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee, then, yes, you will want the memo to come out.\u201dIt has been reported that Carter Page, a Trump campaign volunteer, was surveilled under FISA. The Steele dossier accuses Mr. Page of a series of collusion crimes, all of which he denies. He has filed a libel lawsuit against media outlets that reported the unconfirmed claims.In the 2000s, Mr. Page worked in Moscow as a Merrill Lynch banker. A New York energy investor, he visited Moscow in early July 2016 to deliver a public speech. He is generally pro-Russia and a critic of U.S.-imposed sanctions.Mr. Page provided a statement to The Washington Times: \u201cThe unfortunate attacks against Chairman Nunes represent the essence of the McCarthyism that has recently reemerged. For those who try accusing the Chairman of partisanship, at least his investigation\u2019s recent conclusions in the forthcoming memo allegedly focus on hard facts. In doing so, the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s findings should finally help America make a giant leap forward beyond the DNC-funded propaganda that has deceptively dominated the news for over a year already.\u201d\n                 LOAD COMMENTS ()\n              HIDE COMMENTS", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "S.a.

A more reasonable argument is that Mrs. Clinton wasn\u2019t macho enough to make it to the White House.At a Columbia University Women\u2019s Conference event on Sunday, Justice Ginsburg was asked again about the 2016 election, to which she opined, according to Fox News Insider, \u201d \u2018I think it was difficult for Hillary Clinton to get by even the macho atmosphere prevailing during that campaign, and she was criticized in a way I think no man would have been criticized,\u2019 Justice Ginsburg said. \u2018I think anyone who watched that campaign unfold would answer it the same way I did: Yes, sexism played a prominent part,\u2019 she continued.\u201dMrs. Clinton wasn\u2019t the only loser of the 2016 season. Does Justice Ginsburg think former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are all casualties of machismo? Perhaps their own lack of it. When voters looked at the world, we wisely decided against sending anyone who needed a safe space, face-planted into a van, or was low-energy, into the vipers\u2019 pit of the world.Political campaigns are about getting to know the candidates, but more than that, we find out in those environments who can handle the heat, and who can\u2019t. If Justice Ginsburg\u2019s wronged Hillary Clinton (or anyone else, for that matter) couldn\u2019t handle an unconventional, swaggering and confident American billionaire, how could she handle the world itself?Americans decided she couldn\u2019t. And not because of machismo, but because she doesn\u2019t have the fortitude to face all that the world throws at the American president. The fact that we can\u2019t ask the late U.S. Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ability to handle the tyrants and terrorists, tells you everything you need to know.It\u2019s leadership that empowers generals to do their job and wipe out the savages of ISIS. It\u2019s leadership that orders a roundup of the terrorist gang MS-13. It\u2019s leadership that forces Congress to do right by the American people with massive tax reform reinvigorating our economy and giving the future back to the American people. It\u2019s leadership that puts America first. If Justice Ginsburg wants to call all that machismo, fine. We\u2019ll take that over safe spaces any day.Mrs. Clinton and her little team of enablers are still wandering the forest clutching their pearls and gnashing their teeth over how the election was stolen from them.Mrs. Clinton, so completely unprepared for the White House, continues to reveal the actual reason for her massive failure: a complete lack of self-awareness brought on in part by a political system that for far too long had manipulated the environment guaranteeing certain outcomes.Mrs. Clinton and her two-time failed, little ragtag team can\u2019t accept the election results even now because they had already planned the rest of their lives. When they began their cruise to the White House, hitting an iceberg was the last thing they expected.An entire world of Democratic career bureaucrats, campaign workers and party operatives were all ready for the rest of their powerful and money-drenched lives. They expected at least eight more years of running the world, getting book deals, having who knows how many more billions of dollars pour in the Clinton Foundation. Then a cozy retirement on the taxpayers\u2019 dime for the rest of their lives rounded out the perfect plan.Until those deplorable Americans decided otherwise.After relying on Americans doing what they\u2019re told by your celebrity friends and colluding media, I suppose Mrs. Clinton can be forgiven for being confused, and that confusion still prevails. Newsweek reported she is planning on returning to the campaign trail to support candidates for the 2018 midterm elections. Yet, \u201c[d]espite plans to campaign for some Democrats, advisors and friends of Clinton said the former secretary of state wants to keep a low enough profile so as not to attract criticism from Republican candidates,\u201d according to the newsweekly.In other words, Mrs. Clinton will be hiding while she\u2019s helping. The woman who insists she could be president is still too unsure and too afraid to get out of the van. That\u2019s not machismo keeping her down, it\u2019s her own lack of character.Reflecting what most Democrats must now think, a Politico headline from this week blares, \u201cHillary Clinton Needs to Move On: Why is one of the most qualified leaders in the world continuing to let Trump define her, when she could be changing the subject?\u201dHere\u2019s a possibility: President Trump isn\u2019t defining Mrs. Clinton at all. Let\u2019s give the woman a little credit, shall we? Hillary Clinton is defining Hillary Clinton. The answer to Politico\u2019s question is simple, and not macho at all: Mrs. Clinton has failed and is failing now because she is not one of the most qualified leaders in the world.

Anything short of enforcing existing laws \u2014 anything short of that would be a slap in the face to not just our angel moms and dads, but every single American that voted for him,\u201d said Maria Espinoza, national director for the Remembrance Project.The project\u2019s angel moms and dads are parents whose children have been killed by illegal immigrants \u2014 in some cases people the same age as the Dreamers Mr. Trump is talking about granting full citizenship rights.They embraced Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign and appeared on stage with him at major immigration speeches and at the Republican nominating convention.\u201cHe knows very well by sitting in front of these families and holding their hands and speaking with them how our justice system mishandled cases and this violent illegal alien was released back into the community,\u201d Ms. Espinoza told The Washington Times.\u201cHe knows we want existing laws enforced,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have laws already on the books that are not being enforced.\u201dThe White House said Mr. Trump was making major concessions in envisioning citizenship for 1.8 million Dreamers. But officials said that was the price they figured they would have to pay to get the security and policy changes Mr. Trump wants, including an end to the Diversity Visa Lottery and limits to the chain of family migration.\u201cThis is the most centrist proposal on immigration that\u2019s ever been put forth in Washington,\u201d one senior White House official told reporters in laying out the details.Immigrant rights groups, though, blasted Mr. Trump and top policy adviser Stephen Miller, a major figure in the White House on immigration, for the plan.Lorella Praeli, director of immigration policy at the American Civil Liberties Union, called the White House blueprint \u201chateful\u201d and \u201cxenophobic.\u201d\u201cStephen Miller has said that his proposal is \u2018extremely generous,\u2019 but the only community that benefits from this supposed generosity are white supremacists,\u201d she said.Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez, Illinois Democrat, said Mr. Trump might as well spend the $25 billion he is asking for a border wall \u201cto erect a 50-foot concrete statue of a middle finger and point it toward Latin America.\u201d\u201cBoth a wall and the statue would be equally offensive and equally ineffective, and both would express Trump\u2019s deeply held suspicion of Latinos,\u201d he said.Frank Sharry, executive director of America\u2019s Voice, said the White House plan would cut legal immigration by 50 percent, as well as pursue changes that would make it tougher for illegal immigrants who dislike the poverty and violence in their home countries to claim asylum in the U.S.\u201cPresident Trump and Stephen Miller are exploiting a crisis that they created so they can take a wrecking ball to the Statue of Liberty,\u201d he said.Polling, though, suggests Mr. Trump may have found the sweet spot on immigration.

But there is another dynamic at work as well. Politics is also a long march with enduring themes \u2014 which is where books come in.Take, for example, \u201cUnderstanding Trump,\u201d by Newt Gingrich, due in four weeks from Center Street, the conservative imprint of Hachette Books. It features a foreword by the president\u2019s son Eric Trump \u2014 who describes the book as \u201can inside look into possibly the greatest campaign of all time.\u201dMr. Gingrich\u2019s work could provide a thoughtful rebuttal against claims that the president is unpresidential. Mr. Trump is, instead, different. Ironically, many inclusive-minded Democrats are not willing to tolerate this difference.\u201cIt is astonishing to me, as a historian, how the elite media and much of the political establishment refuse to try to understand Donald Trump. They have been so rabidly opposed to him, so ideologically committed to left-wing values, and so terrified of the future that they haven\u2019t stopped and considered how extraordinary his success has been,\u201d writes Mr. Gingrich. \u201cPresident Trump is one of the most remarkable individuals to ever occupy the White House. His set of practical business experiences \u2014 and his lack of traditional political-governmental experiences \u2014 make him a unique president.\u201dMr. Gingrich later advises, \u201cEven today, months after Trump won the election and was sworn in as president, the news media still tries to cover him as if he were a normal politician, and his ideological opponents continue to be viciously dishonest. They are either clueless or lying. Ignore them.\u201dMeanwhile, another book is on the way from Center Street, this titled \u201cLiars, Leakers and Liberals\u201d by Jeanine Pirro.\u201cAs an online commentator and host of her own show on Fox News for many years, Judge Jeanine Pirro has seen firsthand how narratives take form, whether they are based in truth or not,\u201d the publisher advises, noting that the book will identify the most \u201cegregious lies\u201d and the true toll of fake news, plus the falsehoods of modern-day feminists.The author will also explain \u201chow the media has twisted President Trump\u2019s words to fit the narrative they\u2019ve created,\u201d along with damage caused by anonymous sources and White House leaks, and the situation that Mr. Trump \u201cinherited\u201d from former President Barack Obama.Interesting to note that Ms. Pirro had lunch with Mr. Trump at the White House a few days ago, so her own sources are indeed current.FOR THE LEXICON\u201cOnline outrage mobs.\u201dThat\u2019s a handy term identified by Ari Cohn, an attorney and director of the individual rights defense program for Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, an interest group defending freedom of speech on college campuses.Mr. Cohn points out that \u201conline outrage mobs are all the rage recently, standing at the ready to inundate colleges and universities with demands to punish a student or professor the moment they say something that offends others.\u201d\u2018SPYING ON TRUMP\u2019\u201cAmericans overwhelmingly believe the Obama administration \u2018improperly surveilled\u2019 Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and a majority say they would like to see a special prosecutor appointed to look into possible misconduct by the FBI and Department of Justice in spying on Trump,\u201d says a new Investor\u2019s Business Daily editorial, which includes a poll revealing that 55 percent of the respondents said is was likely the Obama administration indeed improperly surveilled the Trump campaign while 54 percent approve of a special counsel to get to the bottom of the matter.\u201cThe poll\u2019s contents are troubling for those in the Democratic Party and the left-leaning media who had hoped to make a case with the American people that President Trump worked with Russian officials to win the 2016 election. The American people don\u2019t seem to believe it,\u201d the editorial suggests.NOTHING BUT CRICKETSSo is the Democratic rebuttal to the House Intelligence Committee memo just gathering dust?\u201cThe White House did not deny the release of the Democrats\u2019 memo. What they did is they said \u2018Look, you need to make some redactions and some technical corrections here, and we will get it out right away,\u201d Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House intelligence committee told Fox News Channel on Sunday.\u201cNow, from that point, we\u2019ve heard nothing but crickets. The Democrats have been on TV all weekend long. Their memo is sitting at the House Intelligence Committee down at the bottom of the Capitol waiting to be redacted. If they really wanted to get it out, they would have been down there all day redacting it, getting it back over to the White House so that the public can know what\u2019s in it.

Mr. Weissmann said in a court filing that Mr. Manafort has expressed doubts that he can \u201cmaintain the payments on all his mortgages.\u201d His Trump Tower condominium is at risk of foreclosure, he said.Mr. Manafort\u2019s attorney, Kevin M. Downing, filed his argument Feb. 16 in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to support his lawsuit against the Justice Department. He is asking District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson to end the special counsel\u2019s investigation of Mr. Manafort.Mr. Downing charges that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein violated the Justice Department\u2019s regulation for special counsels in May when he granted Mr. Mueller an open-ended mandate to investigate matters outside his appointed task: Russia election meddling and any Trump involvement.The pending money-laundering indictment in Washington against Mr. Manafort, President Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, goes back to transactions in 2005 that ended by 2014. The time span is many months before the Republican operative joined the campaign in March 2016.Mr. Downing said his lawsuit against the Justice Department \u201cwas filed shortly after and in direct response to the Special Counsel\u2019s threats to bring additional charges against Mr. Manafort in venues outside the District of Columbia. Those imminent threats cannot be denied.\u201dHis filing adds: \u201cThe government seeks to relegate Mr. Manafort to a game of criminal-procedure whack-a-mole that wastes judicial resources; that cannot offer complete (or even adequate) relief; and that leaves him powerless in any effort to match the government\u2019s resources.\u201dMr. Downing draws a comparison between the excesses of the old \u201cindependent counsel\u201d post with how Mr. Mueller is prosecuting Mr. Manafort.Congress ended the independent counsel law in 1999, and the Department of Justice wrote new regulations for special counsels.The knock on independent counsels was that they essentially set up a quasi-Justice Department with no oversight for an outside lawyer who was free to take years to conclude an investigation and go far afield of the original accusation.Mr. Downing\u2019s filing summed up the reasoning, returning to the issue of \u201cresources\u201d: \u201cA central problem with the independent counsel statute was that it provided essentially unlimited funding to conduct investigations that were essentially unlimited in scope. The Special Counsel Regulations, by contrast, are specifically designed to ensure political oversight over special counsels; to specify the scope of their original jurisdiction; to prevent expansion of that jurisdiction except where authorized by politically accountable officials; and to thereby avoid the overbearing pressures that result when prosecutors, with virtually unlimited resources, focus on a singular target with no competing priorities.\u201dMr. Downing said Mr. Rosenstein veered away from the special counsel regulation by allowing Mr. Mueller to investigate \u201cany matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\u201d\u201cThe Complaint alleges that the Acting Attorney General lacks authority to grant such jurisdiction under the Special Counsel Regulations,\u201d the Manafort filing states. \u201cBecause the DOJ and the Acting Attorney General had no authority to grant the Special Counsel such blanket additional jurisdiction in the original Appointment Order, the Special Counsel has no authority to exercise it.\u201dAn unending investigationMr. Rosenstein appointed Mr. Mueller after Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescued himself from any Trump-Russia investigations.Mr. Mueller\u2019s carte blanche, Mr. Downing said, \u201csubjects [Mr. Manafort] to the threat of investigation after investigation, seizure after seizure, in jurisdiction after jurisdiction, so long as the Special Counsel deems them to have \u2018arisen\u2019 out of the investigation.\u201dFor that matter, Mr. Downing said, it is impossible for the Manafort investigation to have arisen from the Russia-Trump probe.\u201cAlthough Mr. Manafort served as President Trump\u2019s campaign chairman for six months in 2016, he is now being investigated for previously known business conduct that long preceded, and had no connection to, the 2016 presidential election,\u201d he argued.Under Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s order, \u201cThe Special Counsel can continue to investigate and pursue new charges against Mr. Manafort in different districts for conduct that long predates the 2016 presidential election. The Special Counsel has made clear that he intends to do just that,\u201d the attorney said.Mr. Downing said there is no indication that Mr. Mueller is investigating Mr. Manafort in the Russia-Trump matter.The Justice Department is representing Mr. Rosenstein and argues that the district judge lacks authority to end a federal criminal investigation. It argues that Mr. Manafort\u2019s recourse is a motion to dismiss the indictment.Mr. Manafort heads an international political consulting firm and various companies. The grand jury indictment says he used those firms to illegally launder millions of dollars, provided by Ukrainian political clients, from Cyprus banks to domestic accounts.His attorney and Mueller prosecutors are now engaged in a courtroom skirmish over bail and the worth of Manafort properties put up as collateral. Mr. Manafort remains under surveillance and confined to his home in Alexandria, Virginia.The same day Mr. Downing filed his argument, Mr. Weissmann filed a paper accusing Mr. Manafort of bank fraud.Mr. Weissmann charges that a Fairfax, Virginia, property that the defendant plans to cite as bail was acquired through fraudulent applications to the Federal Savings Bank. He said Mr. Manafort provided the bank with \u201cdoctored profit and loss statements\u201d for his consulting firm.The Weissmann motion says Mr. Manafort is withdrawing properties in New York and Florida as collateral and now cites three other ones that \u201care deficient in various respects.\u201dMr. Weissmann said the changes mean the defendant is proposing assets worth far less than the $10 million bail set by the judge.One property in Arlington was purchased for his daughter with \u201ctainted funds from a Cypriot account,\u201d the motion said.What\u2019s more, Mr. Manafort said the Fairfax property holds no mortgage when in fact it does, Mr. Weissmann said.And Mr. Manafort\u2019s Trump Tower condo is at a \u201crisk of bank foreclosure.\u201d\u201cThe fact that Manafort has not been able to find any responsible surety to cosign a bond for this package suggests that neither those closest to him, nor anyone else, is willing to assume the risk of being a surety [guarantee] for him,\u201d Mr. Weissmann said.The Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

Michael Behenna seeks a shot at redemption. It may be a long shot.\nBehenna\u2019s cause was launched by his attorney on Jan. 17, but the former Ranger\u2019s bid has picked up a lot of high-ranking support. At various times, Behenna has had the support of dozens of generals and admirals across the four branches of armed forces. This month, Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter wrote President Trump requesting a pardon for a native son of his state.\n\u201cI do not believe Lt. Behenna should carry the burden of a miscarriage of justice the rest of his life,\u201d Mr. Hunter said.\nAs far as the military is concerned, there has been no miscarriage. In 2008, while serving in the Sunni Triangle, an improvised explosive device killed two soldiers in Behenna\u2019s command: Spc. Adam Kohlhaas, 20, of Kentucky, and Spc. Steven Christofferson, 20, of Wisconsin. An Iraqi translator and two other Iraqi soldiers allied with U.S. forces also perished.\nEnraged and distraught, the Rangers began combing the enemy infested villages north of Baghdad. Intelligence pointed them to Ali Mansur, a local identified as an al Qaeda operative who was found with weapons and a Syrian passport when soldiers arrested him, according to court briefs. After several days of interrogation, however, military intelligence could not crack the suspect and Behenna was ordered to return Mansur to his home.\nThat was an inexplicable and significant blunder, said John Richter, a King  Spalding partner handling Behenna\u2019s pardon request. It was a mistake to order an officer still reeling from the loss of valuable soldiers under his command to release the suspect he believed guilty.\n\u201cIt was an awful management decision to send Lt. Behenna to return the guy,\u201d Mr. Richter said.\nThe decision went badly awry. In a move even those who support him acknowledge was a ghastly dereliction of duty, Behenna stopped Mansur\u2019s return convoy and took the suspect into a railroad culvert off the main road. There he ordered Mansur to strip and, with an interpreter, began a final interrogation.\nThose facts are not in dispute. What happened next, on the other hand, is: When he turned his attention to the translator, Behenna claims, Mansur leaped to his feet and threw a lump of concrete at his captors in an attempt to escape. In what he called self-defense and Army prosecutors an execution, Behenna shot Mansur twice.\nBehenna was charged with premeditated murder in a combat zone, but that harsh crime wasn\u2019t proved. In his trial at Fort Campbell, a jury found him guilty of the lesser crime of unpremeditated murder in a combat zone. Behenna received a 25-year sentence in the Leavenworth prison.\nIt was a crushing blow and ignoble end to what had been an impeccable and promising military career.\nGrowing up outside of Oklahoma City, Behenna seemed destined to a life of public service. His father was with the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation and was shot in the line of duty when his son was 4. Behenna\u2019s mother was an assistant U.S. attorney who was on the prosecution team that convicted Timothy McVeigh in the Oklahoma City bombing.\nBut something else came out of Behenna\u2019s trial, Mr. Richter said: a prosecutorial error. On the eve of trial, a top forensic investigator hired by the Army concluded that the evidence supported Behenna\u2019s version of events.\nWithout notifying the defense, Army prosecutors quietly scrubbed the investigator from their witness list. When Behenna took the stand in his own defense, his story lacked any buttressing testimony. That was precisely what the investigator would have offered, he told dumbfounded defense attorneys after the trial.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, known as the CAAF, acknowledged that Behenna\u2019s team should have been told that one of the Army\u2019s star witnesses thought the defendant was telling the truth. Yet the error did not influence the trial to the extent that he deserved another one, the appeals judges said in its 3-2 split decision. The appeals court did reduce Behenna\u2019s sentence to 15 years.\nThe court concluded that Behenna forfeited a self-defense claim as he pointed his sidearm at a suspect outside of \u201can active battlefield situation.\u201d That was where 37 flag and general officers, including a former member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, took issue with the court. They said self-defense had to be available to service members in dangerous and unstable situations around the world.\nInstead, the court had \u201ctreated an American soldier\u2019s confrontation with a suspected al-Qaeda operative in a combat zone as no different in principle than a soldier\u2019s stateside barroom brawl,\u201d the generals and admirals wrote. \u201cThat makes no sense because the everyday risks to servicemembers in far-flung combat zones around the world are different in kind from the risks inherent in stateside altercations.\u201d\nThe high-ranking officers argued that Behenna\u2019s conviction would in fact put U.S. service members in peril.\n\u201cUnder the CAAF\u2019s categorical rule, servicemembers who point their weapons without authorization at suspected enemies in a combat zone lose their right to self-defense, and hence must flee if attacked. In this case, if Mansur had overpowered Lieutenant Behenna and seized his weapon, not only Lieutenant Behenna\u2019s life but also the lives of nearby soldiers under his command could have been lost,\u201d the officers wrote. \u201cIf Lieutenant Behenna\u2019s testimony is truthful \u2014 as the decision of the CAAF assumes and this Court must assume \u2014 then Lieutenant Behenna would have been derelict of duty not to use his weapon to defend himself.\u201d\nThe Supreme Court declined to hear Behenna\u2019s case, but the self-defense precedent is germane to the request for pardon, both Mr. Richter and Mr. Hunter say.\nAlthough he believes the Brady violations at Behenna\u2019s trial were significant, Mr. Richter stressed that his goal is not to relitigate the case. Behenna, who through Mr. Richter declined to be interviewed, isn\u2019t trying to do that, either.\nThe reason for the pardon is to lift the cloud on Behenna. A presidential pardon would \u201cnot change the nature of a discharge or expunge a record of conviction,\u201d according to military regulations.\n\u201cHe seeks forgiveness; the pardon is ultimately a form of forgiveness,\u201d Mr. Richter said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t commit any crime; this is not an exoneration.\u201d\nBy all accounts, Behenna has handled his burden well. After his first parole hearing in March 2014, he walked out of Fort Leavenworth, where he was a model prisoner who read voraciously and learned Spanish. Now, he is building a familiar and comfortable Sooner life: working on a 4,000-acre ranch in Medford and regularly visiting his folks in Edmond.\nMr. Richter said it\u2019s absurd to think there is any risk to the public or of recidivism as Behenna completes his probation, yet he has to register as a violent offender and is forbidden from many lines of work because of his status as a felon.\nMr. Hunter said he has encountered nothing but enthusiastic support from fellow Okies for Behenna\u2019s cause. If there are opposing groups, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard of them,\u201d Mr. Hunter said. Local press has also followed Behenna\u2019s saga, often with a largely sympathetic tone.\nIndeed, The Oklahoman, the state\u2019s largest newspaper, said in a January 2014 editorial that it was \u201cconvinced politics played a role in his sentence\u201d and urged Behenna be paroled.\nThe Washington Times sought reaction to the pardon request from several international human rights groups, which all declined to comment on the case.\nThe Pentagon and the Justice Department declined requests for comment. Mr. Richter said the military has acknowledged receipt of the pardon request, though it remains unclear if any formal review has been initiated.\nThe normal process in this case would be for the Pentagon to send its recommendation to the Justice Department, whose decision would be sent to the White House for presidential review. The president has unilateral authority to issue a pardon at any time, however.\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\nMr. Trump has issued one pardon so far, to former Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona. The president didn\u2019t even wait for Mr. Arpaio\u2019s criminal contempt of court conviction to be finalized before offering clemency to his prominent political ally.\nThe president also has commuted a sentence for the former owner of a kosher slaughterhouse in Iowa who had been convicted of financial crimes.\nBehenna\u2019s request presents a different type of case, and history is hardly replete with military pardons.\nWhile it is not unheard of for a president to exercise his executive power under Article II, Clause 1 of the Constitution on a convicted service member\u2019s behalf, it is rare and most cases involved more high-profile incidents than Behenna\u2018s.\nAfter the Civil War, President Johnson extended a pardon to all former Confederates on Christmas Day 1868. Lt. William Calley, found guilty on 22 counts of premeditated murder for his role in the My Lai massacre in Vietnam, was pardoned by President Nixon.\nThe Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

The Italian-American has spent nearly her whole life in politics, first as a 20-year member of the Democratic National Committee from California, then as the state party\u2019s chairman.She first won election to the House in 1987 \u2014 when Ronald Reagan was president \u2014 and she\u2019s been there ever since. In 2002, after working her way to the top, Mrs. Pelosi was elected speaker of the House, the first woman ever to helm a national party in the august chamber.It cannot be denied that Mrs. Pelosi has devoted her life to public service, and that (at least) is a noble cause.Now, the bad news. She\u2019s done \u2014 she\u2019s past done. Her ever-growing list of verbal blunders is far too long to catalog here, and the 77-year-old seems more and more out of touch with regular Americans (dubbing the recent tax cuts by President Trump \u2014 which amounts to thousands of dollars for many people \u2014 \u201ccrumbs\u201d is just the latest example).Worse, Mrs. Pelosi seems to keep coming up with new ways to embarrass herself.Like this week, for example. Mrs. Pelosi, like most Democrats, is freaked out by the House vote on Monday to release a four-page GOP memo alleging that the FBI and Justice Department illegally spied on the Trump campaign in 2016.That same day, she got into a heated argument with Chris Cuomo, an anchor at Dem-friendly CNN. When asked about the damning memo, she called the document a \u201ctotal misrepresentation\u201d and said it should be reviewed by intelligence officials before it is made public.At one point, Mr. Cuomo asked Mrs. Pelosi why FBI Director Christopher A. Wray has not objected to the release of the document if it\u2019s so awful. Mrs. Pelosi lost it. \u201cLet me just say this with all due respect: You really don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about right now,\u201d she spat at Mr. Cuomo, then proceeded to stammer and stutter through a list of weak reasons why the memo should not be released.That\u2019s been the strategy of top Democrats throughout: Argue that the memo, produced by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican, and his staff, is highly partisan and cannot be understood if viewed without the massive supporting documentation.Rep. Adam Schiff, California Democrat, last week said Congress cannot release the memo because the American public won\u2019t be able to understand it. \u201cWell, because the American people, unfortunately, don\u2019t have the underlying materials and therefore they can\u2019t see how distorted and misleading this document is,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cThe Republicans are not saying \u2018Make the underlying materials available to the public.\u2019 \u201cBut the memo likely will go public soon. In an effort to distract, Mrs. Pelosi said on CNN that its contents are all part of a \u201ccover-up.\u201d\u201cI think [House Speaker Paul D. Ryan] has a major responsibility and what I call a cover-up of what they are doing, it\u2019s really very sad,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi said in the CNN interview. \u201cBut again, it\u2019s a cover-up, it\u2019s a distraction. What really we are trying to do right now is keep government open. They have a problem with that because they are ineffective.\u201dAnd as she politicized the GOP effort to get to the bottom of the matter, she said, \u201cThis is not to be politicized.  It\u2019s not about making up a false memo.\u201dRepublicans, meanwhile, say the American people can make up their own minds. They argue that the memo details clear evidence of an anti-Trump bias both at the Justice Department and within special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into Russia\u2019s supposed interference in the 2016 election.Were the memo not so bad for Democrats \u2014 perhaps even good news \u2014 Mrs. Pelosi would no doubt be pushing for transparency and openness in government. Instead, she\u2019s insisting Americans are too dumb to understand the memo \u2014 which is all a lie and a cover-up, anyway.We\u2019d say that takes the cake, but Pelosi\u2019s bound to open her mouth again very soon, and who knows what embarrassing thing she\u2019s going to utter next.As Mrs. Pelosi said: \u201cIt\u2019s really very sad.\u201d\u2022 Joseph Curl has covered politics for 25 years, including 12 years as White House correspondent at The Washington Times.

None is identified.Funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party, these specific dossier charges of secret spy missions and criminality are what came to permeate the FBI investigation. Republicans say the FBI abused the court process by using the partisan charges to obtain four wiretap warrants against the other campaign. They say the bureau has yet to confirm any charge.As the dossier today takes on even more importance, The Washington Times identified Mr. Steele\u2019s 10 core collusion accusations. The analysis includes the charges\u2019 status, 20 months after Mr. Steele first contacted the FBI and urged the prosecution of President Trump.\u2981 The Trump campaign launched an \u201cextensive conspiracy\u201d with the Kremlin to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. To date, no public verification.\u2981 Mr. Trump, for decades a developer of tall buildings, maintained an eight-year relationship of give-and-take with Russian intelligence. To date, no public verification.\u2981 Mr. Trump and senior campaign aides actively supported the Russia hacking of Democratic Party computers to steal and release stolen emails. To date, no public verification.\u2981 Volunteer Carter Page and campaign manager Paul Manafort personally conspired with Moscow to hack the Democrats\u2019 computers. When the hacking began in 2015, neither man was associated with the Trump campaign. Both deny the charge. Mr. Page testified under oath that he had never met or spoken with Mr. Manafort. To date, no public verification of this dossier part.\u2981 Mr. Page, an Annapolis graduate, an energy investor and a former resident of Moscow, traveled to that city in early July 2016 to deliver a public speech at a university. The dossier says he met with two top Kremlin operatives and discussed bribes for working to lift economic sanctions. Mr. Page testified under oath that he had never met nor spoke with them. He has filed libel lawsuits.\u2981 Mr. Trump engaged with Russian prostitutes during a trip to Moscow in 2013. Mr. Trump has denied this numerous times. To date, no public verification.\u2981 Mr. Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, secretly traveled to Prague in August 2016. His supposed mission: to orchestrate payments with agents of Vladimir Putin to cover up the hacking. At that point, the hacking was known worldwide. Mr. Cohen repeatedly has denied under oath that he took such a trip and showed his passport. He has filed libel lawsuits, including against Fusion GPS. Fusion co-founder Glenn Simpson, who ordered the dossier, has suggested that Mr. Cohen took a private Russian plane and might have been on a yacht in the Adriatic Sea. To date, there has been no public verification of any of this.\u2981 Russian tech entrepreneur Aleksej Gubarev, owner of XBT Holding, hacked the Democrat Party computers with spyware and pornography. He has denied this repeatedly. He sued Mr. Steele for libel in a London court, where the former spy said the information was raw call-in information and not verified.\u2981 Three Russian oligarchs and shareholders in Alfa Bank were involved in Russian election interference and paid bribes to Mr. Putin. They deny the charges and have filed libel lawsuits.\u2981 Mikhail Kalugin was chief of the economic section at the Russian Embassy in Washington. Mr. Steele accuses him of being a spy and of funding the hacking with skimmed-off pension funds. He was supposedly whisked out of Washington when the hacking scandal broke in August. Washington associates of Mr. Kalugin told The Washington Times that the diplomat announced his planned departure 10 months beforehand. He and his family returned to Moscow. He now works in the Foreign Ministry. A former senior U.S. government official told The Times that Mr. Kalugin was never internally identified as a spy.Republicans and dossier targets uniformly deride the 35 pages as falsehoods and fabrications. Some Democrats have acknowledged that the collection of memos is flawed.But there are steadfast dossier believers, such liberal Twitter brigades and Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the leading Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.The FBI used the unverified dossier on Oct. 21, 2016, to obtain a court wiretap warrant on Mr. Page that lasted nearly a year.Agents included dossier information in the application and three subsequent renewals. The filing was based on the pledge from Mr. Steele that he was not the source of a dossier-type report on Mr. Page that Michael Isikoff reported in Yahoo News in September 2016. But in the London court case, Mr. Steele acknowledged that he was the source.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, released a declassified referral last week that urges the Justice Department to open a criminal investigation of Mr. Steele for lying to the FBI.Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, issued a rebuttal on Friday.\u201cNot a single revelation in the Steele dossier has been refuted,\u201d she said, referring to the former MI-6 officer as a \u201crespected and reliable expert on Russia.\u201dShe said the Grassley-Graham referral \u201cprovides no evidence that Steele was ever asked about the Isikoff article or if asked that he lied.\u201dBut the Republican senator\u2019s referral said there is ample evidence that Mr. Steele lied.\u201cThere is substantial evidence suggesting that Mr. Steele materially misled the FBI about a key aspect of his dossier efforts, one which bears on his credibility,\u201d the referral said.The next paragraph, which presumedly details that evidence, is completely redacted.The two senators wrote, \u201cThe FBI already believed Mr. Steele was reliable, he had previously told the FBI he had not shared the information with the press \u2014 and lying to the FBI is a crime.\u201dFour targets of the dossier have filed seven libel lawsuits against Mr. Steele, Fusion GPS and BuzzFeed, which first posted it online on Jan. 10, 2017, during Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential transition.Then FBI-Director James B.

Chris Coons, Delaware Democrat, in sponsoring the Senate companion to a bipartisan proposal in the House worked out between Reps.

I like turnover. I like chaos. It really is good.\u201d\nReferring to reports that Chief of Staff John F.

In the other job, I was the host of a smash television hit. Television\u2019s so easy compared to this.\u201d\nThe president spared almost no Democrats in his speech.\nOn Rep.

But lawmakers got into bitter disputes over policy decisions, such as whether to ban money from going to Planned Parenthood, whether to keep sending grant money to sanctuary cities, how much to pay for Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall and what to do about illegal immigrant \u201cDreamers.\u201d\nMr. Frelinghuysen and other House and Senate appropriators crafted the package, but the big ideological battles were settled by Mr. Ryan, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican.\nMany conservative Republicans said the bill fell short on Mr. Trump\u2019s promises, ceding ground on issues like abortion, guns, and immigration as well as accepting a massive boost in deficits.\n\u201cThis is wrong. This is not the limited government conservatism our voters demand. Our constituents \u2014 our employers \u2014 deserve better,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows, North Carolina Republican and chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.\nThe bill allocates $1.6 billion for border security measures that the president wanted, but both sides disputed exactly how much would be dedicated to building the wall itself.\nDemocrats complained that the bill didn\u2019t offer new protections to Dreamers who benefit from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\u201cIt is indefensible for Congress to pass a spending bill that not only leaves Dreamers without permanent protections but also funds their deportations and those of immigrants with deep ties to their communities,\u201d the Congressional Hispanic Caucus said in urging its members to vote \u201cno.\u201d\nWith the midterm election season already under way, the \u201comnibus\u201d spending bill could be one of the the last major pieces of legislation Congress clears this year, and lawmakers raced to attach other legislative priorities as well.\nThe bill includes a gun-related measure incentivizing states and federal agencies to submit more of their records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which flags people like felons and domestic abusers who are banned from buying guns.\nThe legislation also retains a longstanding ban on federal health agencies using money to advocate or promote gun control, but clarifies that they can still conduct research into the causes of gun violence \u2014 another minor win for gun control advocates who argue the ban has still had a chilling effect on research.\nSen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who chairs a state/foreign operations spending subcommittee, also secured language he had been pushing for several years that ends federal money for the Palestinian Authority until it clearly demonstrates it has stopped funding terrorist activities.\nThe Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

Comey lied to them and had a plan to double-cross President Trump.\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina sent a letter last week to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. They and two other Republicans want a special counsel with the powers of the Trump-Russia probe\u2019s Robert Mueller to investigate suspected Justice Department corruption.\nThey attached a second letter to Michael E. Horowitz, the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, outlining all the avenues that need to be navigated \u2014 complete with new and expanded accusations. They want an investigation to look at whether Mr. Comey set up Mr. Trump as president-elect.\nMr. Comey visited Mr. Trump for an intelligence briefing at Trump Tower days before he took office. Mr. Comey broke the news about what he called a \u201csalacious and unverified\u201d dossier now known to have been bought by the Democratic Party from its contractor, former British spy Christopher Steele. It told of Mr. Trump supposedly frolicking with prostitutes in Moscow and overseeing Russia\u2019s hacking of Democratic Party computers.\nAt the moment Mr. Comey called the scintillating dossier \u201cunverified,\u201d the FBI was using it to justify a wiretap on former Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page.\nThe briefing instantly leaked to CNN, rocking the transition team with a series of unverified dossier accusations. BuzzFeed then posted the 35-page dossier, which remains unconfirmed publicly.\n\u201cThere is a question as to whether the FBI included the dossier in the briefing, and possibly leaked that it had done so, in order to provide the media a pretext to report on the dossier,\u201d Mr. Grassley and Mr. Graham wrote.\nDemocrats, such as Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, seized on the dossier as authentic and used it to pummel the Trump White House for more than a year.\nThe Grassley-Graham letter also asserts that information provided to the Judiciary Committee by Mr. Comey in a private interview is directly contradicted by the FBI\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications to spy on Mr. Page.\n\u201cDid Director Comey intentionally mislead the committee?\u201d the senators say in the letter.\nThe senators also asked the inspector general to get to the bottom of one key question in the nearly yearlong wiretap warrant.\nThe FBI asked a FISA judge to approve the surveillance, mostly on the word of Mr. Steele\u2019s dossier. The FBI did not disclose to the judge that the dossier was Democratic Party opposition research paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign. The Republicans want Mr. Horowitz to find out why there was no disclosure.\n\u201cDid anyone express any concerns about the propriety of presenting unverified, uncorroborated claims from the Steele dossier as the basis for a FISA warrant on an American citizen?\u201d the letter stated.\nThe letter also asked for an investigation into Mr. Steele\u2019s ties to the Russian government and its intelligence services. The dossier\u2019s claims, all of which have been denied by Trump people, were sourced by Mr. Steele to unknown Kremlin operatives. Mr. Steele was once posted at the British Embassy in Moscow while an MI6 spy.\nSince the Oct. 21, 2016, FISA warrant allowed the FBI to seize emails and digital messages before the start of the Trump campaign, the senators asked if Obama administration political appointees read those documents.\nAfter the FBI fired Mr. Steele for breaking a pledge not to go to the press, the investigative firm Fusion GPS, his paymaster, set up a back channel to the bureau team investigating the Trump campaign, according to the letter. The flow of information went from Mr. Steele to Fusion GPS to Associate Attorney General Bruce Ohr to FBI investigators.\nAt the time, Mr. Ohr\u2019s wife, Nellie, worked at Fusion and was investigating Mr. Trump. Mr. Ohr, whose office was steps away from the Obama Justice Department hierarchy, was subsequently demoted.\n\u201cWas anyone in the Justice Department, including senior leadership, aware that Mr. Ohr continued to pass information from Steele and Fusion GPS to the FBI even after Steele was suspended, and terminated, as a source?\u201d the letter said.\nMr. Grassley and Mr. Graham already have urged the Justice Department to investigate whether Mr. Steele told a fundamental lie to the FBI that skewed how the bureau filled out its Carter Page wiretap proposals.\nAt first, their Steele referral to the Justice Department in January was highly classified and redacted. But that changed.\nRep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, pressed the FBI to turn over FISA material. He then wrote a memo exposing what he considered the abuses and got it cleared by the White House.\nMr. Schiff, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, then wrote a rebuttal, which mostly was cleared by the White House, resulting in more information being declassified.\nOn the Senate side, that resulted in the lifting of more redactions from the Steele referral.\nA key disclosure appeared for the first time in the Grassley-Graham referral, and it came from Mr. Schiff\u2019s rebuttal of a few weeks earlier.\nThe issue is this: Before a judge, the FBI used a Yahoo News story to bolster Mr. Steele\u2019s claim that Mr. Page, while on a trip to Moscow, visited two high-ranking Kremlin figures and discussed bribes for sanctions. Mr. Page repeatedly has denied this under oath.\nThe FBI asserted to the judge that Mr. Steele wasn\u2019t the source, even though the Yahoo story continued the exact same information. The public now knows Mr. Steele made that pledge to the FBI.\nIn a previously redacted sentence taken directly form the FBI\u2019s FISA application, the bureau wrote, \u201c[Mr. Steele] told the FBI that he/she only provided this information to the business associate [Fusion GPS] and the FBI.\u201d\nIf the FBI is quoting Mr. Steele correctly, then he lied, the senators say.\nThe following spring, Mr. Steele admitted in a court filing in London that he did in fact speak to Yahoo in September in Washington at the urging of Fusion. It is on that basis that Mr. Nunes says Mr. Steele lied, and that Mr. Grassley and Mr. Graham are seeking an investigation.\nSaid the referral: \u201cThe FBI repeatedly represented to the court that Mr. Steele told the FBI he did not have unauthorized contacts with the press about the dossier prior to October 2016. The FISA applications make these claims specifically in the context of the September 2016 Yahoo News article. But Mr. Steele has admitted \u2014 publicly before a court of law \u2014 that he did have such contacts with the press at this time, and his former business partner [Fusion founder Glenn] Simpson has confirmed it to the Committee.\u201d\nMr. Comey has defended himself via his Twitter account against corruption charges from Mr. Trump. His memoir is due out April 17, and he has scheduled a busy round of media interviews.\n\u201cMr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon.

Homan, the agency\u2019s deputy director.\u201cFewer jail arrests mean more arrests on the street, and that also requires more resources, which is why we are forced to send additional resources to those areas to meet operational needs and officer safety,\u201d Mr. Homan said. \u201cConsistent with our public safety mission, 88 percent of those arrested during this operation were convicted criminals.\u201dThe actions and notices came even as Congress was debating \u2014 and failing to pass \u2014 legislation that would have legalized about a sixth of the illegal immigrant population in the U.S.ICE said some of those nabbed will be prosecuted for illegal entry or re-entry after a previous deportation, while others whose cases aren\u2019t prosecuted will face deportation.Perhaps more striking that the arrests, however, is the renewed focus on business that employ illegal immigrants.The 122 notices come on top of 77 notices served on businesses in northern California earlier this year.ICE said California\u2019s sanctuary city status notwithstanding, businesses are still required to follow federal law, which demands they conduct verification checks before hiring employees.Democrats in Congress had objected to ICE\u2019s attempts to enforce immigration laws at businesses.In a Jan. 31 letter, 17 of the chamber\u2019s more liberal lawmakers said they were \u201ctroubled\u201d by the justifications ICE had cited for the previous round of business enforcement.\u201cICE officers have a mission to promote homeland security and public safety, not to act as an arm of the government designed to intimidate and harass business owners, their employees or their patrons, and certainly not to use raids as a threat of \u2018what\u2019s to come,\u2019\u201d said the Democrats, led by Rep.

They also recount different conversations he had with Comey, who kept notes on meetings with Trump that unnerved him.\nThough the precise contents are unknown, the memos possibly could help substantiate McCabe\u2019s assertion that he was unfairly maligned by a White House he says had declared \u201cwar\u201d on the FBI and Mueller\u2019s investigation. They almost certainly contain, as Comey\u2019s memos did, previously undisclosed details about encounters between the Trump administration and FBI that could be of interest to Mueller.\nThe disclosure Saturday came hours after Trump called McCabe\u2019s firing by Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u201ca great day for Democracy\u201d and asserted without elaboration that McCabe knew \u201call about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels off the FBI!\u201d In the last year, Trump has repeatedly condemned McCabe as emblematic of an FBI that he insists is biased against his administration.\nThat sent former CIA Director John Brennan, an outspoken Trump critic, into a Twitter tizzy: \u201cWhen the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history. You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America\u2026America will triumph over you.\u201d\nSessions said he acted on the recommendation of FBI disciplinary officials who said McCabe had not been candid with a watchdog office investigation. McCabe was fired two days before his retirement date on Sunday. The dismissal likely jeopardizes his ability to collect his full pension benefits and, more broadly, could add to the turmoil that has enveloped the FBI since Comey\u2019s firing and as the bureau moves ahead with an investigation the White House has dismissed as a hoax.\nAn upcoming inspector general\u2019s report is expected to conclude that McCabe, who spent more than 20 years with the FBI, had authorized the release of information to the media and was not forthcoming with the watchdog office as it examined the bureau\u2019s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. McCabe has vigorously disputed the allegations and said his credibility had been attacked as \u201cpart of a larger effort not just to slander me personally\u201d but also the FBI and law enforcement.\n\u201cIt is part of this administration\u2019s ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the special counsel investigation, which continue to this day,\u201d he added. \u201cTheir persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the special counsel\u2019s work.\u201d\nThe firing set off dueling tweets between Trump, who called the termination a \u201cgreat day for the hard working men and women of the FBI,\u201d and Comey, the director he fired 10 months ago.\nTrump called Comey \u201csanctimonious\u201d and said Comey made McCabe \u201clook like a choirboy.\u201d Comey, referencing his highly anticipated book that comes out next month, responded with his own tweet: \u201cMr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon. And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.\u201d\nAlso Saturday, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, John Dowd, cited the \u201cbrilliant and courageous example\u201d by Sessions and the FBI\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility and said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should \u201cbring an end\u201d to the Russia investigation \u201cmanufactured\u201d by Comey.\nDowd told the AP that he neither was calling on Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller\u2019s inquiry, to fire the special counsel immediately nor had discussed with Rosenstein the idea of dismissing Mueller or ending the probe.\nMueller is investigating whether Trump\u2019s actions, including Comey\u2019s ouster, constitute obstruction of justice. McCabe could be an important witness, and his memos could be used by investigators as they look into whether Trump sought to thwart the FBI probe. Comey\u2019s own memos, including one in which he says Trump encouraged him to end an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, have been provided to Mueller and are part of his investigation.\nMcCabe, in a statement defending himself, asserted he was singled out by the administration because of the \u201crole I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath\u201d of Comey\u2019s firing last May.\nHe became acting director after that but clashed with the Trump administration, including when he publicly rejected White House assertions that Comey had lost the support of the rank-and-file. He abruptly left the deputy director position in January and went on leave.\nThe firing arises from an inspector general review into how the FBI handled the Clinton email investigation. That inquiry focused not only on specific decisions made by FBI leadership but also on news media leaks.\nMcCabe came under scrutiny over an October 2016 news report that revealed differing approaches within the FBI and Justice Department over how aggressively the Clinton Foundation should be investigated. The watchdog office has concluded that McCabe authorized FBI officials to speak to a Wall Street Journal reporter for that story and that McCabe had not been forthcoming with investigators. McCabe denies it.\nMcCabe became entangled in presidential politics in 2016 after it was revealed that his wife, during her unsuccessful run for state Senate in Virginia one year earlier, received campaign contributions from the political action committee of then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe, D-Va., a longtime Clinton friend. The FBI has said McCabe received the necessary ethics approval about his wife\u2019s candidacy and was not supervising the Clinton investigation at the time of the contributions.\n\u2022 Associated Press writer Chad Day contributed to this report.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.  \n\nThe Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

In July, Sessions announced that cities and states could only receive Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance grants if they allow federal immigration officials access to detention facilities and provide advance notice when someone in the country illegally is about to be released.\nCities and states were also required to certify that they complied with a particular federal immigration law.

It\u2019s complicated and sometimes counterintuitive, though. At the moment, \u201cFire and Fury\u201d ranks No. 49 on Amazon.\nBut back to Mr. Comey.\nThe former FBI director\u2019s book \u2014 presumably written after he was dismissed from his post by President Trump 10 months ago \u2014 has been cited as a must-read by Time, USA Today, Entertainment Weekly and Publisher\u2019s Weekly, among several news organizations.

Look at MSNBC or Fox News, and you will see those continually either denigrating Trump or praising him. I think the answer is in the middle, and in this class I talk about how it\u2019s important to get your personal politics out. It\u2019s destructive to become too politicized.

Devin Nunes of California, for peeling back the curtain on the secretive U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and its sensitive processes.They say the memo amounts to a misleading \u201chit job\u201d designed to sow doubt about probes into the Trump campaign\u2019s alleged interactions with Russian actors.And they say it doesn\u2019t reflect all of the material that went into the government snooping application.That drew a rebuke from Mr. Gowdy.\u201cI wish that they were equally concerned about what\u2019s not in the FISA application, which is a lot of really important information about the source, and its sub-sources, and the fact that he was hired by the DNC and the Clinton campaign, and the fact that he was biased against President Trump,\u201d said Mr. Gowdy, who last week said he will return to the legal field instead of seeking re-election.\u201cI would argue it\u2019s also somewhat unprecedented to rely on political opposition research to instruct and inform an application, and it\u2019s really bad precedent and unprecedented to not tell a court that a source has this level of bias,\u201d he said.Mr. Gowdy said he hopes the revealing memo is a \u201cone-off,\u201d but he also thinks it\u2019s important to detail how the FBI sought its snooping powers, since the judge \u201cdoesn\u2019t do independent research.\u201dHe is among top Republicans preaching caution, even as vocal conservatives say heads should roll at the FBI and Justice Department.Mr. Gowdy said the probe into the Trump campaign by special counsel Robert Mueller goes far beyond the controversial memo.\u201cThere is a Russia investigation without a dossier,\u201d he said, rattling off a list of things outside of its scope, such as a mysterious meeting between a Russian lawyer and Trump officials at Trump Tower.The GOP memo itself says the FBI dug into the Trump campaign after another one of its aides, George Papadopoulos, reportedly boasted in mid-2016 that Russia had dirt on Mrs. Clinton.Democrats have warned Mr. Trump not to use the memo to go after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversaw renewals of the surveillance application and appointed Mr. Mueller, saying it would cross a red line \u2014 particularly in light of Mr. Trump\u2019s firing last year of FBI Director James B. Comey.As Mr. Gowdy himself noted, the GOP memo \u201cdoesn\u2019t have anything to do with obstruction of justice.\u201d\n                 LOAD COMMENTS ()\n              HIDE COMMENTS", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "By", "body": "ST. LOUIS \u2014 A condemned Missouri inmate faces a potentially \u201cgruesome and painful\u201d execution because of a rare medical condition that compromises the man\u2019s veins and causes multiple tumors in his head and throat, his attorney said Sunday.\nRussell Bucklew is scheduled to die by injection Tuesday evening for killing a former girlfriend\u2019s new boyfriend in 1996 in eastern Missouri.\nBucklew, 49, was moments away from execution in May 2014 when the U.S. Supreme Court halted it amid concerns about Bucklew\u2019s medical condition. He suffers from cavernous hemangioma, a rare ailment that causes weakened and malformed blood vessels, as well as blood-filled tumors in his nose and throat.\nNearly four years later, the condition has worsened, attorney Cheryl Pilate said.\n\u201cMr. Bucklew\u2019s rare and severe condition creates a very substantial risk of a gruesome execution, with choking and gagging on blood and the infliction of excruciating pain,\u201d Pilate said.\nA panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has already refused to stop the execution. An appeal and stay request are pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. Pilate also has asked for clemency from Republican Gov. Eric Greitens.\nEmail messages seeking comment Sunday from spokespeople for Greitens and Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley were not immediately returned.\nThe appeal offered a chilling possibility of what Bucklew\u2019s supporters believe could happen during the execution.\n\u201cThose highly sensitive tumors easily rupture and bleed,\u201d the appeal said. \u201cAs he struggles to breathe through the execution procedure, Bucklew\u2019s throat tumor will likely rupture,\u201d causing him to choke on his own blood.\n\u201cBucklew\u2019s execution will very likely be gruesome and painful far beyond the pain inherent in the process of an ordinary lethal injection execution,\u201d the court document said, adding it would violate Bucklew\u2019s constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment.\nIn his response to the U.S. Supreme Court, Hawley downplayed Bucklew\u2019s medical condition and cited continuing efforts over several years to put off the execution.\nBucklew\u2019s appeals also have suggested that if the execution is carried out, the state should use lethal gas instead of an injection of pentobarbital. Missouri law still lists gas as an option, but the state no longer has a gas chamber and has not used the method since 1965.\nNone of the 20 inmates executed since Missouri began using pentobarbital in 2013 have shown obvious signs of pain or suffering.\nAccording to court documents, Bucklew was angry at his girlfriend for leaving him and moving in with Michael Sanders of Cape Girardeau when he tracked her down at Sanders\u2019 home in March 1996. He killed Sanders in front of the woman, her two daughters and Sanders\u2019 two sons and then attacked the woman and drove her to a secluded area and raped her.\nAfter a state trooper spotted Bucklew\u2019s car, Bucklew shot at the trooper but missed, court records say. Bucklew later escaped from jail, hid in the home of the ex-girlfriend\u2019s mother and beat her with a hammer.\nThe execution would be the first in Missouri since January 2017.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.  \n\nThe Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

Lott Jr., the report\u2019s author and president of the research center.His findings also challenge the general narrative that immigrants commit fewer crimes. Those past studies usually don\u2019t look at legal versus illegal populations, Mr. Lott said.Mr. Lott said the Arizona data is able to peek behind that curtain, and the differences between the populations were stark.\u201cThere appears to be a huge difference between the two groups,\u201d Mr. Lott said. \u201cThe type of person who goes through the process to legally immigrate in the United States appears to be very law-abiding versus even the U.S.-born population. The reverse is true for undocumented immigrants \u2014 they are committing crimes, and more serious crimes.\u201dAmong nearly 4,000 first- and second-degree murder convictions, undocumented immigrants accounted for nearly 13 percent \u2014 significantly higher than their percentage of the population. Legal immigrants, by contrast, were less than 1 percent of convicts. Native-born made up the rest.Undocumented immigrants also accounted for five times the rate of convictions for money laundering and kidnapping, and were three times more likely to be convicted of drive-by shootings.The data covered from 1985 to 2017. For his data purposes, Mr. Lott defined undocumented immigrants as those who weren\u2019t U.S. citizens or green card holders, signaling permanent residency.He said the crime rates of the undocumented who were ages 18 to 35 was particularly important, given the ongoing debate over legalizing illegal immigrant \u201cDreamers.\u201d He said the Arizona data showed that population had crime rates 250 percent higher than their share of the population would have predicted.The Washington Times had asked several experts to look at Mr. Lott\u2019s research paper but some didn\u2019t respond, while one said he was unable to get Mr. Lott\u2019s data and had questions about Mr. Lott\u2019s methodology.Mr. Lott said told The Times that the data belonged to Arizona and his agreement was that he wouldn\u2019t give out the raw data without their approval.Mr. Sessions\u2019 citation of the data Friday inserted the information directly into the ongoing immigration debate.\u201cThey\u2019re more likely to be convicted of sexual assault, robbery, and driving under the influence.  They\u2019re more than twice as likely to be convicted of murder,\u201d Mr. Sessions said in remarks prepared for a speech in Norfolk, Virginia.He continued: \u201cTens of thousands of crimes have been committed in this country that would never have happened if our immigration laws were enforced and respected like they ought to be.\u201d\n                 LOAD COMMENTS ()\n              HIDE COMMENTS", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Stephen Dinan", "body": "Former Attorney General Eric H.

You can only be president for a month. And according to America\u2019s political scientists, you\u2019re still a better president than Donald Trump.To mark Presidents\u2019 Day, the American Political Science Association released Monday its quadrennial assessment of the \u201cgreatness\u201d of America\u2019s 44 presidents.In the survey, taken by 170 members of the APSA\u2019s presidential specialists, Mr. Trump was judged the worst president in American history despite having only been in office for a year and not having overseen any wars, depressions or other administration-defining catastrophes.The two men immediately above him \u2014 James Buchanan in 43rd and William Henry Harrison in 42nd \u2014  have conventionally been called America\u2019s worst presidents for decades.Buchanan was president as the nation itself fell apart in the late-1850s over the issue of slavery. Harrison died of pneumonia only 31 days after delivering a two-hour inaugural dress without a coat or hat in a cold, wet day in a pre-antibiotics era (1841).\u201cTrump\u2019s initial rating places him in an ignominious category, but dozens of presidents have had slow starts and have course corrected to improve their public esteem,\u201d wrote Brandon Rottinghaus and Justin Vaughn, both political science professors, in an article at the New York Times outlining the survey.\u201cBeyond his reputation or ranking, Donald Trump\u2019s very presidency may alter perceptions of presidential legacies as his unique approach to the office continues to surprise,\u201d they concluded.For decades, conservatives have seen the American academy as having a liberal and leftist bias.Not only did Mr. Trump place dead last, but his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, leaped into the top 10, coming in 8th ahead of such conservative icons as Ronald Reagan and John Adams and liberal champions such as Lyndon Johnson, John Kennedy and Woodrow Wilson.According to Mr. Rottinghaus and Mr. Vaughn, the two presidents who suffered the sharpest declines since the last survey was taken in 2014 were \u201cBill Clinton, arguably the result of contemporary scorn for his treatment of women, and Andrew Jackson, for evolving attitudes on his treatment of Native Americans.\u201dMr. Clinton dropped from 8th to 13th and Jackson from 9th to 15th.The top seven presidents were the same ones, in the same order, as in 2014 \u2014 Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Franklin Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt, Thomas Jefferson, Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower.On a brighter spot for Republicans, Ronald Reagan broke into the top 10 for the first time, moving from 11th in 2014 to 9th this year.The Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

In addition, 17 people were wounded.\nBut more than a year earlier, documents in the criminal case against Nikolas Cruz and obtained by The Associated Press show school officials and a sheriff\u2019s deputy recommended in September 2016 that Cruz be involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation.\nThe documents, which are part of Cruz\u2019s criminal case in the shooting, show that he had written the word \u201ckill\u201d in a notebook, told a classmate that he wanted to buy a gun and use it, and had cut his arm supposedly in anger because he had broken up with a girlfriend. He also told another student he had drunk gasoline and was throwing up. Calls had even been made to the FBI about the possibility of Cruz using a gun at school.\nThe documents were provided by a psychological assessment service initiated by Cruz\u2019s mother called Henderson Behavioral Health. The documents show a high school resource officer who was also a sheriff\u2019s deputy and two school counselors recommended in September 2016 that Cruz be committed for mental evaluation under Florida\u2019s Baker Act.

Forrest, an Obama appointee to the bench, said the government was following the law when it picked up Ravidath Lawrence Ragbir, the illegal immigrant. But she said there were \u201clarger, more fundamental\u201d rights at stake that were trampled on.\u201cIn sum, the court finds that when this country allowed petitioner to become a part of our community fabric, allowed him to build a life with and among us and to enjoy the liberties and freedom that come with that, it committed itself to allowance of an orderly departure when the time came,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBy denying petitioner these rights, the government has acted wrongly.\u201dShe becomes the latest federal district judge to delve deeply into immigration \u2014 an area Congress has said belongs to the separate immigration court system and to appellate judges, not district judges.Other cases are raging over deportations of Iraqis and Indonesians, with federal judges taking unprecedented steps to stop deportations and rule on individual cases.The Justice Department declined to comment on Monday\u2019s decision.PHOTOS: NFL cheerleaders who became famousJudge Forrest said her ruling doesn\u2019t mean Mr. Ragbir is safe from deportation.He has been ordered removed by an immigration court, and that stands.Immigrant-rights groups said they\u2019re still hoping to fight that, though for now they praised Judge Forrest\u2019s ruling.\u201cRavi and other immigrant rights leaders have been viciously targeted by ICE for speaking out against the injustices of our immigration system. This is a naked attempt to intimidate us into silence, but we will only get louder,\u201d said Steven Choi, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition.Mr. Ragbir was a legal immigrant who earned status in 1994, but who was convicted of loan fraud. After completing his sentence he was turned over to deportation officers for removal.He was in Homeland Security\u2019s custody for nearly two years before being released in 2008 on what\u2019s known as an order of supervision, meaning he was still in loose federal custody.He has been fighting for legal status in the years since, and had been regularly checking in with deportation officials as required by his supervision order.He was told he could be deported at any time once travel documents were obtained, but was told the deportation would be \u201corderly.\u201dIn the meantime, he\u2019s become an immigrant-rights activist, working on a Homeland Security-issued work permit.Earlier this month, Homeland Security ended its yearslong delay of deportation and detained Mr. Ragbir, saying it was going to enforce his deportation.Judge Forrest said immigration has become such a mess, with so many competing agendas, that it\u2019s now \u201ca corn maze\u201d to be navigated.She said the government had correctly read the maze. But she said ruled the outcome unconstitutional.\u201cIt ought not to be \u2014 and it has never before been \u2014 that those who lived without incident in this country for years are subjected to treatment we associate with regimes we revile as unjust, regimes where those who have long lived in a country may be taken without notice from streets, home and work.

Adam B. Schiff of California, Democrats on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence publicly kicked off the investigation on March 20, 2017, by reading a number of unverified Steele charges into the record. No line of inquiry was off limits, including Mr. Steele\u2019s story about President Trump and prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room in 2013.\nMr. Steele wrote of an \u201cextensive conspiracy\u201d between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Mr. Trump has called the former British spy\u2019s dossier a collection of fiction. In an April court filing, Mr. Steele backed off his strongest claims and talked only of \u201cpossible coordination.\u201d\nSince March 20, as testimony about suspected collusion went into the recesses of the U.S. Capitol\u2019s sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF, pronounced skiff), Democrats began a pattern of leaking to favored media, sometimes as a witness was still testifying.\nAfter a recent leak, Rep. Lee M. Zeldin, New York Republican, tweeted: \u201cHoly cow. The leaks coming from Dems on HouseIntelComm are out of control! Witnesses come in for hours of testimony at a time  then Dems instantly leak their version of 1 question  that\u2019s that. Do rules, confidentiality  process matter at all anymore?\u201d\nMr. Trump and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders have bluntly accused Mr. Schiff of spoon-feeding the press confidential anti-Trump material. Mr. Trump told The Wall Street Journal in January that when Mr. Schiff leaves a committee interview, a news report on the testimony quickly follows.\nMr. Schiff denies he is leaking.\n\u201cThey owe me an apology, but frankly it would be a wasted errand to ask for one,\u201d Mr. Schiff said on CNN. \u201cAnd if Sarah Huckabee Sanders is going to have to give out apologies to everyone that he has criticized unfairly, she would be doing nothing else all day.\u201d\nAfter Mr. Trump called him a \u201ctotal phony,\u201d and \u201cleakin\u2019 monster,\u201d Mr. Schiff tweeted back: \u201cWait a minute, Mr. President. Am I a phony or sleazy, a monster or little? Surely you know the key to a good playground nickname is consistency. I thought you were supposed to be good at this.\u201d\nA review of committee press coverage shows that more than two dozen leaks appear to be Democrat-generated. At least five were inaccurate, two decidedly wrong.\nRepublicans appear to have leaked a smattering of testimony stories favorable to Mr. Trump. Democrats have accused Republicans of leaking private text messages between Sen. Mark R. Warner, Virginia Democrat, and Adam Waldman, a Washington lawyer attempting to negotiate a meeting with Mr. Steele.\nFive Democrat leaks that Republicans say missed the mark:\n\u2022 CNN reported that emails from presidential son Donald Trump Jr., who was testifying that day, show he received a tipoff from WikiLeaks days before the anti-secrecy group dispensed more stolen Democratic Party emails. The story stayed active a full day before CNN corrected it to say the tipoff came after the public release.\nMr. Trump Jr.\u2019s attorney strongly implied that Democrats purposely injected an inaccurate leak into the Trump-Russia debate.\n\u2022 CNN and other news sites reported erroneous Democratic versions of data on Russian-bought Facebook advertising. Democrats leaked in October to CNN that the ads targeted Michigan, Wisconsin and other swing states. The message was clear: Russians made the difference in handing Mr. Trump two pivotal states to win 270 electoral votes.\nBut the Washington Examiner looked at numbers and messages and concluded that the ads designed to stir unrest were written awkwardly. Sen. Richard Burr, North Carolina Republican and chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued numbers that showed deep-blue Maryland received more Facebook ads than Wisconsin, with 262 and 55 respectively. No Wisconsin ad mentioned Mr. Trump.\n\u2022 The Daily Beast reported that Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, refused to deny a charge from Democrats that he collaborated with the White House on his blockbuster memo. It detailed abuses by the FBI in obtaining a wiretap on Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page.\nThe committee later released a transcript of the business meeting that showed Mr. Nunes had vigorously denied that he worked with White House. The conservative news website The Federalist wrote: \u201cOnce again, reporters got burned by believing anonymous Democrats [on the House committee].\u201d\n\u2022 The New York Times ballyhooed a leak that said White House communications director Hope Hicks admitted to telling \u201cwhite lies\u201d during nine hours of testimony. Her admission was in answer to a Democrat\u2019s question about whether she had ever been untruthful, even to the point of telling white lies. She said sometimes, such as in telling a caller that Mr. Trump was not in when he was.\n\u2022 Democrats leaked that Ms. Hicks said two of her email accounts \u2014 one personal, the other a campaign address \u2014 had been hacked. Only one personal account, going back to Ms. Hicks\u2019 college days, had been hacked. Republicans said Ms. Hick\u2019s testimony was so inconsequential that Democrats were forced to leak petty asides.\nRepublicans note other piecemeal leaks designed to sully Mr. Trump. Democrats leaked that his personal assistant, Keith Schiller, testified that while Mr. Trump was in Moscow in 2013 for his Miss Universe contest that a Russian offered prostitutes. Mr. Schiller laughed it off. Democrats leaked this small excerpt to spin to reporters that there is credence to the Steele dossier\u2019s section about prostitutes.\nDemocrats also routinely leak the schedules for upcoming witnesses. Their motive, Republicans say, is to make sure the media capture footage of the witnesses as they walk in and out of the panel\u2019s secure hearing room.\nDossier, front and center\nCommittee Democrats early on set the tone for their inquisition.\nWhile the Senate intelligence committee avoids most partisan squabbles, House Democrats went after Mr. Trump from the start. Their weapon: the unverified dossier complied by Mr. Steele, who was paid by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.\nMr. Schiff wholeheartedly endorsed the information and its author, Mr. Steele. He was joined by the panel\u2019s most liberal wing: Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, Rep. Jackie Speier of California, Joaquin Castro of Texas and Andre Carson of Indiana.\nA year later, the dossier\u2019s core charges remain unconfirmed by the FBI. After scouring millions of pages of documents and interviewing scores of witnesses, Mr. Nunes has said there was no Russia-Trump collusion.\nThe final word will come from special counsel Robert Mueller, who continues to call Trump people to testify and wants to interview the president.\nAt the March 20 hearing, Mr. Steele was the witness in absentia as Democrats read his charges and tried to coax agreement from then-FBI Director James B. Comey and Navy Adm. Mike Rogers, director of the National Security Agency.\nSaid Mr. Carson: \u201cIn fact, the dossier written by former MI6 agent Christopher Steele alleges that Trump agreed to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue, which is effectively a priority for [Russian President] Vladimir Putin. There\u2019s a lot in the dossier that is yet to be proven, but increasingly as we\u2019ll hear throughout the day, allegations are checking out. And this one seems to be as accurate as they come.\u201d\nWhen Adm. Rogers said it is possible the Kremlin would trade favors for intelligence from foreigners, Mr. Castro concluded, \u201cOK. Well, the dossier definitely seems right on these points. A quid pro quo relationship seems to exist between the Trump campaign and Putin\u2019s Russia.\u201d\nMr. Schiff embraced Mr. Steele\u2019s narration of a trip to Moscow in July 2016 by Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page. Mr. Steele\u2019s sources said Mr. Page met with two Kremlin figures who offered bribes for sanctions relief.\nMr. Page has denied under oath to Congress that he met the two men or discussed bribes.\nMr. Steele said Mr. Page was offered a brokerage fee of Russian oil giant Rosneft\u2019s planned sale of a 19 percent stake to private investors.\nMr. Schiff credited Mr. Steele with predicting the 19 percent figure in an October memo in a sale that happened two months later: \u201cIs it a coincidence that the Russian gas company, Rosneft, sold a 19 percent share after former British intelligence officer Steele was told by Russian sources that Carter Page was offered fees on a deal of just that size?\u201d\nBut a check of the internet shows that Moscow announced the 19 percent figure the previous July. The 19 percent was public knowledge when Mr. Steele wrote his memo.\nMonths after the March 20 hearing, Democrats continued to pursue the Steele stories as they questioned witnesses, according to three testimony transcripts released at the request of the witness.\nThere is the far-fetched tale that Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal attorney, secretly traveled to Prague in August 2016 to meet with Putin aides and devise a cover-up for the hacking of Democratic Party computers.\nMr. Cohen has testified under oath that he never went to Prague or engaged in any cover-up of Russian hacking.\nBut Mr. Schiff and others have persisted. Glenn Simpson, a co-founder of Fusion GPS, who paid Mr. Steele, suggested in testimony that Mr. Cohen could have traveled to Prague on a yacht and a Russian plane.\nAfter testimony, Democrats have sometimes accused Trump witnesses of lying, without specifics.\nMs. Speier accused former Trump campaign adviser Michael Caputo of lying after his testimony but gave no details.

Mr. Soros loves the establishment and the deep state because he is one of them. He was a co-chair of the Ready for Hillary PAC\u2019s finance panel and is a longtime comrade of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Mr. Soros funded resistance against Mr. Trump before the election (Remember the Trump rally in Chicago that had to be canceled due to violent protests in the streets?), and he continues to do so across the country.Mr. Soros\u2018 money has been traced to the #Resist movement, including funding to #disrupt the presidential inauguration. (Perhaps Americans should consider anew the definitions of sedition and treason?)But with every Soros-sponsored, ranting feminist march and radical protest designed to incite racial divides, attentive Americans are beginning to realize that the leftists are so intent on gaining power that they are even willing to tear our nation apart and pit neighbor against neighbor.Mr. Soros also spends millions of dollars to advance his open borders and illegal migration in order to achieve a \u201cpermanent progressive majority.\u201d Of course, this means promoting amnesty, giving noncitizens the right to vote and doing away with voter verification.Mr. Soros knows that hardworking, freedom-loving Americans want to protect our country and individual freedom. His goal is to bring in as many people from the outside as possible and make them dependent on our government so they will always be willing to cast their votes for liberal and leftist politicians who care more about power than they do about helping people become independent.For confusing optics and sound bites, Mr. Soros even \u201crents\u201d leftist \u201cministers,\u201d like Sojourners founder Jim Wallis.

Winer, who was former secretary state John Kerry\u2019s special envoy to Libya and his Senate adviser, disclosed the the behind-the-scenes get-Trump operation in a Washington Post op-ed on Friday.Mr. Winer confirmed a redacted Senate report released on Tuesday that said information on candidate Trump flowed between Mr. Steele and Clinton operatives, with Mr. Winer as the middleman.Mr. Steele, a former British spy, wrote the anti-Trump dossier with money provided by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, through Fusion GPS.The Hillary Clinton agents are Sidney Blumenthal, a well-known fierce Clinton defender and freelance intelligence gatherer, and his collaborator, Cody Shearer.Mr. Winer\u2019s disclosures mean that, not only was the Hillary Clinton campaign paying Mr. Steele, but her loyalists were also providing raw intelligence that got incorporated into the Steele dossier and went to the FBI.Mr. Winer said he shared the dossier charges in a two-page summary with career diplomat Victoria Nuland who said she planned to share it with Mr. Kerry.The Senate document, prepared by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, Iowa Republican, said two reports came from State (apparently Mr. Winer) to Mr. Steele from Blumenthal-Shearer. Their source was a \u201cforeign-sub-source.\u201dMr. Steele paid intermediaries to collect his unverified attacks from Kremlin sources on Mr. Trump and associates.Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, has announce he will next investigate the dossier roles of the State Department and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s operatives.To date, his investigation into FBI and Department of Justice abuses has turned up a series of new disclosures.He found out who financed the discredited dossier. It alleges a still-unconfirmed \u201cextensive conspiracy\u201d between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin to interfere in the 2016 election.Mr. Nunes also discovered that the FBI used the partisan dossier to convince a judge to issue a wiretap warrant on Trump volunteer Carter Page. He disclosed that the FBI cited a Yahoo News story as corroboration when in fact it too came from the dossier.He further found that the FBI planned to pay Mr. Steele to continue investigating the candidate who came to be President Trump. The FBI suspended the relationship after Mr. Steele went to the press with his allegations days before the Nov. 8 election.The Senate report is Mr. Grassley\u2019s criminal referral asking the Justice Department to investigate Mr. Steele for lying to the FBI. The referral said Mr. Steele  assured the FBI he did not talk to Yahoo News when in fact he did.Mr. Grassley\u2019s referral confirms Mr. Nunes\u2019 findings and contains new dossier information. Mr. Steele wrote an Oct. 19 memo based on the Winer-Blumenthal-Shearer connection. It was not part of the 35-page dossier posted on Jan 10, 2017 by BuzzFeed.The FBI heavily redacted the memo so there are few details. But the three names appeared in an earlier Grassley letter to the DNC asking for any communications between them.Mr. Winer\u2019s op-ed said that Mr. Shearer came up with some of the same salacious allegations as did Mr. Steele.Mr. Winer said he had accepted Mr. Steele\u2019s previous foreign policy reports and has been an \u201cold friend\u201d of Mr. Blumenthal for decades.\u201cBlumenthal and I discussed Steele\u2019s reports,\u201d Mr. Winer wrote. \u201cHe showed me notes gathered by a journalist I did not know, Cody Shearer, that alleged the Russians had compromising information on Trump of a sexual and financial nature. What struck me was how some of the material echoed Steele\u2019s but appeared to involve different sources.\u201dMr. Steele had contacted Mr. Winer in what the Senate report, quoting an associate, described as his \u201cdesperate\u201d effort to defeat Mr. Trump.Mr. Winer wrote, \u201cOn my own, I shared a copy of these notes with Steele, to ask for his professional reaction. He told me it was potentially \u2018collateral\u2019 information. I asked him what that meant. He said that it was similar but separate from the information he had gathered from his sources. I agreed to let him keep a copy of the Shearer notes.\u201dMr. Steele\u2019s dossier includes the un-substantiated charge that Mr. Trump entertained prostitutes in a Moscow hotel in 2013.

Of that, just $2.3 billion was clawed back, leaving $3.5 billion in outstanding excess payments.\u201cThe overpayments were that much?\u201d said Rep. Phil Roe, Tennessee Republican.He said he is trying to expand an assistance program for older veterans and their caregivers. \u201cI can think of a lot of things I can use $3.5 billion dollars for,\u201d he said.Most Obamacare exchange customers receive taxpayer-funded subsidies to help cover their premiums.The amount they receive is based on their expected earnings. At the end of the year, they are supposed to reconcile what they anticipated with what they actually earned. Because some received higher incomes \u2014 through raises, promotions or better jobs \u2014 they have to repay the IRS.But authors of the 2010 law were afraid that the threat of a big tax bill would discourage people from buying Obamacare coverage altogether, so they set limits on the amount of money the government could claw back.Those limits have been tweaked over the years because Congress feared it was giving away unearned money.The $3.5 billion figure told lawmakers that they are still leaving a lot of money on the table. The 2017 figure is more than five times the number from 2015, which was the first tax year after Obamacare was fully operational.Assuming similar overages for the rest of the decade, the $35 billion would be more than enough to pay for President Trump\u2019s border wall trust fund, with money left over to cover an anti-opioid effort.\u201cThat begins to get to be a lot of money,\u201d said Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, Oregon Republican.Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director, said he is not sure why the amounts spiked in the latest reported year, though it might be because of income growth. In other words, people underestimated their income before their earnings rose in a good economic climate, so they received more taxpayer assistance than they should have.Others explained the big numbers by pointing to subsidy payments that have been rising with soaring premiums on the economically shaky exchanges or by suggesting that some consumers figured out how to game the system.\u201cThere may be some strategic behavior involved, with some people intentionally underestimating their income with the expectation that they will not have to pay back excess credits beyond the cap,\u201d said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University. \u201cBut estimating income for people with seasonal or hourly pay jobs is very difficult, and expecting people to revise their income estimates every month, with corresponding revisions in their premium payments, is not realistic.\u201dFor that reason, Obamacare defenders warn against being too harsh on customers. They say it doesn\u2019t make sense to repeal the caps and demand full repayment of excessive subsidies.\u201cThere are tips people get that are hard to predict, there\u2019s holiday pay \u2014 there are many reasons people might have done their best but gotten an overpayment,\u201d said Cheryl Fish-Parcham, director of access initiatives for Families USA, a consumer group that advocates for affordable health care.Under Obamacare, the subsidy money goes straight to insurers, though the customers are responsible for returning overpayments. Once they hit the repayment cap, however, the extra money amounts to a taxpayer-funded benefit they don\u2019t deserve.Republicans say allowing people to keep benefits to which they aren\u2019t entitled adds to their case against Obamacare.\u201cThat\u2019s just yet one more absurdity in the Affordable Care Act. It makes no sense,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy, Louisiana Republican.He said education, public safety, infrastructure and defense could use the money instead. \u201cMaybe \u2014 God forbid, don\u2019t faint dead away \u2014 we could actually give some of it back to the taxpayers,\u201d he said.The House passed an Obamacare replacement that would have recaptured all of the excess subsidy during a multiyear transition period from the current program to a Republican system. But the Senate discarded the bill, and the repeal push faltered amid Democratic opposition and defections from three Republicans.A White House official said Wednesday that the inability to claw back excess subsidy is outrageous and should be remedied, though analysts say any attempt to scrap the cap would likely run into a Democratic filibuster in the Senate.Senate Finance Committee spokeswoman Julia Lawless said Chairman Orrin G. Hatch, Utah Republican, \u201chas consistently supported congressional efforts to claw back Obamacare\u2019s overpayments.\u201d\u201cWhile past efforts have been blocked by Senate Democrats, the chairman is continuing to talk to members on how this can be best addressed,\u201d she said.It\u2019s unclear if the forfeited dollars exceed what Congress should have expected or what future years might hold. A spokeswoman for the Congressional Budget Office, which evaluates the likely fiscal impact of legislation, said it hasn\u2019t studied the issue.As it stands, subsidized customers must pay back no more than $1,275 \u2014 $2,500 for families \u2014 although repayments among low and midrange earners are capped at $300 and $750 ($600 and $1,500 for families), respectively.The law was originally far more generous, capping the amount the government could claw back at $250 for individuals and $400 for families.But Congress has twice passed bills raising the caps, freeing up more money to spend on other bipartisan initiatives: First in 2010, as part of the annual \u201cdoc fix\u201d to stave off cuts to Medicare reimbursements for doctors, and then again in 2011 to pay for repeal of Obamacare\u2019s unpopular 1099 provision, which would have required businesses to fill out a tax form every time they paid a vendor $600 or more.Mr. Jost said the amount forfeited through Obamacare is still a \u201cdrop in the bucket\u201d compared with the hundreds of billions of dollars that fall into the \u201ctax gap\u201d created by individuals and business that underpay taxes overall.\u201cIf Congress is serious about making sure people pay their taxes,\u201d he said, \u201cit would dramatically increase funding for IRS audits for people who are currently cheating on their taxes and getting away with it \u2014 and they are not primarily poor people.\u201d\n                 LOAD COMMENTS ()\n              HIDE COMMENTS", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Stephen Dinan", "body": "President Trump will propose a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrant \u201cDreamers,\u201d nearly tripling the Obama-era DACA program, the White House said Thursday as it previewed the plan the president will submit to Congress next week.Mr. Trump\u2019s vision is less than the 3 million people granted legal status under the plan pushed by Sens.

Those already in the backlog would be allowed to enter, but no future applications would be accepted from extended family.Combining the legalization and the security puts Mr. Trump squarely in the middle of the immigration debate, between Democrats who want the most generous amnesty and House Republicans who opposed citizenship and were instead pushing a massive package of security changes.\u201cAs part of this effort to ensure there is full bipartisan support for this package, we believe the total number that will be able to apply for legal status \u2026 will be a population of individuals of 1.8 million people,\u201d a senior White House official said.The official said there couldn\u2019t be a deal on Dreamers without the border security, enforcement and policy changes.\u201cThis is kind of a bottom line for the president,\u201d another official told reporters at the White House.The plan calls for a $25 billion trust fund to be created to build Mr. Trump\u2019s wall and other infrastructure. That would ensure the money can\u2019t be withheld by a future Congress.Mr. Obama had supported a path to citizenship for Dreamers, but was unable to get that legislation through Congress, which is why his administration went around Capitol Hill to create the DACA program.Begun in 2012, it approved some 800,000 people for renewable two-year permits granting them a stay of deportation and authority to work in the U.S. Of those people, some 690,000 were still protected under DACA as of late last year.The additional 1.1 million people Mr. Trump would enroll about 600,000 people who were eligible for DACA but, for various reasons, didn\u2019t apply, and another 500,000 or so who would be admitted under adjusted timelines.The White House called the 1.8 million \u201ca dramatic concession by the White House to get to 60 votes in the Senate.\u201dIt would take between 10 and 12 years to earn citizenship.Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, said the president had embraced an \u201camnesty\u201d that even President Obama didn\u2019t get.\u201cI do not believe we should be granting a path to citizenship to anybody here illegally,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of these proposals being floated that have a path to citizenship for DACA recipients are markedly to the left of where President Obama was. DACA itself has no path to citizenship under President Obama\u2019s illegal executive amnesty.\u201dDemocrats, meanwhile, remained skeptical of Mr. Trump\u2019s support for citizenship, which he announced to reporters on Wednesday.\u201cWhat he says on Tuesday is not to necessarily what he says on Thursday,\u201d said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.Still, Sen. Michael Bennet, Colorado Democrat, said the president\u2019s move toward citizenship for Dreamers was \u201cencouraging.\u201d\u201cI think there is a general consensus among people working on this that a pathway has to be part of it,\u201d he said.The White House\u2019s new plan could undercut efforts by House conservatives, who back a much tougher security plan. That would grant the 690,000 people now under DACA a new legal status of three-year work permits, approved by Congress, in exchange for mandatory use of E-Verify for businesses to check their employees\u2019 work status; curtailing abuse of the asylum system; cracking down on sanctuary cities; and punishing repeat-illegal immigrants.The White House said it envisioned Mr. Trump\u2019s plan as the basis for Senate negotiations, but said they anticipate the House operating on a separate path.\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to force something on the House at this point, I think the House has got its own independent process,\u201d an adviser said.\n                 LOAD COMMENTS ()\n              HIDE COMMENTS", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Dave Boyer", "body": "The White House confirmed Tuesday night that President Trump has asked the Pentagon to arrange a grand military parade in Washington to showcase the pride and valor of U.S. armed forces, possibly on Independence Day.\u201cPresident Trump is incredibly supportive of America\u2019s great service members who risk their lives every day to keep our country safe,\u201d said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. \u201cHe has asked the Department of Defense to explore a celebration at which all Americans can show their appreciation.\u201dThe idea of soldiers and tanks rolling down the avenues of the nation\u2019s capital came to Mr. Trump during a visit to Paris last year, when French President Emmanuel Macron treated his guest to a grand military parade.

They emerged to accuse the president of racism for highlighting black families whose teens were slain by MS-13 gang members.\u201cFrom his racist, demonizing comments on immigrants to the complete lack of any mention in relation to securing our democracy from the Russian government, the speech wasn\u2019t new, it wasn\u2019t good and it won\u2019t change any fundamental dynamics of our nation moving forward,\u201d said Rep.

In 2009, Rep.

Mr. Trump should have let him have time to prepare his own face-saving announcement.\nBut more important, the former ExxonMobil chairman should never have agreed to serve in this administration in the first place, given his dislike of so much of what Mr. Trump ran on.\nAnd given Mr. Tillerson\u2019s inability to subordinate his views to those of his boss, the only one of the two whom Americans elected to conduct foreign policy. The president appointed Mr. Tillerson to carry out the president\u2019s foreign policy, not Mr. Tillerson\u2018s.\nIt\u2019s astounding that the former CEO of world\u2019s biggest oil company doesn\u2019t understand the constitutional role of a secretary of state. The only policy role of the occupant of that office is to offer his own policy advice to the president, in private, and then carry out whatever the president decides without mumbles, grumbles or winces.\nWhy?\nFor the sake of the American government\u2019s credibility, abroad and at home. The only reason foreign governments pay any attention to the U.S. secretary of state is that they are convinced he speaks for the president.\nThat belief faltered almost immediately.\nAs a candidate, Mr. Trump made it clear to all but the terminally stupid that he would tear up the Iran nuclear deal if elected.\nOnce sworn in, Mr. Tillerson committed the unforgivable sin of publicly disagreeing with Mr. Trump on this. \u201cHe and I have differences of views on things like [the Iran deal] and how we should use it,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said.\nMr. Trump was unwise to appoint a man so at odds with the president on so important an issue, but Mr. Tillerson had no excuse for disputing his boss publicly. That moment would have been a good time for Mr. Trump to whisper \u201cyou\u2019re fired.\u201d\nThe belief that the State Department speaks for the president also faltered after four Arab countries severed relations with a fifth, Qatar, for its funding terrorism, Mr. Tillerson urged all five to settle differences in order to get on with the fight against terrorism. Mr. Trump sided publicly with the four against Qatar. This was not a good-bad cop tactic but sloppy message coordination by the administration.\nYou can\u2019t have the secretary of state and the president publicly disagreeing. It diminished the seriousness with which foreign governments take the pronouncements, policy statements and, yes, the threats uttered by U.S. government.\nIn this case, Mr. Trump should have cooled his twitter finger. He should have quietly persuaded Mr. Tillerson to resort to diplo-speak to establish in subsequent statements that he really agrees with Mr. Trump and always has on Qatar. Either that or resign.\nThe fault lies, unequally, with both men. Mr. Tillerson should have cleared his Qatar view with Mr. Trump before going public. Mr. Trump should have resolved the situation privately with Mr. Tillerson.\nLast summer, Mr. Trump yanked the U.S. out of the Obama-approved Paris climate accord. Mr. Tillerson publicly disagreed.\nA secretary of state less full of himself would have resigned. A president less loath to pull the trigger would have eased Mr. Tillerson back into private life right then and there.\nAgain last summer, Mr. Trump said of the Afghanistan war, \u201cOur troops will fight to win. We will fight to win. From now on, victory will have a clear definition: attacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing Al Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan, and stopping mass terror attacks against America before they emerge.\u201d\nMr. Tillerson addressed the Taliban this way: \u201cYou will not win a battlefield victory. We may not win one, but neither will you. So at some point, we have to come to the negotiating table and find a way to bring this to an end.\u201d\nNothing wrong with the Tillerson statement \u2014 if he had the common sense to have uttered it privately and solely to Mr. Trump.\nMr. Tillerson never revealed such common sense. He ultimately got what common sense said he had coming.\nThe Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

Two other federal judges in California and New York have ruled the phaseout illegal, while one in Maryland ruled it legal.\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke announced the phaseout Sept. 5, citing a letter from Mr. Sessions that told her to rescind DACA because it lacked legal backing.\nIn his letter, Mr. Sessions said DACA \u201cwas an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the executive branch.\u201d He pointed to a ruling by a federal appeals court in 2015 that found a similar deportation amnesty for millions of additional illegal immigrants \u2014 a program called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans.\n\u201cBecause the DACA policy has the same legal and constitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA, it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar results with respect to DACA,\u201d Mr. Sessions said.\nBut Judge Bates said that was wrong. He said while courts had ruled DAPA was illegal because it cut procedural corners, no court had ruled it unconstitutional.\n\u201cSo the attorney general is not correct\u201d on how the 5th Circuit judges ruled, Judge Bates demanded of Kathryn C. Davis, a Justice Department lawyer.\nShe concurred: \u201cIt was an error to assert they reached a constitutional issue.\u201d\nJudge Bates isn\u2019t the first to call Mr. Sessions on the error in the memo.\nThe federal judge in New York who ruled against the phaseout last month also said Mr. Sessions got the legal issues wrong.\nThe Justice Department is appealing that ruling, and in briefs filed last week government lawyers said the mistake was \u201cplainly harmless.\u201d\nThe government said Ms. Duke would have gone through with the phaseout based on the rest of the information she saw beyond Mr. Sessions\u2019 letter, including the 5th Circuit\u2019s DAPA ruling and threats by conservative states to sue over DACA.\nIn a statement to The Washington Times after Wednesday\u2019s hearing, the Justice Department said Mr. Sessions\u2019 letter was intended to reflect his own legal conclusions.\n\u201cRead in its entirety, the attorney general\u2019s letter should not be interpreted as attributing constitutional holdings to the Texas courts, but rather as invoking the legal grounds they adopted in support of his own view that DACA was unconstitutional,\u201d the department said. \u201cAs the department of Justice correctly explained at argument, DACA violates separation of powers principles because the executive branch is taking action that Congress had chosen not to allow.\u201d\nLegal analysts have faulted the government\u2019s approach to defending the phaseout in courts.\nJosh Blackman, an associate professor at the South Texas College of Law, has called parts of Mr. Sessions\u2019 letter \u201cconfounding,\u201d and has written that the Justice Department isn\u2019t arguing it properly in the cases.\nMr. Blackman also wondered why the Justice Department has not rescinded an Office of Legal Counsel opinion issued in 2014 declaring DACA and DAPA legal.\nJudge Bates wondered the same thing, saying he\u2019d been looking in either Mr. Sessions\u2019 or Ms. Duke\u2019s documents for an explanation of why they were ignoring the OLC.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not there,\u201d he said.\nThe Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

The charges stemmed from his stonewalling and lying to Congress as he scrambled to keep investigators away from any evidence that might link a major Obama administration scandal directly to the White House.\nMaybe that\u2019s what a president\u2019s \u201cwing man\u201d does and Mr. Obama certainly got protection from Mr. Holder whenever he needed it.  Mr. Holder has actually always been prone to confusing loyalty to the law and to his boss for decades.\nAfter serving as a U.S. attorney, he moved to main Justice as deputy attorney general during the Clinton years and was key to Mr. Clinton\u2019s pardon of billionaire fugitive Marc Rich just before he left office. The New York Times called the Rich pardon \u201ca shocking abuse of presidential power.\u201d\nMarc Rich made much of his money by illegally buying $200 million dollars\u2019 worth of embargoed Iranian oil while that country was holding 53 Americans hostage. He made secret and incredibly profitable deals with the apartheid regime in South Africa and the totalitarian governments of Libya and North Korea, and when indicted, owed the U.S. some $48 million in taxes.\nMr. Rich and his cronies were major contributors to the Bill Clinton machine and many believed that they bought Mr. Rich the pardon President Clinton signed just before turning the Oval Office over to George W. Bush in 2001.\nThe president has the authority to issue pardons on his own, but virtually all pardons come only after consultations with Justice Department officials and the prosecutors who bring the charges in the first place. Justice or anyone in the building save Mr. Holder would have opposed the Rich pardon had they known it was in the works, but Mr. Holder, then serving as Mr. Clinton\u2019s wing man, kept them all out of the loop for more than two months until it was a fait accompli.\nThe outrage at Mr. Holder\u2019s role in the pardon scandal shook him so badly that he told a Washington Post reporter \u201cI\u2019m done. Public life is over for me,\u201d adding that all he wanted to do was \u201ccrawl into bed and pull the covers up over my head.\u201d The country would have been better off had he done so, but it was not to be.\nLooking for his own \u201cwing man\u201d in 2009, President Barack Obama resurrected Mr. Holder over the objections of fellow liberals like columnist Richard Cohen who were appalled at his role in the Rich pardon. Mr. Obama sent Mr. Holder right back to Justice to cover for him the way he had for Mr. Clinton.\nIn no time the Justice Department with Mr. Holder at the helm dropped a lawsuit against the New Black Panther Party for voter intimidation, refused to prosecute  Lois Lerner when it was revealed that her division of the IRS was targeting Tea Party and other conservative organizations for ideological and political reasons, and blocked the \u201cFast  Furious\u201d gun walking investigation that resulted in more than 60 deaths and earned him his contempt of Congress citation.\nThe former attorney general confided to those tuning in over the weekend that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is a close friend who has already decided to indict President Donald Trump for obstruction of justice, but is waiting because he doesn\u2019t yet have the evidence yet. That\u2019s certainly the way Mr. Holder\u2019s Justice worked and he no doubt believes Mr. Mueller approaches investigations looking for evidence to support conclusions already reached.\nMr. Trump can only hope that Mr. Mueller takes his job and oath more seriously. Still, if Mr. Holder is the close friend he claims to be his remarks should convince Mr. Mueller that he like the rest of us would certainly be better off if his friend would even at this late date crawl into bed and pull up the covers.\n\u2022 David A.

Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, issued a declassified memo on Feb. 2. It said the FBI relied greatly on Mr. Steele\u2019s discredited Democrat-financed dossier to obtain a surveillance warrant on Mr. Page.\nTo bolster the dossier\u2019s charge that Mr. Page met with two Kremlin figures in Moscow, the FBI cited the Yahoo News article, which said the same thing.\nBut the Nunes memo said the FBI, in its Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act application, wasn\u2019t corroborating the dossier because the Page accusation in Yahoo came from the same source: Mr. Steele.\n\u201cThe Carter Page FISA application also cited extensively a September 23, 2016 Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff, which focuses on Page\u2019s July 2016 trip to Moscow,\u201d the memo states. \u201cThis article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News.\u201d\nMr. Nunes cited Mr. Steele\u2019s testimony, through his attorneys, in a London court case in which he is being sued for libel.\nThen came a Democratic rebuttal from Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, a leading dossier supporter.\nMr. Schiff, the House intelligence committee\u2019s top Democrat, said Republicans failed to \u201ccite evidence that Steele disclosed to Yahoo details included in the FISA warrant, since the British Court filings to which they refer do not address what Steele may have said to Yahoo.\u201d\nThis assertion is important to Democrats. They are trying to bolster the FBI as it pursues collusion charges between the Trump campaign and Russia, and also support Mr. Steele, whose unverified accusations they have repeatedly cited.\nThe two pieces of evidence that say Mr. Steele was in fact the source:\n\u2981 In the London court case, Mr. Steele acknowledged that he came to the U.S. in September 2016 at the request of Fusion GPS, which paid him with Democratic Party money. He met with a number of major news representatives, including The New York Times and The Washington Post as he tried to sell his explosive charges. Included in Mr. Steele\u2019s list of appointments was a meeting with Mr. Isikoff.\nMr. Isikoff subsequently wrote a story that matched the dossier. Both the dossier and the Yahoo story said Mr. Page met with two U.S.-sanctioned Russians, Rosneft oil chief Igor Sechin and Vladimir Putin aide Igor Diveykin. Mr. Isikoff sourced the information not to Mr. Steele but to a \u201cWestern intelligence source.\u201d\nMr. Page, whose trip to Moscow was for a public speech at a university, has repeatedly denied under oath that he met the two men. The former Moscow resident and energy investor has decried the investigation into him, including the nearly one-year-long wiretap, which he says found no wrongdoing.\n\u2981 After Mr. Schiff wrote his rebuttal to the Nunes memo on Jan. 31, Mr. Isikoff, a longtime journalist in Washington with a number of scoops to his credit, posted an edition of his podcast, \u201cSkullduggery,\u201d on Feb. 2. Through the Nunes memo, Mr. Isikoff had just learned and said he was surprised that the FBI relied on his article before the FISA court judge.\nHe told about being summoned by his \u201cold friend,\u201d Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson, to a private room in a Washington hotel to meet the former spy from Britain.\n\u201cSteele tells me an amazing story,\u201d Mr. Isikoff said. \u201cOne of Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy advisers, Carter Page, had flown to Moscow and held private talks with close associates of Vladimir Putin about lifting U.S. sanctions against Russia. And Steele tells me something else that day that gets my attention. He has taken this information to the FBI, and the bureau is very interested. Why were they interested? What did the bureau know that would prompt them to take the next step of launching an investigation into an adviser to the Republican nominee for president?\u201d\nMr. Isikoff subsequently wrote the article that ended up in the FBI\u2019s FISA petition. His podcast sealed the case for Mr. Nunes.\nThis prompts the question: Why did the FBI believe that the dossier section about Mr. Page and the Isikoff article came from collaborating sources?\nThe answer lies in a declassified referral sent to the Justice Department from Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican.\nThe two said the evidence suggests that Mr. Steele lied to the FBI when he denied being the source. They have asked the Justice Department to investigate him.\n\u201cThe FBI repeatedly represented to the court that Mr. Steele told the FBI he did not have unauthorized contacts with the press about the dossier prior to October 2016,\u201d the senators\u2019 referral said. \u201cThe FISA applications make these claims specifically in the context of the September 2106 Yahoo News article. But Mr. Steele has admitted \u2014 publicly before a court of law \u2014 that he did have such contacts with the press at this time and his former business partner Mr. Simpson has confirmed it to the committee.\u201d\nThe referral says that the FBI either submitted false information or \u201cMr. Steele made materially false statements to the FBI when he claimed he provided the dossier information only to his business partner and the FBI.\u201d\nThe Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

They found three men inside: the driver (a 20-year-old man who\u2019d had DACA status but it had expired) and two illegal immigrants.The driver admitted he was involved in human smuggling, authorities said.Last year Border Patrol agents manning a highway checkpoint in Texas snared two Dreamers in separate smuggling cases.To qualify for the DACA program illegal immigrants must assert they were brought to the U.S. as children and have kept a relatively clean record.Immigrant-smuggling violates the terms of the agreement, as does gang membership or other serious crimes of violence.As of this summer, some 2,139 Dreamers had had their DACA status revoked, out of nearly 800,000 people who\u2019d been approved for the program \u2014 an incredibly low rate of about a quarter of 1 percent.Still, the arrests come at a touchy time in negotiations, with Democrats arguing Dreamers should be granted full citizenship rights and President Trump saying that must be coupled with strict border security and other immigration policy changes.None of the identities of the Dreamers were released in any of the cases.Homeland Security said the active Dreamer in the San Diego smuggling incident is being processed for deportation, while the Dreamer with the expired DACA status is \u201ccurrently being held in federal custody.\u201d\n                 LOAD COMMENTS ()\n              HIDE COMMENTS", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Victor Morton", "body": "The former commander of the Army\u2019s 1st Armored Division doesn\u2019t want to see a French- or Chinese-style military parade on the streets of Washington, saying such events are not in the U.S. military\u2019s DNA.Retired Lt.

Before that it was Democrats furious at the FBI\u2019s handling of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s email failures.In between were a slew of embarrassing text messages from an agent involved in both the Trump and Clinton investigations, revelations of top officials\u2019 partisan ties, and a wave of demotions and ousters.\u201cIf people start looking at the FBI as a political organization the taint will be incredible,\u201d said James Wedick, a 34-year agency veteran who now works as an investigator.Credibility allegations have taken a toll on the bureau. The New York Times last week published a piece from Josh Campbell, a former supervisory special agent who said informants may be less willing to come forward in a terrorist investigation, or a jury may not give an agent testifying at trial the same expectation of truth it once would have.Mr. Campbell wrote the piece to announce he was quitting the FBI in order to take a public role in defending it, blaming President Trump and his allies for unfairly sullying the bureau.\u201cA small number of my current and retired colleagues have said that we should simply keep our heads down until the storm passes. I say this with the greatest respect: They are wrong,\u201d Mr. Campbell wrote. \u201cIf those who know the agency best remain silent, it will be defined by those with partisan agendas.\u201dEx-agents\u2019 disagreements over the cause of the taint spills over into the prescription for fixing it.One agent said the usual oversight process may help restore confidence, while another said it\u2019ll take FBI Director Christopher Wray to step in and fix things. Another agent said it may take a special prosecutor to get to the bottom of the bureau\u2019s behavior.\u201cIt looks to me like some FBI executives violated the law by filing a fraudulent affidavit to spy on an American citizen,\u201d said Mr. Wedick. \u201cThat\u2019s going to warrant a special prosecutor. I don\u2019t see how they avoid this.\u201dIf a special prosecutor is not appointed, Lewis Schiliro, former head of agency\u2019s New York office, suggests using the inspector general to release a comprehensive report on the FBI\u2019s activities.But Sanford Unger, director of the Free Speech Program at Georgetown University and author of a book on the FBI\u2019s history, said a special prosecutor would further politicize the battle over the bureau\u2019s behavor.\u201cAnother line of independent inquiry that is subject to political manipulation is not a good idea,\u201d Mr. Unger said. \u201cTo inject another probe could risk harming the bureau in ways that even Mr. Trump wouldn\u2019t want it harmed.\u201dHe said Mr. Trump could help restore faith in the bureau by cooling his criticisms, which Mr. Unger described as short-term political calculations.\u201cIf you tear down an institution like this you can\u2019t just build it back up next week,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to be careful about tearing down institutions that are the bedrock of our democracy because you will cause irreparable damage to the government that maligned it.\u201dThe latest dent to the bureau came on Friday when a House intelligence committee memo claimed the FBI applied for a FISA warrant to spy on Trump campaign aide Carter Page using the discredited Steele Dossier, a collection of unverified reports which was funded by the Clinton campaign for use against Mr. Trump.\u201cThere was a perception that the FBI had lost its objectivity with how it handled the Hillary Clinton investigation and now the FISA memo just adds to that,\u201d Mr. Schiliro said.Politicians of every stripe, from Mr. Trump on down, insist they aren\u2019t questioning the integrity of the 13,000 agents, 3,100 intelligence analysts and 19,000 other support staff.But the leadership has been in turmoil for months, with Mr. Trump firing then-Director James Comey last year, and Deputy Attorney General Andrew McCabe speeding up his retirement this year amid allegations he slow walked the Clinton email investigation.The inspector general is reviewing why Mr. McCabe, the second-highest-ranking official at the FBI \u201cappeared not to act for about three weeks\u201d after new Clinton emails were discovered just weeks before the election. Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife, Jill, ran for state senate in Virginia and had accepted a campaign contribution of nearly $500,000 from Gov. Terry McCauliffe, Virginia Democrat, who chaired Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign.\u201cWhen I was at the bureau, the question was never \u2018is it wrong?,\u2019 it was \u2018does this look wrong?\u2019\u201d Mr. Wedick said. \u201cIf it didn\u2019t look good you weren\u2019t allowed do that. How McCabe\u2019s wife took that money, given his position, is incredible to me.\u201dThe FBI\u2019s troubles deepened last year when Agent Peter Strzok was revealed to have sent bureau attorney Lisa Page, his alleged mistress, multiple texts in support of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential aspirations, while simultaneously blasting Donald Trump.Mr. Strzok was the agent running the investigation into Mrs. Clinton use of a private email server while Secretary of State and, briefly, a member of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team probing possible links between Russia and Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.The agency\u2019s embarrassment over the situation was heightened last month when it admitted last month that it lost nearly five months worth of texts exchanged between Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page due to \u201cmisconfiguration issues.\u201d It took the FBI\u2019s inspector general to recover the missing texts.\u201cHow does the FBI - with the top cybersecurity technology in the world - go to the microphone and announce the texts are missing?\u201d Mr. Wedick said. \u201cThat just gives everyone an insecure feeling that they have no idea what they are doing.\u201dMr. Schiliro said the bad publicity surrounding the bureau is because of the actions of a few top level officials.\u201cThe working agents are out there every day, doing their job and leaving politics at the door,\u201d Mr. Schiliro said. \u201cBut perhaps Comey and others at the top allowed this continue unimpeded.\u201dJohn Lagito, who spent 20 years at the Bureau, said it\u2019s up to Mr. Comey\u2019s successor to restore confidence.\u201cWray just needs to clean house now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe FBI needs to heal and show everyone who the bad apples are.\u201dMr. Lagito accused Mr. Wray of being slow to act, noting that Mr. McCabe did not leave until allegations of his alleged slow walking the Clinton e-mail investigation surfaced or that Mr. Strzok was transferred only after his texts to Ms. Page were disclosed.\u201cJust the affair allegations, which may or may not be true, would have been enough to have an agent suspended when I was at the bureau,\u201d he said.The former agents believe arrests in high-profile FBI investigations could heal some wounds. But such announcements could take a while and may be overshadowed in the media by the political climate in Washington.\u201cA string of good news will impact the public,\u201d Mr. Schiliro said. \u201cI guarantee you that discussion is going on in the director\u2019s office.\u201d\n                 LOAD COMMENTS ()\n              HIDE COMMENTS", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Rowan Scarborough", "body": "A Republican senator on Monday released an unpublished portion of the infamous Trump-Russia dossier that showed Hillary Clinton associates fed information to the author, former British spy Christopher Steele.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairmen Charles Grassley posted the heavily redacted referral he sent to the Justice Department asking for a criminal probe into whether Mr. Steele lied to the FBI.In the referral is a reference to an Oct. 19, 2016 memo Mr. Steele wrote.

Constitutional rights and civil liberties be damned if they get in the way of a phony political hitjob against a political opponent!And in case anyone wondered whether former FBI Director James B. Comey had a shred of integrity left, he settled the issue with a tweet.\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d he inquired. Of the memo that explained how Obama justice officials used Russian-manufactured propaganda paid for by Democrats and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign to apply for a warrant to spy on a private citizen working for the campaign of then-candidate Donald Trump.Yeah, that was it, Jimmy Boy. The fact you are not shocked and outraged by it all only reveals just how thoroughly corrupted you have become.Still, people who read the memo are standing around scratching their heads trying to figure out what \u201csources and methods\u201d might have actually been revealed by the publication of the memo.Best they can come up with is a Yahoo News story based on information leaked from the Kremlin-backed, U.S. Democrat-funded \u201cDirty Dossier\u201d that was used \u2014 at least in part, according to the Republican memo \u2014 to obtain a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant to spy on a low-level Trump campaign adviser.Now was this a \u201csource\u201d or a \u201cmethod\u201d?If Yahoo News (not to be confused with the delicious cold chocolate drink Yoo-hoo) is a \u201csource\u201d for America\u2019s top intelligence services, then perhaps they should consider getting better sources.Or was Yahoo News a \u201cmethod\u201d? Meaning, America\u2019s intel geniuses knowingly used \u201cnews\u201d from Yahoo News that was leaked from a bogus partisan dossier written by the Kremlin and paid for by the Democrats?If that\u2019s the case they need better methods, too.The real \u201csources and methods\u201d exposed by the Republican memo, I fear, is the most obvious one: the FISA court itself.The real reason American intelligence officials worked so feverishly to conceal the GOP memo is that it exposes a dangerous disregard for American liberties and constitutional rights when it comes to spooks applying for search warrants on American citizens, raising serious questions about the entire FISA process.If the spies seeking these warrants are not more forthcoming and honest and the judges granting these warrants are not more demanding and suspicious, then the whole process should be completely overhauled.In the meantime, all of it should be exposed to sunlight. And that includes declassifying and releasing all the search warrants relating to this whole snake-bit Russia \u201ccollusion\u201d investigation.\u2022 Charles Hurt can be reached at [email\u00a0protected] and on Twitter @charleshurt.\n                 LOAD COMMENTS ()\n              HIDE COMMENTS", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Rowan Scarborough", "body": "Through targeted subpoenas and threatening letters, Rep. Devin Nunes has forced into the open a fuller story of how the Obama administration investigated suspected Russian ties to the Trump campaign and monitored people connected to the presidential candidate.The White House now has in its hands Mr. Nunes\u2019 latest revelation: his top-secret, four-page memo outlining supposed abuses in the Justice Department during months of Trump surveillance.Whether it was how the FBI used a Democrat-financed dossier or why the special counsel fired his top FBI agent or how many Trump associates were \u201cunmasked\u201d in wiretap spying, Mr. Nunes has unearthed facts that otherwise likely would have remained hidden.Democrats, led by Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, have pounced on Mr. Nunes for veering from the Trump-Russia collusion narrative to one of, they say, protecting President Trump.Mr. Schiff has relied heavily on the unverified Russia-sourced dossier to frame the investigation and interrogate witnesses. He has resisted all of Mr. Nunes\u2019 efforts to find out who paid for the dossier, who read it during the campaign or how the FBI relied on it to open its investigation.John Heilemann, a member of the mainstream media punditry, seemed to have reached the height of liberal frustration Tuesday when he suggested that Mr. Nunes was a Russian agent.\u201cIs it possible that we actually have a Russian agent running the House intel committee on the Republican side?\u201d Mr. Heilemann said on MSNBC. \u201cHe\u2019s behaving like someone who\u2019s been compromised, and there are people in the intelligence community and others with great expertise in this area who look at him and say, \u2018That guy\u2019s been compromised.\u2019\u201dMr. Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, won a Republican-majority vote Monday to release his memo, distilled from thousands of pages of secret documents. It details what he and other Republicans say were inappropriate actions by the FBI hierarchy and the Justice Department.The clock is ticking. The White House can opt to release the memo after a mandatory five-day review.To acquire access to the documents over a number of months, Mr. Nunes wrote letters accusing the Justice Department and the FBI of a cover-up, threatened to hold them in contempt and won as an ally House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican.Among Mr. Nunes\u2019 discoveries:The dossierOne of the most important, salacious and unverified documents in modern political history, the dossier begged the question, who paid its bills? Its 35 pages claim a wide criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence to hack Democratic Party computers. After more than a year, the FBI has not substantiated this.Mr. Nunes subpoenaed the bank records of investigative firm Fusion GPS, which paid dossier writer Christopher Steele, a former British spy. Fusion went to U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to block the move.The court battle flushed out D.C. law firm Perkins Coie LLP, which filed a letter disclosing it had financed Fusion\u2019s work with money from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.With that mystery solved, Republicans are trying to determine who used the dossier\u2019s scandalous information against Mr. Trump.Peter StrzokIn July, special counsel Robert Mueller fired Peter Strzok, a counterintelligence specialist and the top FBI agent in his Russia collusion investigation. Mr. Strzok was banished to the FBI\u2019s human resources branch.Mr. Nunes pressed the FBI for months to explain but received no response.On Dec. 1, retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to an FBI agent \u2014 Mr. Strzok \u2014 about whether he discussed sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The next day, the reason for Mr. Strzok\u2019s reassignment appeared in the press.Again urged on by Republicans, the Justice Department began releasing a series of text messages between Mr. Strzok and his lover, Lisa Page, chief legal counsel to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.The lovers talked of an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d against Mr. Trump and the activation of a \u201csecret society\u201d after his election victory. Ms. Page referred to Mr. Trump as a \u201cmenace.\u201dThe Justice Department inspector general obtained the messages from the pair\u2019s FBI cellphones. He has been investigating the FBI\u2019s handling of its probe into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s exclusive use of private email servers, rather than the state.gov domain, to conduct official business.The next step: Interview Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page to determine if they acted on their biases against Mr. Trump.Bruce and Nellie OhrMr. Nunes\u2019 inquiry dug up the fact that Mr. Ohr, a senior Justice Department official, met with Mr. Steele, the dossier writer, during the presidential campaign. At the same time, Mr. Ohr\u2019s wife, Nellie, a Russian scholar, worked for Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson. It is presumed she worked on the firm\u2019s opposition research to bring down candidate Trump.After the election, Mr. Ohr met with Mr. Simpson, though Mr. Ohr was not assigned to the Russia probe. Since the Fusion-Ohr disclosures, Fox News reported that he has been demoted for failing to disclose the meetings.UnmaskingMr. Nunes\u2019 investigative journey began in March with a trip to the White House to view classified documents. The documents pertained to unmasking, the process whereby senior government officials can request that a transcript of intercepted foreign communication be unredacted to reveal a U.S. person\u2019s name.Mr. Nunes discovered that National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice and U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power made hundreds of such requests, some of which pertained to Trump associates.Republicans say Mr. Nunes\u2019 investigation led directly to reforms in how officials can request identities of citizens unintentionally collected in foreign surveillance. The director of national intelligence now requires a higher level of approval before a name is revealed and disseminated.The news media criticized Mr. Nunes for visiting the White House. A liberal group filed a complaint with the House Ethics Committee, which conducted an investigation and cleared him.FBI conductThe next step is the release of the four-page memo produced by Mr. Nunes and his Republican colleagues.Republicans who read the document after signing nondisclosure agreements said it addresses the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and whether the dossier\u2019s information was used to obtain warrants.Rep. Trey Gowdy, South Carolina Republican and a member of the House intelligence committee, summed it up this way on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d: \u201cIf you think your viewers want to know whether or not the dossier was used in court proceedings, whether or not it was vetted before it was used, whether or not it\u2019s ever been vetted, if you are interested in who paid for the dossier, if you are interested in Christopher Steele\u2019s relationship with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee, then, yes, you will want the memo to come out.\u201dIt has been reported that Carter Page, a Trump campaign volunteer, was surveilled under FISA. The Steele dossier accuses Mr. Page of a series of collusion crimes, all of which he denies. He has filed a libel lawsuit against media outlets that reported the unconfirmed claims.In the 2000s, Mr. Page worked in Moscow as a Merrill Lynch banker. A New York energy investor, he visited Moscow in early July 2016 to deliver a public speech. He is generally pro-Russia and a critic of U.S.-imposed sanctions.Mr. Page provided a statement to The Washington Times: \u201cThe unfortunate attacks against Chairman Nunes represent the essence of the McCarthyism that has recently reemerged. For those who try accusing the Chairman of partisanship, at least his investigation\u2019s recent conclusions in the forthcoming memo allegedly focus on hard facts. In doing so, the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s findings should finally help America make a giant leap forward beyond the DNC-funded propaganda that has deceptively dominated the news for over a year already.\u201d\n                 LOAD COMMENTS ()\n              HIDE COMMENTS", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "S.a.

A more reasonable argument is that Mrs. Clinton wasn\u2019t macho enough to make it to the White House.At a Columbia University Women\u2019s Conference event on Sunday, Justice Ginsburg was asked again about the 2016 election, to which she opined, according to Fox News Insider, \u201d \u2018I think it was difficult for Hillary Clinton to get by even the macho atmosphere prevailing during that campaign, and she was criticized in a way I think no man would have been criticized,\u2019 Justice Ginsburg said. \u2018I think anyone who watched that campaign unfold would answer it the same way I did: Yes, sexism played a prominent part,\u2019 she continued.\u201dMrs. Clinton wasn\u2019t the only loser of the 2016 season. Does Justice Ginsburg think former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are all casualties of machismo? Perhaps their own lack of it. When voters looked at the world, we wisely decided against sending anyone who needed a safe space, face-planted into a van, or was low-energy, into the vipers\u2019 pit of the world.Political campaigns are about getting to know the candidates, but more than that, we find out in those environments who can handle the heat, and who can\u2019t. If Justice Ginsburg\u2019s wronged Hillary Clinton (or anyone else, for that matter) couldn\u2019t handle an unconventional, swaggering and confident American billionaire, how could she handle the world itself?Americans decided she couldn\u2019t. And not because of machismo, but because she doesn\u2019t have the fortitude to face all that the world throws at the American president. The fact that we can\u2019t ask the late U.S. Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ability to handle the tyrants and terrorists, tells you everything you need to know.It\u2019s leadership that empowers generals to do their job and wipe out the savages of ISIS. It\u2019s leadership that orders a roundup of the terrorist gang MS-13. It\u2019s leadership that forces Congress to do right by the American people with massive tax reform reinvigorating our economy and giving the future back to the American people. It\u2019s leadership that puts America first. If Justice Ginsburg wants to call all that machismo, fine. We\u2019ll take that over safe spaces any day.Mrs. Clinton and her little team of enablers are still wandering the forest clutching their pearls and gnashing their teeth over how the election was stolen from them.Mrs. Clinton, so completely unprepared for the White House, continues to reveal the actual reason for her massive failure: a complete lack of self-awareness brought on in part by a political system that for far too long had manipulated the environment guaranteeing certain outcomes.Mrs. Clinton and her two-time failed, little ragtag team can\u2019t accept the election results even now because they had already planned the rest of their lives. When they began their cruise to the White House, hitting an iceberg was the last thing they expected.An entire world of Democratic career bureaucrats, campaign workers and party operatives were all ready for the rest of their powerful and money-drenched lives. They expected at least eight more years of running the world, getting book deals, having who knows how many more billions of dollars pour in the Clinton Foundation. Then a cozy retirement on the taxpayers\u2019 dime for the rest of their lives rounded out the perfect plan.Until those deplorable Americans decided otherwise.After relying on Americans doing what they\u2019re told by your celebrity friends and colluding media, I suppose Mrs. Clinton can be forgiven for being confused, and that confusion still prevails. Newsweek reported she is planning on returning to the campaign trail to support candidates for the 2018 midterm elections. Yet, \u201c[d]espite plans to campaign for some Democrats, advisors and friends of Clinton said the former secretary of state wants to keep a low enough profile so as not to attract criticism from Republican candidates,\u201d according to the newsweekly.In other words, Mrs. Clinton will be hiding while she\u2019s helping. The woman who insists she could be president is still too unsure and too afraid to get out of the van. That\u2019s not machismo keeping her down, it\u2019s her own lack of character.Reflecting what most Democrats must now think, a Politico headline from this week blares, \u201cHillary Clinton Needs to Move On: Why is one of the most qualified leaders in the world continuing to let Trump define her, when she could be changing the subject?\u201dHere\u2019s a possibility: President Trump isn\u2019t defining Mrs. Clinton at all. Let\u2019s give the woman a little credit, shall we? Hillary Clinton is defining Hillary Clinton. The answer to Politico\u2019s question is simple, and not macho at all: Mrs. Clinton has failed and is failing now because she is not one of the most qualified leaders in the world.

Anything short of enforcing existing laws \u2014 anything short of that would be a slap in the face to not just our angel moms and dads, but every single American that voted for him,\u201d said Maria Espinoza, national director for the Remembrance Project.The project\u2019s angel moms and dads are parents whose children have been killed by illegal immigrants \u2014 in some cases people the same age as the Dreamers Mr. Trump is talking about granting full citizenship rights.They embraced Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign and appeared on stage with him at major immigration speeches and at the Republican nominating convention.\u201cHe knows very well by sitting in front of these families and holding their hands and speaking with them how our justice system mishandled cases and this violent illegal alien was released back into the community,\u201d Ms. Espinoza told The Washington Times.\u201cHe knows we want existing laws enforced,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have laws already on the books that are not being enforced.\u201dThe White House said Mr. Trump was making major concessions in envisioning citizenship for 1.8 million Dreamers. But officials said that was the price they figured they would have to pay to get the security and policy changes Mr. Trump wants, including an end to the Diversity Visa Lottery and limits to the chain of family migration.\u201cThis is the most centrist proposal on immigration that\u2019s ever been put forth in Washington,\u201d one senior White House official told reporters in laying out the details.Immigrant rights groups, though, blasted Mr. Trump and top policy adviser Stephen Miller, a major figure in the White House on immigration, for the plan.Lorella Praeli, director of immigration policy at the American Civil Liberties Union, called the White House blueprint \u201chateful\u201d and \u201cxenophobic.\u201d\u201cStephen Miller has said that his proposal is \u2018extremely generous,\u2019 but the only community that benefits from this supposed generosity are white supremacists,\u201d she said.Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez, Illinois Democrat, said Mr. Trump might as well spend the $25 billion he is asking for a border wall \u201cto erect a 50-foot concrete statue of a middle finger and point it toward Latin America.\u201d\u201cBoth a wall and the statue would be equally offensive and equally ineffective, and both would express Trump\u2019s deeply held suspicion of Latinos,\u201d he said.Frank Sharry, executive director of America\u2019s Voice, said the White House plan would cut legal immigration by 50 percent, as well as pursue changes that would make it tougher for illegal immigrants who dislike the poverty and violence in their home countries to claim asylum in the U.S.\u201cPresident Trump and Stephen Miller are exploiting a crisis that they created so they can take a wrecking ball to the Statue of Liberty,\u201d he said.Polling, though, suggests Mr. Trump may have found the sweet spot on immigration. A survey from Harris-Harvard released this week found that Americans generally want a border wall system, strongly want to end the Diversity Visa Lottery and overwhelmingly want to legalize Dreamers and cut chain migration.\n                 LOAD COMMENTS ()\n              HIDE COMMENTS", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Stephen Dinan", "body": "Democrats on the House intelligence committee on Saturday released their memo detailing their version of events that led to the FBI obtaining a warrant to snoop into a former Trump campaign official, arguing the government did not abuse the secret process.\nThe Democrats argued the Justice Department and FBI would actually have been remiss not to target Carter Page, the Trump campaign figure.\nThe memo is meant to counter a GOP-written memo that accused the Justice Department of abusing the secret court process and relying too heavily on a Democratic-funded opposition research dossier to justify the surveillance.\nThe Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

But there is another dynamic at work as well. Politics is also a long march with enduring themes \u2014 which is where books come in.Take, for example, \u201cUnderstanding Trump,\u201d by Newt Gingrich, due in four weeks from Center Street, the conservative imprint of Hachette Books. It features a foreword by the president\u2019s son Eric Trump \u2014 who describes the book as \u201can inside look into possibly the greatest campaign of all time.\u201dMr. Gingrich\u2019s work could provide a thoughtful rebuttal against claims that the president is unpresidential. Mr. Trump is, instead, different. Ironically, many inclusive-minded Democrats are not willing to tolerate this difference.\u201cIt is astonishing to me, as a historian, how the elite media and much of the political establishment refuse to try to understand Donald Trump. They have been so rabidly opposed to him, so ideologically committed to left-wing values, and so terrified of the future that they haven\u2019t stopped and considered how extraordinary his success has been,\u201d writes Mr. Gingrich. \u201cPresident Trump is one of the most remarkable individuals to ever occupy the White House. His set of practical business experiences \u2014 and his lack of traditional political-governmental experiences \u2014 make him a unique president.\u201dMr. Gingrich later advises, \u201cEven today, months after Trump won the election and was sworn in as president, the news media still tries to cover him as if he were a normal politician, and his ideological opponents continue to be viciously dishonest. They are either clueless or lying. Ignore them.\u201dMeanwhile, another book is on the way from Center Street, this titled \u201cLiars, Leakers and Liberals\u201d by Jeanine Pirro.\u201cAs an online commentator and host of her own show on Fox News for many years, Judge Jeanine Pirro has seen firsthand how narratives take form, whether they are based in truth or not,\u201d the publisher advises, noting that the book will identify the most \u201cegregious lies\u201d and the true toll of fake news, plus the falsehoods of modern-day feminists.The author will also explain \u201chow the media has twisted President Trump\u2019s words to fit the narrative they\u2019ve created,\u201d along with damage caused by anonymous sources and White House leaks, and the situation that Mr. Trump \u201cinherited\u201d from former President Barack Obama.Interesting to note that Ms. Pirro had lunch with Mr. Trump at the White House a few days ago, so her own sources are indeed current.FOR THE LEXICON\u201cOnline outrage mobs.\u201dThat\u2019s a handy term identified by Ari Cohn, an attorney and director of the individual rights defense program for Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, an interest group defending freedom of speech on college campuses.Mr. Cohn points out that \u201conline outrage mobs are all the rage recently, standing at the ready to inundate colleges and universities with demands to punish a student or professor the moment they say something that offends others.\u201d\u2018SPYING ON TRUMP\u2019\u201cAmericans overwhelmingly believe the Obama administration \u2018improperly surveilled\u2019 Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and a majority say they would like to see a special prosecutor appointed to look into possible misconduct by the FBI and Department of Justice in spying on Trump,\u201d says a new Investor\u2019s Business Daily editorial, which includes a poll revealing that 55 percent of the respondents said is was likely the Obama administration indeed improperly surveilled the Trump campaign while 54 percent approve of a special counsel to get to the bottom of the matter.\u201cThe poll\u2019s contents are troubling for those in the Democratic Party and the left-leaning media who had hoped to make a case with the American people that President Trump worked with Russian officials to win the 2016 election. The American people don\u2019t seem to believe it,\u201d the editorial suggests.NOTHING BUT CRICKETSSo is the Democratic rebuttal to the House Intelligence Committee memo just gathering dust?\u201cThe White House did not deny the release of the Democrats\u2019 memo. What they did is they said \u2018Look, you need to make some redactions and some technical corrections here, and we will get it out right away,\u201d Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House intelligence committee told Fox News Channel on Sunday.\u201cNow, from that point, we\u2019ve heard nothing but crickets. The Democrats have been on TV all weekend long. Their memo is sitting at the House Intelligence Committee down at the bottom of the Capitol waiting to be redacted. If they really wanted to get it out, they would have been down there all day redacting it, getting it back over to the White House so that the public can know what\u2019s in it.

Mr. Weissmann said in a court filing that Mr. Manafort has expressed doubts that he can \u201cmaintain the payments on all his mortgages.\u201d His Trump Tower condominium is at risk of foreclosure, he said.Mr. Manafort\u2019s attorney, Kevin M. Downing, filed his argument Feb. 16 in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to support his lawsuit against the Justice Department. He is asking District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson to end the special counsel\u2019s investigation of Mr. Manafort.Mr. Downing charges that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein violated the Justice Department\u2019s regulation for special counsels in May when he granted Mr. Mueller an open-ended mandate to investigate matters outside his appointed task: Russia election meddling and any Trump involvement.The pending money-laundering indictment in Washington against Mr. Manafort, President Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, goes back to transactions in 2005 that ended by 2014. The time span is many months before the Republican operative joined the campaign in March 2016.Mr. Downing said his lawsuit against the Justice Department \u201cwas filed shortly after and in direct response to the Special Counsel\u2019s threats to bring additional charges against Mr. Manafort in venues outside the District of Columbia. Those imminent threats cannot be denied.\u201dHis filing adds: \u201cThe government seeks to relegate Mr. Manafort to a game of criminal-procedure whack-a-mole that wastes judicial resources; that cannot offer complete (or even adequate) relief; and that leaves him powerless in any effort to match the government\u2019s resources.\u201dMr. Downing draws a comparison between the excesses of the old \u201cindependent counsel\u201d post with how Mr. Mueller is prosecuting Mr. Manafort.Congress ended the independent counsel law in 1999, and the Department of Justice wrote new regulations for special counsels.The knock on independent counsels was that they essentially set up a quasi-Justice Department with no oversight for an outside lawyer who was free to take years to conclude an investigation and go far afield of the original accusation.Mr. Downing\u2019s filing summed up the reasoning, returning to the issue of \u201cresources\u201d: \u201cA central problem with the independent counsel statute was that it provided essentially unlimited funding to conduct investigations that were essentially unlimited in scope. The Special Counsel Regulations, by contrast, are specifically designed to ensure political oversight over special counsels; to specify the scope of their original jurisdiction; to prevent expansion of that jurisdiction except where authorized by politically accountable officials; and to thereby avoid the overbearing pressures that result when prosecutors, with virtually unlimited resources, focus on a singular target with no competing priorities.\u201dMr. Downing said Mr. Rosenstein veered away from the special counsel regulation by allowing Mr. Mueller to investigate \u201cany matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\u201d\u201cThe Complaint alleges that the Acting Attorney General lacks authority to grant such jurisdiction under the Special Counsel Regulations,\u201d the Manafort filing states. \u201cBecause the DOJ and the Acting Attorney General had no authority to grant the Special Counsel such blanket additional jurisdiction in the original Appointment Order, the Special Counsel has no authority to exercise it.\u201dAn unending investigationMr. Rosenstein appointed Mr. Mueller after Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescued himself from any Trump-Russia investigations.Mr. Mueller\u2019s carte blanche, Mr. Downing said, \u201csubjects [Mr. Manafort] to the threat of investigation after investigation, seizure after seizure, in jurisdiction after jurisdiction, so long as the Special Counsel deems them to have \u2018arisen\u2019 out of the investigation.\u201dFor that matter, Mr. Downing said, it is impossible for the Manafort investigation to have arisen from the Russia-Trump probe.\u201cAlthough Mr. Manafort served as President Trump\u2019s campaign chairman for six months in 2016, he is now being investigated for previously known business conduct that long preceded, and had no connection to, the 2016 presidential election,\u201d he argued.Under Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s order, \u201cThe Special Counsel can continue to investigate and pursue new charges against Mr. Manafort in different districts for conduct that long predates the 2016 presidential election. The Special Counsel has made clear that he intends to do just that,\u201d the attorney said.Mr. Downing said there is no indication that Mr. Mueller is investigating Mr. Manafort in the Russia-Trump matter.The Justice Department is representing Mr. Rosenstein and argues that the district judge lacks authority to end a federal criminal investigation. It argues that Mr. Manafort\u2019s recourse is a motion to dismiss the indictment.Mr. Manafort heads an international political consulting firm and various companies. The grand jury indictment says he used those firms to illegally launder millions of dollars, provided by Ukrainian political clients, from Cyprus banks to domestic accounts.His attorney and Mueller prosecutors are now engaged in a courtroom skirmish over bail and the worth of Manafort properties put up as collateral. Mr. Manafort remains under surveillance and confined to his home in Alexandria, Virginia.The same day Mr. Downing filed his argument, Mr. Weissmann filed a paper accusing Mr. Manafort of bank fraud.Mr. Weissmann charges that a Fairfax, Virginia, property that the defendant plans to cite as bail was acquired through fraudulent applications to the Federal Savings Bank. He said Mr. Manafort provided the bank with \u201cdoctored profit and loss statements\u201d for his consulting firm.The Weissmann motion says Mr. Manafort is withdrawing properties in New York and Florida as collateral and now cites three other ones that \u201care deficient in various respects.\u201dMr. Weissmann said the changes mean the defendant is proposing assets worth far less than the $10 million bail set by the judge.One property in Arlington was purchased for his daughter with \u201ctainted funds from a Cypriot account,\u201d the motion said.What\u2019s more, Mr. Manafort said the Fairfax property holds no mortgage when in fact it does, Mr. Weissmann said.And Mr. Manafort\u2019s Trump Tower condo is at a \u201crisk of bank foreclosure.\u201d\u201cThe fact that Manafort has not been able to find any responsible surety to cosign a bond for this package suggests that neither those closest to him, nor anyone else, is willing to assume the risk of being a surety [guarantee] for him,\u201d Mr. Weissmann said.The Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

His first pick, former Rep. Tom Price, resigned last fall amid questions about his pricey business travel.The Senate confirmed Mr. Azar last week, 55-43.Six Senate Democrats vote to approve Mr. Azar, brushing aside liberal complaints that his history of Obamacare criticism and work for a drugmaker made him the wrong man to implement the 2010 law or tamp down on prescription prices.Sen.

Michael Behenna seeks a shot at redemption. It may be a long shot.\nBehenna\u2019s cause was launched by his attorney on Jan. 17, but the former Ranger\u2019s bid has picked up a lot of high-ranking support. At various times, Behenna has had the support of dozens of generals and admirals across the four branches of armed forces. This month, Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter wrote President Trump requesting a pardon for a native son of his state.\n\u201cI do not believe Lt. Behenna should carry the burden of a miscarriage of justice the rest of his life,\u201d Mr. Hunter said.\nAs far as the military is concerned, there has been no miscarriage. In 2008, while serving in the Sunni Triangle, an improvised explosive device killed two soldiers in Behenna\u2019s command: Spc. Adam Kohlhaas, 20, of Kentucky, and Spc. Steven Christofferson, 20, of Wisconsin. An Iraqi translator and two other Iraqi soldiers allied with U.S. forces also perished.\nEnraged and distraught, the Rangers began combing the enemy infested villages north of Baghdad. Intelligence pointed them to Ali Mansur, a local identified as an al Qaeda operative who was found with weapons and a Syrian passport when soldiers arrested him, according to court briefs. After several days of interrogation, however, military intelligence could not crack the suspect and Behenna was ordered to return Mansur to his home.\nThat was an inexplicable and significant blunder, said John Richter, a King  Spalding partner handling Behenna\u2019s pardon request. It was a mistake to order an officer still reeling from the loss of valuable soldiers under his command to release the suspect he believed guilty.\n\u201cIt was an awful management decision to send Lt. Behenna to return the guy,\u201d Mr. Richter said.\nThe decision went badly awry. In a move even those who support him acknowledge was a ghastly dereliction of duty, Behenna stopped Mansur\u2019s return convoy and took the suspect into a railroad culvert off the main road. There he ordered Mansur to strip and, with an interpreter, began a final interrogation.\nThose facts are not in dispute. What happened next, on the other hand, is: When he turned his attention to the translator, Behenna claims, Mansur leaped to his feet and threw a lump of concrete at his captors in an attempt to escape. In what he called self-defense and Army prosecutors an execution, Behenna shot Mansur twice.\nBehenna was charged with premeditated murder in a combat zone, but that harsh crime wasn\u2019t proved. In his trial at Fort Campbell, a jury found him guilty of the lesser crime of unpremeditated murder in a combat zone. Behenna received a 25-year sentence in the Leavenworth prison.\nIt was a crushing blow and ignoble end to what had been an impeccable and promising military career.\nGrowing up outside of Oklahoma City, Behenna seemed destined to a life of public service. His father was with the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation and was shot in the line of duty when his son was 4. Behenna\u2019s mother was an assistant U.S. attorney who was on the prosecution team that convicted Timothy McVeigh in the Oklahoma City bombing.\nBut something else came out of Behenna\u2019s trial, Mr. Richter said: a prosecutorial error. On the eve of trial, a top forensic investigator hired by the Army concluded that the evidence supported Behenna\u2019s version of events.\nWithout notifying the defense, Army prosecutors quietly scrubbed the investigator from their witness list. When Behenna took the stand in his own defense, his story lacked any buttressing testimony. That was precisely what the investigator would have offered, he told dumbfounded defense attorneys after the trial.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, known as the CAAF, acknowledged that Behenna\u2019s team should have been told that one of the Army\u2019s star witnesses thought the defendant was telling the truth. Yet the error did not influence the trial to the extent that he deserved another one, the appeals judges said in its 3-2 split decision. The appeals court did reduce Behenna\u2019s sentence to 15 years.\nThe court concluded that Behenna forfeited a self-defense claim as he pointed his sidearm at a suspect outside of \u201can active battlefield situation.\u201d That was where 37 flag and general officers, including a former member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, took issue with the court. They said self-defense had to be available to service members in dangerous and unstable situations around the world.\nInstead, the court had \u201ctreated an American soldier\u2019s confrontation with a suspected al-Qaeda operative in a combat zone as no different in principle than a soldier\u2019s stateside barroom brawl,\u201d the generals and admirals wrote. \u201cThat makes no sense because the everyday risks to servicemembers in far-flung combat zones around the world are different in kind from the risks inherent in stateside altercations.\u201d\nThe high-ranking officers argued that Behenna\u2019s conviction would in fact put U.S. service members in peril.\n\u201cUnder the CAAF\u2019s categorical rule, servicemembers who point their weapons without authorization at suspected enemies in a combat zone lose their right to self-defense, and hence must flee if attacked. In this case, if Mansur had overpowered Lieutenant Behenna and seized his weapon, not only Lieutenant Behenna\u2019s life but also the lives of nearby soldiers under his command could have been lost,\u201d the officers wrote. \u201cIf Lieutenant Behenna\u2019s testimony is truthful \u2014 as the decision of the CAAF assumes and this Court must assume \u2014 then Lieutenant Behenna would have been derelict of duty not to use his weapon to defend himself.\u201d\nThe Supreme Court declined to hear Behenna\u2019s case, but the self-defense precedent is germane to the request for pardon, both Mr. Richter and Mr. Hunter say.\nAlthough he believes the Brady violations at Behenna\u2019s trial were significant, Mr. Richter stressed that his goal is not to relitigate the case. Behenna, who through Mr. Richter declined to be interviewed, isn\u2019t trying to do that, either.\nThe reason for the pardon is to lift the cloud on Behenna. A presidential pardon would \u201cnot change the nature of a discharge or expunge a record of conviction,\u201d according to military regulations.\n\u201cHe seeks forgiveness; the pardon is ultimately a form of forgiveness,\u201d Mr. Richter said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t commit any crime; this is not an exoneration.\u201d\nBy all accounts, Behenna has handled his burden well. After his first parole hearing in March 2014, he walked out of Fort Leavenworth, where he was a model prisoner who read voraciously and learned Spanish. Now, he is building a familiar and comfortable Sooner life: working on a 4,000-acre ranch in Medford and regularly visiting his folks in Edmond.\nMr. Richter said it\u2019s absurd to think there is any risk to the public or of recidivism as Behenna completes his probation, yet he has to register as a violent offender and is forbidden from many lines of work because of his status as a felon.\nMr. Hunter said he has encountered nothing but enthusiastic support from fellow Okies for Behenna\u2019s cause. If there are opposing groups, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard of them,\u201d Mr. Hunter said. Local press has also followed Behenna\u2019s saga, often with a largely sympathetic tone.\nIndeed, The Oklahoman, the state\u2019s largest newspaper, said in a January 2014 editorial that it was \u201cconvinced politics played a role in his sentence\u201d and urged Behenna be paroled.\nThe Washington Times sought reaction to the pardon request from several international human rights groups, which all declined to comment on the case.\nThe Pentagon and the Justice Department declined requests for comment. Mr. Richter said the military has acknowledged receipt of the pardon request, though it remains unclear if any formal review has been initiated.\nThe normal process in this case would be for the Pentagon to send its recommendation to the Justice Department, whose decision would be sent to the White House for presidential review. The president has unilateral authority to issue a pardon at any time, however.\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\nMr. Trump has issued one pardon so far, to former Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona. The president didn\u2019t even wait for Mr. Arpaio\u2019s criminal contempt of court conviction to be finalized before offering clemency to his prominent political ally.\nThe president also has commuted a sentence for the former owner of a kosher slaughterhouse in Iowa who had been convicted of financial crimes.\nBehenna\u2019s request presents a different type of case, and history is hardly replete with military pardons.\nWhile it is not unheard of for a president to exercise his executive power under Article II, Clause 1 of the Constitution on a convicted service member\u2019s behalf, it is rare and most cases involved more high-profile incidents than Behenna\u2018s.\nAfter the Civil War, President Johnson extended a pardon to all former Confederates on Christmas Day 1868. Lt. William Calley, found guilty on 22 counts of premeditated murder for his role in the My Lai massacre in Vietnam, was pardoned by President Nixon.\nThe Washington Times Comment PolicyThe Washington Times is switching its third-party commenting system from Disqus to Spot.IM.

The Italian-American has spent nearly her whole life in politics, first as a 20-year member of the Democratic National Committee from California, then as the state party\u2019s chairman.She first won election to the House in 1987 \u2014 when Ronald Reagan was president \u2014 and she\u2019s been there ever since. In 2002, after working her way to the top, Mrs. Pelosi was elected speaker of the House, the first woman ever to helm a national party in the august chamber.It cannot be denied that Mrs. Pelosi has devoted her life to public service, and that (at least) is a noble cause.Now, the bad news. She\u2019s done \u2014 she\u2019s past done. Her ever-growing list of verbal blunders is far too long to catalog here, and the 77-year-old seems more and more out of touch with regular Americans (dubbing the recent tax cuts by President Trump \u2014 which amounts to thousands of dollars for many people \u2014 \u201ccrumbs\u201d is just the latest example).Worse, Mrs. Pelosi seems to keep coming up with new ways to embarrass herself.Like this week, for example. Mrs. Pelosi, like most Democrats, is freaked out by the House vote on Monday to release a four-page GOP memo alleging that the FBI and Justice Department illegally spied on the Trump campaign in 2016.That same day, she got into a heated argument with Chris Cuomo, an anchor at Dem-friendly CNN. When asked about the damning memo, she called the document a \u201ctotal misrepresentation\u201d and said it should be reviewed by intelligence officials before it is made public.At one point, Mr. Cuomo asked Mrs. Pelosi why FBI Director Christopher A. Wray has not objected to the release of the document if it\u2019s so awful. Mrs. Pelosi lost it. \u201cLet me just say this with all due respect: You really don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about right now,\u201d she spat at Mr. Cuomo, then proceeded to stammer and stutter through a list of weak reasons why the memo should not be released.That\u2019s been the strategy of top Democrats throughout: Argue that the memo, produced by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican, and his staff, is highly partisan and cannot be understood if viewed without the massive supporting documentation.Rep. Adam Schiff, California Democrat, last week said Congress cannot release the memo because the American public won\u2019t be able to understand it. \u201cWell, because the American people, unfortunately, don\u2019t have the underlying materials and therefore they can\u2019t see how distorted and misleading this document is,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cThe Republicans are not saying \u2018Make the underlying materials available to the public.\u2019 \u201cBut the memo likely will go public soon. In an effort to distract, Mrs. Pelosi said on CNN that its contents are all part of a \u201ccover-up.\u201d\u201cI think [House Speaker Paul D. Ryan] has a major responsibility and what I call a cover-up of what they are doing, it\u2019s really very sad,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi said in the CNN interview. \u201cBut again, it\u2019s a cover-up, it\u2019s a distraction. What really we are trying to do right now is keep government open. They have a problem with that because they are ineffective.\u201dAnd as she politicized the GOP effort to get to the bottom of the matter, she said, \u201cThis is not to be politicized.  It\u2019s not about making up a false memo.\u201dRepublicans, meanwhile, say the American people can make up their own minds. They argue that the memo details clear evidence of an anti-Trump bias both at the Justice Department and within special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into Russia\u2019s supposed interference in the 2016 election.Were the memo not so bad for Democrats \u2014 perhaps even good news \u2014 Mrs. Pelosi would no doubt be pushing for transparency and openness in government. Instead, she\u2019s insisting Americans are too dumb to understand the memo \u2014 which is all a lie and a cover-up, anyway.We\u2019d say that takes the cake, but Pelosi\u2019s bound to open her mouth again very soon, and who knows what embarrassing thing she\u2019s going to utter next.As Mrs. Pelosi said: \u201cIt\u2019s really very sad.\u201d\u2022 Joseph Curl has covered politics for 25 years, including 12 years as White House correspondent at The Washington Times.

None is identified.Funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party, these specific dossier charges of secret spy missions and criminality are what came to permeate the FBI investigation. Republicans say the FBI abused the court process by using the partisan charges to obtain four wiretap warrants against the other campaign. They say the bureau has yet to confirm any charge.As the dossier today takes on even more importance, The Washington Times identified Mr. Steele\u2019s 10 core collusion accusations. The analysis includes the charges\u2019 status, 20 months after Mr. Steele first contacted the FBI and urged the prosecution of President Trump.\u2981 The Trump campaign launched an \u201cextensive conspiracy\u201d with the Kremlin to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. To date, no public verification.\u2981 Mr. Trump, for decades a developer of tall buildings, maintained an eight-year relationship of give-and-take with Russian intelligence. To date, no public verification.\u2981 Mr. Trump and senior campaign aides actively supported the Russia hacking of Democratic Party computers to steal and release stolen emails. To date, no public verification.\u2981 Volunteer Carter Page and campaign manager Paul Manafort personally conspired with Moscow to hack the Democrats\u2019 computers. When the hacking began in 2015, neither man was associated with the Trump campaign. Both deny the charge. Mr. Page testified under oath that he had never met or spoken with Mr. Manafort. To date, no public verification of this dossier part.\u2981 Mr. Page, an Annapolis graduate, an energy investor and a former resident of Moscow, traveled to that city in early July 2016 to deliver a public speech at a university. The dossier says he met with two top Kremlin operatives and discussed bribes for working to lift economic sanctions. Mr. Page testified under oath that he had never met nor spoke with them. He has filed libel lawsuits.\u2981 Mr. Trump engaged with Russian prostitutes during a trip to Moscow in 2013. Mr. Trump has denied this numerous times. To date, no public verification.\u2981 Mr. Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, secretly traveled to Prague in August 2016. His supposed mission: to orchestrate payments with agents of Vladimir Putin to cover up the hacking. At that point, the hacking was known worldwide. Mr. Cohen repeatedly has denied under oath that he took such a trip and showed his passport. He has filed libel lawsuits, including against Fusion GPS. Fusion co-founder Glenn Simpson, who ordered the dossier, has suggested that Mr. Cohen took a private Russian plane and might have been on a yacht in the Adriatic Sea. To date, there has been no public verification of any of this.\u2981 Russian tech entrepreneur Aleksej Gubarev, owner of XBT Holding, hacked the Democrat Party computers with spyware and pornography. He has denied this repeatedly. He sued Mr. Steele for libel in a London court, where the former spy said the information was raw call-in information and not verified.\u2981 Three Russian oligarchs and shareholders in Alfa Bank were involved in Russian election interference and paid bribes to Mr. Putin. They deny the charges and have filed libel lawsuits.\u2981 Mikhail Kalugin was chief of the economic section at the Russian Embassy in Washington. Mr. Steele accuses him of being a spy and of funding the hacking with skimmed-off pension funds. He was supposedly whisked out of Washington when the hacking scandal broke in August. Washington associates of Mr. Kalugin told The Washington Times that the diplomat announced his planned departure 10 months beforehand. He and his family returned to Moscow. He now works in the Foreign Ministry. A former senior U.S. government official told The Times that Mr. Kalugin was never internally identified as a spy.Republicans and dossier targets uniformly deride the 35 pages as falsehoods and fabrications. Some Democrats have acknowledged that the collection of memos is flawed.But there are steadfast dossier believers, such liberal Twitter brigades and Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the leading Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.The FBI used the unverified dossier on Oct. 21, 2016, to obtain a court wiretap warrant on Mr. Page that lasted nearly a year.Agents included dossier information in the application and three subsequent renewals. The filing was based on the pledge from Mr. Steele that he was not the source of a dossier-type report on Mr. Page that Michael Isikoff reported in Yahoo News in September 2016. But in the London court case, Mr. Steele acknowledged that he was the source.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, released a declassified referral last week that urges the Justice Department to open a criminal investigation of Mr. Steele for lying to the FBI.Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, issued a rebuttal on Friday.\u201cNot a single revelation in the Steele dossier has been refuted,\u201d she said, referring to the former MI-6 officer as a \u201crespected and reliable expert on Russia.\u201dShe said the Grassley-Graham referral \u201cprovides no evidence that Steele was ever asked about the Isikoff article or if asked that he lied.\u201dBut the Republican senator\u2019s referral said there is ample evidence that Mr. Steele lied.\u201cThere is substantial evidence suggesting that Mr. Steele materially misled the FBI about a key aspect of his dossier efforts, one which bears on his credibility,\u201d the referral said.The next paragraph, which presumedly details that evidence, is completely redacted.The two senators wrote, \u201cThe FBI already believed Mr. Steele was reliable, he had previously told the FBI he had not shared the information with the press \u2014 and lying to the FBI is a crime.\u201dFour targets of the dossier have filed seven libel lawsuits against Mr. Steele, Fusion GPS and BuzzFeed, which first posted it online on Jan. 10, 2017, during Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential transition.Then FBI-Director James B. Comey told Mr. Trump in a one-on-one meeting that month that the dossier was \u201csalacious and unverified.\u201dAt the same time, the FBI was citing dossier information before a judge to obtain a second 90-day wiretap warrant on Mr. Page.

John McCain is rejoining the immigration debate, backing a new bill that would grant illegal immigrant \u201cDreamers\u201d a very generous pathway to citizenship in exchange for promises of future border security \u2014 but no wall.Mr. McCain is joining Sen. Chris Coons, Delaware Democrat, in sponsoring the Senate companion to a bipartisan proposal in the House worked out between Reps. Will Hurd, Texas Republican, and Pete Aguilar, California Democrat.The House bill has gained significant bipartisan support but violates the conditions President Trump has set for his signature on a bill, so it\u2019s unclear what its prospects are.Still, Mr. McCain \u2014 who has been absent from Congress this year for health reasons \u2014 said he\u2019s confident he\u2019s cut a middle ground.\u201cOur legislation, which already has broad support in the House of Representatives, would address the most urgent priorities of protecting Dreamers, strengthening border security, alleviating the backlog in immigration courts, and addressing the root causes of illegal immigration,\u201d he said.The Hurd-Aguilar bill would grant a pathway to citizenship to potentially more than 3.2 million illegal immigrants, allowing anyone who came before age 18 and before 2014 to apply for legal status.The bill does nothing to limit the chain of family migration nor does it end the Diversity Visa Lottery, as Mr. Trump has called for.Instead it would pump money into the struggling counties of Central America, hoping the cash will convince governments to improve conditions and try to do more to keep their citizens at home.The bill also adds immigration judges to the system, which could help speed deportation cases.But the crux of the bill\u2019s border security is a call for a study \u2014 the latest in a series of such studies \u2014 to determine what\u2019s needed. Homeland Security would then be given until 2021 to follow through.Mr. McCain has long pushed for a legalization of illegal immigrants, having been involved in Senate fights in 2006, 2007 and 2013. The 2006 and 2013 bills both passed the Senate but failed to gain traction in the House, where Republicans said it was too heavy on \u201camnesty\u201d and too light on serious security measures.Most House Republicans have signaled they remain opposed to Mr. McCain\u2019s latest approach.\n                 LOAD COMMENTS ()\n              HIDE COMMENTS", "link": null, "source": "The Washington Times", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kathleen Ronayne", "body": "SAN DIEGO \u2014 U.S. Sen.

Turning to his daughter, he said, \u201cIvanka, you\u2019ve got to do something!\u201d\nOne of Mr. Kushner\u2019s top aides, Josh Raffel, also announced his regination last week. And White House staff secretary Rob Porter resigned last month, part of a staff turnover of more than 33 percent in the West Wing in a little more than a year.\n\u201cSo many people have been leaving the White House,\u201d Mr. Trump said tongue-in-cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s actually been really exciting and invigorating. I like turnover. I like chaos. It really is good.\u201d\nReferring to reports that Chief of Staff John F. Kelly has been limiting the access of Mr. Kushner and Ivanka Trump to the Oval Office, Mr. Trump deadpanned, \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of criticism of John Kelly in the press, which I think is very very unfair. He\u2019s doing an amazing job. He even told me he would let Ivanka visit the Oval Office when she gets home from representing us in the Olympics and she did so.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cNow the question everyone keeps asking is, \u2018Who\u2019s going to be the next to leave? [Adviser] Steve Miller or Melania?\u2019 \u2026 That is terrible honey, but you love me, right?\u201d\n\u201cThe White House is actually a warm, loving, and wonderful place,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it\u2019s cold.

And I just don\u2019t understand why everyone on the internet and in the media keeps screaming, \u2018Hashtag Free Melania.\u2019 She\u2019s actually having a great time.\u201d\nThe president also referred to the continual friction between himself and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who angered Mr. Trump at the start of his presidency by recusing himself from any Russia investigations.\n\u201cAttorney General Sessions is here with us tonight. I offered him a ride over and he recused himself,\u201d the president said.\nHe said Vice President Mike Pence \u201cstarts out each morning asking everybody, \u2018Has he been impeached yet?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be impeached when there\u2019s no crime!\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cMike, put that down!\u201d\nTurning to the media, Mr. Trump said CNN \u201clost a tremendous amount of credibility this year, but they also lost one of their true stars, the guy who got you the most scoops \u2026 your really very best reporter.

That guy leaked more than the Titanic.\u201d\nReferring to former White House aide Omarosa Manigault, who was forced out last year and has threatened to write a tell-all book about her experience, Mr. Trump said, \u201cSomehow, we\u2019re still doing great even without Omarosa. By the way, I always knew, someday, you\u2019re going to fire her. Is that the worst? By the way, Omarosa, you\u2019re the worst!\u201d\nShe was a star on Mr. Trump\u2019s hit TV show, \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d\nMr. Trump jokingly compared his TV show to his presidency.\n\u201cMany people have asked me how my time as a reality TV star prepared me for the presidency, the truth is there\u2019s very little overlap between the two,\u201d he said. \u201cIn one job, I had to manage a cutthroat cast of characters desperate for TV time, totally unprepared for their \u2026 jobs, and each week afraid of having their asses fired. In the other job, I was the host of a smash television hit. Television\u2019s so easy compared to this.\u201d\nThe president spared almost no Democrats in his speech.\nOn Rep. Adam Schiff of California, a House Intelligence Committee member accused by the White House of frequent leaks to the media: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what committee he\u2019s on because he\u2019s on the phone so much. He was going to come tonight and then he heard that this was not a televised event so he stayed home.\u201d\nOn House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi: \u201cShe\u2019s crazy, but she\u2019s a fine woman.\u201d\nOn former Vice President Joe Biden, who is said to be considering a run for president in 2020: \u201cThere\u2019s talk about Joe Biden, Sleepy Joe, getting into the race. Just trust me, I would kick his ass. But Joe \u2014 give me a break. The guy who keeps making outrageous statements thinks he has a shot at being president? Guy makes outrageous statements. He\u2019s going to be president? He doesn\u2019t have a shot.\u201d\nWith many media members in the room, Mr. Trump concluded by extending an olive branch of sorts to the press, after a year in which he has clashed with them repeatedly.\n\u201cI do want to say this is one of the best times I can ever remember having with the media. This might be the most fun I\u2019ve had since watching your faces on election night,\u201d he said. \u201cI do have a lot of respect for a lot of the people in this room. Even people that have been very strong opponents, I\u2019ve developed a lot of respect. Fairness is important to me, but you know, you\u2019ve got your point of view.
