[{"author": "By Asawin.suebsaeng@thedailybeast.com (asawin Suebsaeng) Lachlan Markay", "body": "Reporters gathered at the White House on Friday were stunned when Chief of Staff John Kelly shared a very embarrassing story about outgoing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.\nThe reporters were there with senior White House officials for an off-the-record meeting with Kelly, who was attempting to tamp down speculation about an impending administration staff purge. The Daily Beast was not invited, but was briefed on its contents by three sources with knowledge of the meeting.\nAccording to those sources, Kelly recounted a very awkward conversation with Tillerson during which he informed the secretary that President Donald Trump would very likely soon fire him. The awkwardness was less a result of the contents of the conversation than its setting.\nTillerson, Kelly told the room, was suffering from a stomach bug during a diplomatic swing through Africa, and was using a toilet when Kelly broke the news to him.\nSources were stunned that, even in an off-record setting, Kelly would say this\u2014to a room filled with White House officials and political reporters\u2014about Tillerson, who does not officially leave the State Department until the end of the month.\nKelly is routinely touted as one of the more mature members of Trump\u2019s top brass and has often been branded as one of the \u201cadults\u201d in charge.\nThe comment was especially bizarre given Kelly\u2019s reported past cover for Tillerson. The chief of staff tried for months to keep the secretary of state in his post, The New York Times reported, and fumed at his dismissal. \nA State Department spokesperson said he was not familiar with the phone call and therefore could not comment.\nA White House spokesman declined to comment when reached by The Daily Beast about the scatalogical comment from the White House chief of staff that further contributed to what has been a particularly inglorious end for Tillerson, days after he was sacked via tweet, without warning from the president.\nIt wasn't Kelly's only off color comment at the meeting. According to an Axios report, he also joked about incoming chief economic advisor Larry Kudlow\u2019s former cocaine habit. Kudlow, who has been up front about his past drug problems, has been sober for 23 years. Axios also reported that Kelly said in the meeting that Trump himself was likely contributing to rumors and stories regarding chaos at the cabinet and senior staff level.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/john-kelly-rex-tillerson-was-on-the-toilet-when-i-told-him-hed-be-getting-fired?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Mark Leon", "body": "I first started covering John Bolton in 2005. At the time, the United Nations was gearing up for its largest-ever meeting of heads of state to mark the organization\u2019s 60th anniversary. The fete was to take place the annual United Nations General Assembly that September, the focal point of which was a major package of reforms that had been painstakingly negotiated by countries prior to the September summit.\nBut weeks before presidents and prime ministers were to arrive to celebrate the successful signing of these reforms, John Bolton entered the picture. Bolton was granted a recess appointment by George W. Bush on August 5, just as negotiations entered their final stages.\nThe talks were \u00a0immediately thrown into disarray.\nBolton inserted hundreds of objections to a late draft of the agreement, creating new \u201cred lines\u201d for the United States where none had previously existed. His objections covered issues big and small -- even on semantics. For example, he rejected the mere mention of a poverty-alleviation program called the \u201cMillennium Development Goals.\u201d He refused to budge from his maximalist position on this and every other edit he made to the document.\nAt the time, he seemed to relish in the chaos that he had sewn. During late night press encounters he would quip \u201cAll night, all right!\u201d, as if his goal was less to negotiate in good faith and more to just drag out the negotiations as a deadline loomed.\nEventually, as I reported at the time, then-Secretary General Kofi Annan got so fed up with Bolton\u2019s antics that he called then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and asked her to reign him in. She did. The reform packages passed at the eleventh hour. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIn his memoir, he reserves his harshest criticism and deepest vitriol not for the representatives from Iran or Venezuela, but for his British counterpart, UK Ambassador Emyr Jones Parry, whom he mercilessly pillories as an \u201cEU Roid.\u201d\u201d\n\nThat incident presaged Bolton\u2019s entire tenure at the UN. The memoir he wrote of his experience at the UN was titled \u201cSurrender is Not an Option.\u201d But Bolton\u2019s time at the UN suggests that, to him, the natural give and take of diplomacy is akin to \u201csurrender\u201d and must be avoided at all costs. Understanding how he performed his job at the UN gives us big clues as to how he might approach the job as National Security Advisor to which he has just been named. \nAt the United Nations, Bolton demonstrated a profoundly zero-sum view of international relations. Other countries\u2019 gains -- no matter how insignificant -- \u00a0were ipso-facto America\u2019s losses. This upended traditional alliances at the UN. Typically the United States and its European allies would band together in negotiations that reflected common interests. But Bolton was never willing to give an inch and accept the kinds of trade-offs proposed by American allies. In his memoir, he reserves his harshest criticism and deepest vitriol not for the representatives from Iran or Venezuela, but for his British counterpart, UK Ambassador Emyr Jones Parry, whom he mercilessly pillories as an \u201cEU Roid.\u201d\nThe same dynamic also existed in his interagency battles. He steadfastly opposed a joint European-American initiative to negotiate with Iran, only to be overruled, again, by Condi \u00a0Rice. Bolton also pushed back against efforts by the Bureau of East Asia and Pacific Affairs at State Department (known as the \u201cEAP\u201d bureau) to re-open negotiations with North Korea through a format called the Six Party Talks. In his memoir, Bolton derides American diplomats at the bureau as \u201cEAPeasers.\u201d\nEven before he became Ambassador to the UN, Bolton demonstrated a propensity to fixate on relatively minor foreign policy issues and elevate them to major crisis points. In 2003, Bolton served as the Under Secretary of Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security. As he recounts in his memoir, he relished the opportunity to knee-cap the nascent International Criminal Court, which was set up to prosecute individuals for genocide and mass atrocity. \u00a0\nPresident Bill Clinton, in his final days in office, signed the treaty that created this court. In Bolton\u2019s early days as Undersecretary of State he declared that the United States had \u201cunsigned\u201d the treaty. He remarked that this was his happiest moment of his life as a public servant. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nBut that was not enough. Bolton then embarked on an international campaign to secure bilateral agreements with as many countries as possible to theoretically grant Americans immunity from prosecution by the ICC. He would threaten these countries with a cut-off of military assistance should they not sign onto the agreement.\nOne can argue about the propriety of the International Criminal Court. But his fixation on these immunity agreements created awkward and unnecessary friction with American allies. In 2003, for example, Latvia saw its military aid cut even as it was one of the very few countries in Europe to contribute its troops to George W. Bush's war in Iraq. Latvia was a member of the coalition of the willing, but it was not willing to sign one of these agreements with the United States and so saw some military aid suspended even as its troops were in Iraq.\nWhat does Bolton\u2019s past suggest about how he will approach the job of National Security Advisor?\nGenerally speaking, there are two kinds of National Security Advisors. There are those who emphasize their role as an honest broker between competing viewpoints and bureaucracies to judiciously oversee what is known as the \u201cinteragency process.\u201d And there are those who are infighters themselves, who advocate for specific viewpoints and policies.\nI think we can safely guess what role John Bolton will fill. And that is the real danger. Bolton has famously called for pre-emptive war with both North Korea and Iran. He\u2019s demonstrated a callous propensity to alienate allies. He enters into negotiations unwilling to give an inch.\nSo this is the man who, as of April 9, will be whispering in Donald Trump\u2019s ear and running National Security Council meetings. You\u2019ve read about his extreme positions vis a vis North Korea and Iran. And now you\u2019ve read that he enjoys alienating allies and thinks diplomacy is appeasement.

Listing contacts, personal, financial and travel information in enormous, painstaking detail isn't trivial, and even small errors will get the form kicked back to you or your clearance rejected. Applicants are required to spell out in great detail the specifics of foreign travel and overseas contacts. Investigators need to know where you\u2019ve made your money and to whom you have debts.\nI did it in my early 20s when my life was relatively uncomplicated, and it was still a pain in the ass. It's not easy, and it's not supposed to be.\nIt\u2019s even harder when you\u2019re a corrupt, entitled snake who repeatedly lies about your finances to federal investigators and serves as a living, breathing poster child for privileged venality. It\u2019s even harder when you've rather clumsily attempted to use both your familial relationship and proximity to the President of the United States to save your family\u2019s failing real estate empire.\nAll of which helps explain Jared Kushner\u2019s very bad day on Tuesday. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, a man who has compromised himself and his supposed values to accommodate and indulge President Trumphausen\u2019s various whims, impulses, urges, feuds, and paranoid episodes finally drew the line and busted Kushner\u2019s security clearance down from TS/SCI to Wal Mart Greeter Background Check (Provisional).\nHear that? That was America's intelligence community down to the last GS-7 breathing a loud sigh of relief.\nKushner is a man who needs a billion dollars fast, and is willing to cast shame on the winds to get there. The stench of his venality and desperation hangs around him like stripper perfume, cloying and obvious. Jared all but hiked up his sassy pink petticoats while whistling, \u201cHey, sailor!\u201d to the Chinese, Israeli, Arab, and Russian investors he begged to invest in his failing 666 5th Avenue white elephant.\nKushner has no one to blame but himself. His ambition exceeded his abilities by orders of magnitude so vast it would take a team of advanced mathematicians a generation to devise a system by which to measure the differential. Even his simpering beta-male, child-voiced affect couldn\u2019t hide his spectacular reach and overpowering thirst for the power, influence, and financial rewards of Washington.\nIt wasn't just that Kushner omitted tens of millions of dollars of investments from his SF-86 and was forced to revise again and again and again, or that his listing of foreign contacts and engagements was glaringly insufficient. It's that he lied and omitted information in a way that was painfully obvious to the FBI and government officials examining his qualifications for the most elevated intelligence clearances. Then, the whispers in foreign capitals started; Kushner, they whispered, is for sale. American intelligence was listening.\nTuesday night, the Washington Post broke a massive story on intercepted intelligence from the UAE, China, Israel, and Mexico in which foreign officials capered in glee over how to manipulate and bribe the Naif Prince of Trumplandia. It\u2019s one thing to be a target. It\u2019s another thing to be an easy target.\nThe knowledge that every foreign intelligence agency in the world saw Kushner\u2019s desperation for cash no doubt set America\u2019s beleaguered counterintelligence community into a state of raw panic. The fact that Kushner is up to his hot-yogaed ass in dealings with Sergei Kislyak and was a key member of the infamous Trump Tower meeting in which Russia offered a quid for a still mysterious quo is just the icing on that cake.\nUntil today, Jared Kushner was one of a handful of recipients of the President\u2019s Daily Brief, a product that compiles the crown jewels of the American intelligence community\u2019s input and analysis. He was exposed to source and methods, high-grade analytical product, and the darkest secrets we have gleaned from the most sensitive sources. Although President Postliterate Bestwords has his PDB presented in graphic novel form or performed by costumed dancers, Jared was apparently an aggressive consumer of intelligence, ordering up briefings and information outside even his broad purview. What he knows after a year in this position makes him the juiciest intelligence target in the world.\nTrump\u2019s nepotism always put the soft-handed Kushner on an impossible pedestal. By the time it was clear even to a slowcoach like Trump that Jared couldn\u2019t be the Minister of All Portfolios, it was too late. The imagined power couple of Jared and Ivanka waged their snippy, passive-aggressive media war from their offices in the West Wing, leaking diligently to boot first Reince Priebus, and then Steve Bannon from the White House. The humiliation of being ousted by Jarvanka must rankle Bannon to this day. Kelly was their next target, but he moved first, and struck hard.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Trump can either give in to the simpering \u201cBut Daaaaaaaady\u201d whinge of Princess Ivanka and restore Jared to his full suite of security clearances, or face a tornado of razor cuts from leaks over Jared\u2019s business dealings and behavior. \nThe almost certain knowledge that Robert Mueller isn\u2019t done with Jared by a long stretch doesn\u2019t make it any easier for Trump, even as the red flags thrown up by Rod Rosenstein over the president\u2019s son-in-law and very special adviser were one more sign of the urgency of closing up the leakiest, riskiest White House in history. The best part of this trap is that Trump (R-Oppositional Defiant Disorder) will be tempted to do the one thing that will make his political situation more politically tenuous and legally risky by restoring Jared\u2019s clearances. It\u2019s within his rights as the President, but he would be dumber than a sack of hammers to do so. A smart President would have already told Jared to pack up and get the hell out, but...oh, who are we kidding?\nThis battle was only ever going to end one way, and in the war of the Deep State vs. Team Trump, the bad guys often make it easy by being greedy, sloppy, and stupid.

That is the suit in which Zervos charges \u00a0Trump defamed her by calling her a liar. She was one of more than a dozen women who accused him of groping and or kissing them.\nTrump had sought through his lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, to block the suit, arguing in December that a sitting president cannot be sued in state court. Kasowitz further argued that Trump was too busy leading the free world, and that Trump\u2019s remarks were \u201cpolitical speech\u201d covered by the First Amendment.\nIn an uncommonly clear 18-page ruling three months in careful making, Judge Jennifer Schechter rejected all that. She offered a simple principle that is a pillar of America\u2019s true greatness.\n\u201cNo one is above the law,\u201d Schechter wrote.\nShe cited Clinton v.

That puts the Zervos case in a whole other league than the Stormy Daniels scandal, which involves only consensual sex with a woman who took money not to talk and now wants to talk. \nAnd Zervos cannot be bought off.

Trump, Schechter found further legal grounds for Zervos\u2019 particular suit by citing a New York State Court of Appeals case which held that a college basketball coach was liable for branding two players money-hungry liars for accusing one of his staff of molesting them. \n\u201cIn Davis v Boeheim, the Court of Appeals determined that a defamation action could be maintained against a defendant who called individuals claiming to have been victims of sexual abuse liars and stated that he believed that they were motivated by money to go public,\u201d Schechter wrote.\nIn that case, the plaintiffs did not have to prove they had been molested to establish that they had been defamed. They needed only to show they had not come forward simply seeking personal gain as the coach alleged.\nSchechter cites in her decision Trump\u2019s repeated accusations that Zervos and the other women had come forward either seeking fame or at the instigation of the Hillary Clinton campaign.\nAs the decision notes, Trump tweeted that the allegations were \u201ctotally made up nonsense to steal the election.\u201d\nThe decision further quotes Trump at an October, 2016 rally in Pennsylvania:\n\"Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign, total fabrication. The events never happened. Never. All these liars will be sued after the election is over.\u201d\nTrump is now the one being sued and the judge notes that Zervos need not prove that he groped her in the hotel room.

Its chairman Devin Nunes and the committee itself are both hopelessly compromised. Nunes has done everything in his power to cover for the President, his staff, and their Russian contacts, and to elide Vladimir Putin\u2019s stated intent and obvious actions.\nWhen secret agent man Devin Nunes raced to the White House to break a phony story of illegal and inappropriate surveillance from a mysterious \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d it turned out the super-secret intel he set his ass on fire to reveal came from\u2026\u00a0wait for it\u2026\u00a0the White House itself. \u00a0Ezra Cohen-Watnick and Michael Ellis, both employees of the White House, provided Nunes with top secret material outside the approved channels to push one of many of the White House\u2019s endless variations on the \u201cno collusion\u2014no puppet, you\u2019re the puppet\u201d defense. \nNunes released a memo last month that tried and failed to bring the grown-ups\u2019 investigations to a halt, and to change the facts of why Carter Page and Trump campaign officials came under the baleful glare of the FISA Court. Spoiler: it wasn\u2019t the intelligence community helping Hillary Clinton. It was Trump\u2019s allies and family ass-deep in contacts, connections, communications, and coordination with Vladimir Putin\u2019s information warfare operation. \u00a0\nTo imagine for even one moment that every intelligence agency in this nation is wrong and that Devin Nunes, super-staffer Derek Harvey and the other partisans are right about Putin and Trump is beyond ludicrous. Harvey, a refugee from the Trump national security council purge executed by H.R. McMaster and John Kelly, is now the lead agent in the coverup by Republican members of the House.

The committee refused to interview key players in the drama, failed to seek campaign, government, intelligence community and corporate records that would have led to places that Team Trump doesn\u2019t want them to go. \u00a0\nIn fact, this White House has refused to even recognize Putin\u2019s global special warfare operations against us exist, much less to take a stand against them. Trump continues to behave toward Putin like a preacher caught in a whorehouse; cowed, compliant, and terrified of his prospective blackmailer. Putin\u2019s ongoing attempts to divide and influence the American political system aren\u2019t speculation, imagination, or some Soros-driven conspiracy. His anti-American propaganda campaign is still in full swing, and the only upside is he\u2019s not murdering people here quite yet, though if I were Paul Manafort I\u2019d cut the deal and get into witness protection now.\nThat Members of Congress who have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and protect this nation have engaged in a sham investigation about to produce a sham report to protect a sham President is an insult to the oath they swore and itself a clear and present danger to the security of our nation.

Nunberg seemed not to care about how the chips would fall. But several of his friends told The Daily Beast they were concerned that he was putting himself in severe legally jeopardy by going on multiple live cable-news programs Monday afternoon. \nThey also said that they were worried Nunberg had been drinking prior to dialing in to MSNBC and CNN. \nStarting Monday morning, Nunberg began calling several close associates that he was flatly refusing, at this time, to cooperate with Mueller\u2019s investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Three Nunberg friends said they walked away from those conversations fearful that he was \u201cdrinking again\u201d and was about to embark on a personal tailspin. They didn\u2019t know it would play out on daytime TV. \nNunberg did not respond to multiple calls and texts from The Daily Beast\nOne associate urged Nunberg, a witness in Mueller\u2019s probe, not to do anything stupid and to go to his parents\u2019 house immediately. According to this source, Nunberg promptly hung up. Minutes later, the former Trump campaign aide was on MSNBC via phone, starting a mid-Monday media blitz that would include several different shows on CNN and MSNBC.\n\"I think it would be funny if they arrested me,\u201d Nunberg told MSNBC\u2019s Katy Tur on Monday during a freewheeling interview that ended with the former Trump aide asking, \u201cWhat do you think Mueller is gonna do to me?\u201d\nNunberg\u2019s cable news escapades came shortly after The Washington Post published an interview with Nunberg, in which he said he plans to defy a subpoena from the special counsel, who\u2019s seeking his testimony as part of the investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election. \nNunberg remains defiant, and insistent that the investigations into possible Trump campaign \u201ccollusion\u201d with sketchy Russian actors were part of a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d But Nunberg suggested on MSNBC that Mueller might nonetheless be in possession of some sort of incriminating evidence.\n\u201cDo you think that they have something on the president?\" Tur asked him. \n\u201cI think they may,\u201d Nunberg replied. \u201cI think that he may have done something during the election.\"\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

He repeatedly raged about President Trump treating him \u201cvery badly\u201d and \u201clike crap.\u201d \n\u201cDonald Trump is an idiot,\u201d he declared at one point. \nNunberg vented about having to hire a lawyer for 80 hours to help sort through campaign emails and having to pay \u201c50-grand [in] legal fees.\u201d He also talked on-air about how his lawyer was probably going to ditch him now. \nThe conversation wasn\u2019t always focused on Mueller. Nunberg, at one point, riffed on \u201cBill Clinton\u2019s illegitimate black child\u201d and the \u201caffair\u201d between Trump-world figures Hope Hicks and Corey Lewandowski. And he stuck up for his friends and fellow former Trump campaign alums Roger Stone and Steve Bannon. (Nunberg says Mueller\u2019s team is asking for him to fork over his communications with Stone and Bannon, among others.)\nWhen White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked about the ongoing meltdown at the press briefing on Monday, she said that Nunberg was \u201cincorrect\u201d in his assertions, and reminded the press that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t work at the White House.\u201d\nOther West Wing officials were similarly unimpressed.\n\u201cWhat the fuck is this guy doing,\u201d one senior Trump aide asked The Daily Beast, mid-Nunberg-rant. Another source said they saw another White House official \u201cfacepalm\u201d as they reacted to a Nunberg interview in real-time this afternoon.\nStone, Nunberg\u2019s mentor, was measured in response to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s wild media appearances.\n\u201cI was briefly part of the Trump campaign and has [sic] been the President's friend and adviser for decades; and would expect that Mueller's team would at some point ask for any documents or emails sent or written by me,\u201d Stone messaged The Daily Beast in response to inquiries related to the Nunberg cable-news blitz. \u201cBut let me reiterate, I have no knowledge or involvement in Russian Collusion or any other inappropriate act.\u201d\nNunberg\u2019s behavior this week is unlikely to improve or repair his standing in Trump-world, which was never that great even before the president essentially exiled him early on in the presidential campaign. According to two sources with direct knowledge, when Nunberg worked for Trump as a political adviser, the future president would regularly berate Nunberg in private. Trump would call him a \u201cjackass\u201d and a \u201cshithead,\u201d among other derogatory terms, and make fun of him, and swear at him loudly.\nTrump has twice fired Nunberg, and subsequently sued him for ten million dollars. \n\u201cSam Nunberg was fired. He\u2019s a highly self-destructive individual who makes routine calls begging for his job back,\u201d Trump told The Daily Beast in December 2015, in response to Nunberg\u2019s comments predicting that Trump was doomed in the Republican primary. \u201cThis is the interview of a desperate person who is trying to hang on and stay relevant.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "John Avlon", "body": "At a time when insane is the new normal, our ability to be outraged is dulled amid daily incoming. But Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee\u2014led by their chairman, Trump lackey Devin Nunes\u2014somehow hit a new low with Thursday\u2019s revelation that they leaked to Fox News texts from Senate Intelligence Committee Co-Chairman Mark Warner and a Russian businessman in a desperate attempt to discredit the Senator. Those texts \u00a0were then retweeted by our president, in a brushback pitch for Warner's insistence on investigating Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election\u2014and potential collusion with the Trump campaign\u2014without fear or favor. \nThis bombshell story, first reported by the New York Times, is not your garden variety Trump-related drama. It\u2019s worse. At a time when institutional checks and balances are needed more than ever, it underscored just how bad the blood is on Capitol Hill\u2014not just between the two parties, but between the House and the Senate itself. \nDevin Nunes\u2014a California dairy farmer who degraded himself by becoming a Congressman\u2014deserves disproportionate blame for this pathetic mess. His committee has turned the pursuit of truth into a partisan mockery, choosing to do the White House's bidding at the expense of honest inquiry and fact-based debate. \nThis is a stunning violation of whatever is left of congressional norms, but it also establishes the collusive relationship between hyper-partisans on the Hill and hyper-partisan media, particularly the opinion side of Fox News (there are some good reporters at Fox, including Shepard Smith, Bret Baier and Chris Wallace, who don\u2019t deserve to get dragged into this swamp). This sharing of private information was apparently designed not just to influence domestic debate and inflame internal divisions but also to supply talking points to the President, who \u00a0dutifully retweeted the information as if it was impartial evidence. \nIn fact, as Republican senators, including Marco Rubio, immediately pointed out, the spoon-fed Fox \u201cscoop\u201d was simply dishonest deflection and distraction. \u00a0But that has become the calling card of the Trump administration and its apologists. \nThis cold congressional civil war is another departure from normal, let alone our best traditions. The Senate Committee run by Warner and Burr has been, however fitfully, working towards fulfilling its bipartisan obligation to find the facts on Russia and put the national security of the United States ahead of partisan interests; they remember Republican Senator Arthur Vandenberg\u2019s belief that \u201cpartisan politics ought to end at the water\u2019s edge.\u201d \nIn contrast, Devin Nunes keeps getting caught playing a flailing game of footsie with the Trump White House, which led to his being sidelined by ethics investigations last year (Nunes was subsequently cleared). He still seems determined to muddy the national debate on President Trump\u2019s behalf. \nWith this latest internecine insult, Nunes has lost whatever remaining shred of credibility he could claim qualified him to lead the House Intelligence Committee. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s now on Speaker Paul Ryan to assert his principled independence by replacing Nunes as Chairman. In some ways, it\u2019s a shame because Nunes had a decent reputation before assuming chairmanship of the House Intelligence Committee. \u00a0But this position seems to have made him more of a hack instead of elevating his game. \nThe once and future dairy farmer should know when he\u2019s shoveling manure.

He was the beneficiary of the highly questionable Russian contacts his campaign made and desperately tried to keep secret leading up to the 2016 election, which speaks of collusion and much worse. Trump couldn\u2019t have chosen two top advisers with more contacts with the Kremlin than campaign manager Manafort and national security adviser Michael Flynn. He could hardly have praised Russia President Valdimir Putin more. And he could have hardly benefitted more from Russian interference than to win. \nOf course, there\u2019s no law against Trump liking Putin; unseemly yes, illegal, no. But a veteran Washington former federal prosecutor who served during both the Clinton and Bush administrations believes there is a strategy that Mueller is quietly pursuing and that explains his actions so far. \nSeth Waxman, now a partner specializing in white-collar crime in Dickinson Wright\u2019s Washington office, has a theory of Mueller\u2019s case, which requires no novel reading of existing law to find Trump broke it. It employs the main weapon any federal prosecutor uses to police public corruption. It is Title 18 United States Code, section 201 that specifically makes it a crime for a public official to take \u201canything of value,\u201d a bribe, in exchange for government action, which can be prospective. \nNote that above I wrote \u201cpublic official.\u201d That\u2019s because the law is generally wielded against public officials. Problem: Mueller is investigating conduct before Trump became one. Enter Waxman. He points out that in 1962, Congress extended the bribery law to cover activity prior to the assumption of office. It did so, he says, in order to close a \u201cloophole\u201d afforded those \u201cwho assume public office under a corrupt commitment.\u201d The upshot? Trump became covered by 18 USC not when he was sworn in but as of July 21, 2016 when he became his party\u2019s nominee in Cleveland, Ohio. \nWhat we know of Mueller\u2019s strategy so far is consistent with leveling charges under the bribery statute. This is not to say Mueller is going to indict Trump. He would need an exception from a Justice Department rule, which advises against it. But neither is he likely to send a report laying out grounds for impeachment as former independent counsel Ken Starr did against Bill Clinton relying solely on perjury and obstruction of justice without a finding of an underlying crime. \n\n\u201cThe upshot? Trump became covered by 18 USC not when he was sworn in but as of July 21, 2016 when he became his party\u2019s nominee in Cleveland, Ohio.\u201d\n\nThe bribery statute requires a finding of a quid pro quo, a this for a that. The quid is obviously Russian meddling in our election\u2014a given to everyone but Trump himself\u2014which worked to his everlasting benefit. Thus Mueller\u2019s focus on the summer 2016 meeting at Trump Tower, the one Trump\u2019s senior team of Donald Jr., Jared Kushner, and Manafort had with Natalia Veselnitskaya, a prominent Kremlin lawyer. \u00a0This was the meeting former chief White House strategist Steve Bannon called \u201ctreasonous.\u201d When it became public, Trump was so concerned he got uncharacteristically involved in the details of defending it, drafting a statement, which said the meeting was simply about \u201cadoptions.\u201d \nIt wasn\u2019t at all. It was an offer of \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton which Don Jr. eagerly accepted, responding, \u201cI love it.\u201d The mere contact, Bannon said, should have prompted an immediate call to the FBI. But Trump was too soft on Putin to see the Russian contacts for what they were and thought he could hide behind the adoption excuse. In any event, Trump welcomed Russian involvement (\u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing\u201d) not to mention Trump\u2019s hope that WikiLeaks would turn its attention to Democrats. He wasn\u2019t joking.\nTrump never got Hillary Clinton\u2019s personal emails but he got a systematic and sophisticated effort to undermine his opponent on social media, the reach of which we only dimly understand, and, according to U.S. intelligence, a successful hacking by Russian military intelligence (the GRU) of the servers of the Democratic National Committee and the email of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, which were handed over to Wikileaks to be published. Podesta\u2019s email set off the rumor a few days before the election that Podesta and Clinton were part of a satanic cult enslaving children in the basement of a Washington pizza parlor. \u00a0\u00a0\nProving the quo specifically is hard but for a bribery to succeed, the act of returning the favor does not have to be completed, especially in the case of a candidate who can\u2019t deliver until later. Trump repeatedly signaled his willingness to warm up the country\u2019s cold war with Putin. When it was pointed out that he was praising an enemy of the United States who kills his political opponents, Trump retorted that we kill people in this country too. \u00a0Trump had his own web of connections to Moscow, from the Miss Universe pageant to business enterprises that Manafort and Flynn were only too happy to enlarge. Kushner hoped to open a backchannel to Moscow once he was in charge of world peace. Manafort already had strong ties to various oligarchs and a line into Putin (a version of which Kushner wanted to establish once in the White House) and slipped in a Russia-friendly clause on Ukraine into the GOP platform. \nIt could be a coincidence, but Veselnitskaya, the Kremlin lawyer who was at the Trump Tower meeting, had long been fighting a money laundering case in New York and suddenly won a favorable settlement after Trump\u2019s election. Most significantly the lawyer wanted relief from the Magnitsky Act, which imposes harsh monetary sanctions on senior Russian officials, a wish being fulfilled by inaction on Trump\u2019s part. During the transition, Flynn was overheard on an intercept advising a Russia official to just hold tight and not overreact to Obama\u2019s sanctions because help in the form of a Trump presidency was on the way. And it has been. Congress overwhelmingly voted to impose new sanctions on Russia. But Trump has yet to bring any. \nEven as more and more in his party concluded Russia meddled, Trump preferred to call the investigation a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and cite Putin\u2019s \u201cfeelings\u201d that there had been no such interference well into his presidency. While Trump has no problem insulting allies like Britain\u2019s Teresa May and Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, he kept Putin close, abandoning his seat at a formal G-20 dinner to go sit beside him, like a teenager at lunch in middle school. Just last week, Trump\u2019s own FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that Trump had yet to ask for an investigation of Russia\u2019s meddling although he was concerned enough to have started one on his own. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Not at all. To Trump, the indictments didn\u2019t implicate him; they incriminated Barack Obama. To prove his point, \u00a0he ordered Attorney General Jeff Sessions to launch an investigation into why, if interference was such a problem, Obama didn\u2019t do more. This ignores that Obama sanctioned four Russian individuals, five agencies including the GRU, expelled 35 diplomats, and closed two vacation compounds. Compared to Trump doing, well, nothing.\nTrump didn\u2019t just do nothing, he welcomed Russia\u2019s help. Trump keeps it simple, declaring he loves those who love him. Russia spread the dirt without his fingerprints on it and he returned the love in the form of a stance toward Russia so positive that his most ardent allies can\u2019t countenance it. \nWaxman notes that July 21 wasn\u2019t only the date Trump became his party\u2019s nominee to be president of the United States. It was also the date he may someday come to rue when he became subject to its bribery law. \nLast week Trump jumped on the statement by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that there was \u201cno allegation in the indictment [of the Russians] that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity\u201d as exoneration of him. But the operative phrase there is \u201cin the indictment.\u201d With Trump aides flipping like pancakes at a state party fundraising breakfast, there are almost certainly indictments to come.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/this-is-the-law-that-could-take-down-trump?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Margaret Carlson", "body": "In many ways, Jared Kushner won\u2019t be any worse off than prior presidential family members working in the White House.

If he tries to enter the Situation Room, a large person talking into his wrist will bar him. \u00a0\nBut these limitations didn\u2019t stop Webb Hayes (Rutherford B.\u2019s chief of staff), John Eisenhower (aide-de-camp to and son of Ike), Alice Roosevelt (Teddy\u2019s right-hand woman and eldest daughter) or Bobby Kennedy (so infamous for being JFK\u2019s attorney general a law was passed to keep it form happening again) from influential positions counseling presidents of the same surname. \nSixteen children of Presidents officially worked in the White House, by the estimate of author Doug Wead in All the Presidents' Children, and even more unofficially.

Daughter Anna moved in to the White House in 1943 filling the role of First Lady leaving Eleanor to turn her ceremonial role into a substantive one.\nBut in Kushner\u2019s case, given his portfolio, his demotion to the kid\u2019s table could prove fatal. Trump flouted the anti-nepotism rules like every other norm, whether giving up his business, releasing his tax returns, or accounting for the money he promised to charity. \nTrump giving Kushner and his daughter Ivanka jobs in the West Wing was just another example of doing as he pleases with the swagger of a businessman from New York who isn\u2019t going to make governing so much harder than it needs to be. Kushner was given authority to stick his fingers in every pie so that the wattage of any number of other experienced officials was seriously dimmed. Rex who? H.R. Mc Master did what? Trump gave the crown jewel of our foreign policy to Kushner with a mandate to bring peace to the Middle East, as if what\u2019s been lacking in the region all these years is for a fresh, untutored mind to take a stab at reconciling blood enemies. \n\n\u201cThere have been few glittery evenings to be had, no dinners in the residence with movie stars or historians, the first White House in decades not to hold a State Dinner in the first year.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s disdain for his national security team is not as toxic as his shaming of his attorney general, it\u2019s more dangerous, as intercepts reveal Kushner has gone rogue with impunity, taking and making calls to and from foreign leaders, some of whom only want to deal with ing\u00e9nue Kushner because he\u2019s so \u201cna\u00efve\u201d and \u201ceasily manipulated,\u201d according to the Washington Post read out of intercepts. \u00a0\u00a0\nMost of the other underwhelming family members who\u2019ve failed spectacularly had no power bestowed on them but used their DNA to grab some. At the top of the list in recent years would be Donald Nixon (brother Dick tapped his phone after Don got a large loan from defense contractor Howard Hughes to save his failing burger business); Billy Carter (drank way too much of his eponymous beer and lobbied for Libya); Neil Bush (lucrative business deals, admitted encounters with escorts, and a sordid divorce); Roger Clinton (rock non-stardom after getting out of prison for dealing cocaine); both of Hillary Clinton\u2019s brothers (importing hazelnuts from a former Soviet country and pocketing $200,000 for helping drug dealer friends with presidential pardons). \nIt was only a matter of time before chief of staff John Kelly moved in to stop Jarvanka, with Kushner up first. From the moment he arrived, his main task was really to build a wall around the Oval Office. He blocked those with a hall pass from floating in and out, including, to their consternation, Kushner and Ivanka, a turn of events that must make them regret pushing out former chief of staff Reince Prebius. In the hole after keeping Rob Porter on after domestic violence delayed his security clearance and with no margin for error when it comes to women\u2019s issues, Trump gave Kelly total discretion. He happily grabbed it as a chance at redemption for his lying about the Porter fiasco, and because he finds Kushner and Ivanka dilettantes. \nThe White House insists that multiyear lapses in clearances happen all the time when, of course, they do not. The only thing Trump can do for Kushner now is to grant him a presidential waiver. It would be wrong, usually not an impediment to presidential action in this White House. But more significantly it could lead to Kelly\u2019s resignation when there is no one willing to take such a perilous job. \nIt\u2019s more likely to send Kushner and Ivanka the way of Hope Hicks, sooner rather than later. Their capitol life is a comedown from the heady days when they moved to a white house on the hill in a leafy neighborhood close to their jobs in the other White House. They not only expected to enjoy the fruits of power and influence but to be rescued from the brink of bankruptcy on a flagship building on Fifth Avenue. It wasn\u2019t working out that way even before the smackdown of Kushner. The strain on Ivanka showed earlier this week when she scolded NBC\u2019s Peter Alexander for asking an \u201cinappropriate\u201d question about her father\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct in a whispery voice dripping with \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d hauteur. \nThere have been few glittery evenings to be had, no dinners in the residence with movie stars or historians, the first White House in decades not to hold a State Dinner in the first year.

But by all indications, the president is less amenable to the concerns of his own FBI than those shared by a less formal, more bombastic adviser.That adviser is Sean Hannity, who has been hyping the so-called Nunes memo all week, and with whom the president continues to speak regularly.According to three sources with knowledge of their conversations, Trump has been in regular contact with Hannity over the phone in recent weeks, as the Fox News primetime star and Trump ally has encouraged the prompt release of a controversial four page memo crafted by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. Hannity has gone to the wall to push for the public release of the memo, which the Intelligence Committee and its chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), authorized this week in a party-line vote despite the classified information therein.Sources say Hannity\u2019s persistent advocacy reinforced Trump\u2019s already growing determination to get that memo into the public realm\u2014despite huge potential fallout within the law enforcement and intelligence arms of his own administration.In their conversations, Trump and Hannity discussed the Nunes memo\u2019s supposed bombshell-level significance, and how it could shed light on the alleged anti-Trump bias and \u201ccorruption\u201d at the FBI. On these calls, Trump has directly referenced specific recent Hannity segments related to #ReleaseTheMemo, according to one of three sources with knowledge of their conversations.The White House press office did not respond to requests for comment, and Hannity declined to comment. Sources, two in the White House and the other an outside adviser, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.Trump not only deeply values the private, after-hours political and policy advice and gossip from his favorite cable news hosts, but is a notoriously avid consumer of their broadcasts, particularly highly sympathetic shows like Hannity and Fox  Friends. As he has inched closer to publicly releasing the Nunes memo\u2014he has privately said it\u2019s all but a foregone conclusion\u2014cable news and right-wing media have shaped his views on the issue, as they have on many other topics, far more so than the briefings or private intelligence provided by those within his administration, White House officials say.On Monday afternoon, the day before President Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, the White House summoned some of the president\u2019s most trusted allies and outside advisers to the Entrance Hall in the official residence.

In some cases, he cited specific TV interviews and segments from the past weeks that he found particularly compelling and fun to watch. Some attendees were surprised at how closely the president of the United States had been watching them.

The effort is helmed by a small cohort of career Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials, and has been underway since the Obama administration, according to an ICE official familiar with the matter. Internal advocates for joining the America\u2019s spy agencies\u2014known as the Intelligence Community or the IC\u2014focus on the potential benefits to the agency\u2019s work on counterproliferation, money laundering, counterterror, and cybercrime. The official added that joining the IC could also be useful for the agency\u2019s immigration enforcement work\u2013\u2013in particular, their efforts to find and arrest undocumented immigrants with criminal arrest warrants (known in ICE as fugitive aliens). But civil liberties advocates and government watchdog groups\u2014as well as some current and former U.S. officials\u2014are concerned at the prospect of the nation\u2019s immigration enforcers joining the ranks of America\u2019s spies.\u201cThe idea that ICE could potentially get access to warrantless surveillance is frankly terrifying,\u201d Jake Laperruque, senior counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, told The Daily Beast. \u201cThe idea that ICE could potentially get access to warrantless surveillance is frankly terrifying.\u201d\u2014 The Project on Government Oversight's Jake LaperruquePatrick Toomey, an attorney with the ACLU\u2019s National Security Project, also expressed concern. \u201cThe prospect of ICE joining the Intelligence Community, if true, should sound alarm bells,\u201d he said. \u201cSuch a move threatens to give an agency responsible for domestic immigration enforcement access to a vast pool of sensitive information collected by our spy agencies for foreign intelligence purposes. Those spying tools do not belong in the hands of ICE agents.\u201dIf ICE joins the Intelligence Community, then its officials will have increased access to raw intelligence, unfiltered by analysts. This could prove useful to both of the agency\u2019s components: Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which investigates transnational crimes, including drug trafficking, money laundering, cybercrimes, and arms trafficking; and Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), which arrests and detains undocumented immigrants. \u201cICE has for the past decade been keenly interested in joining the Intelligence Community,\u201d Peter Vincent, general counsel for ICE under the Obama administration, told The Daily Beast. \u201cICE officials have felt that by doing so, they would have greater prestige and credibility and authority.\u201dThe question is: at what price?ICE\u2019s two components sometimes work together on operations. Both components\u2013\u2013HSI and ERO\u2013\u2013could face challenges if the agency joins the Intelligence Community. Unlike most intelligence agencies, which focus on gathering information about America\u2019s adversaries, ICE\u2019s agents and officers deal with federal courts every day. If they use classified material to generate leads, that information could be inadmissible in court. Both the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, which are in the Intelligence Community, deal with this issue. Adjusting would be a challenge for ICE.

While Trump frequently lambasts the FBI, he has yet to say anything critical of ICE, the agency which arrests and detains undocumented immigrants. A former senior ICE official told The Daily Beast that one possible outcome would be that part of ICE\u2019s internal Office of Intelligence could join the IC. The former official added that some ICE officials currently have access to unfinished intelligence and counterintelligence products called Intelligence Information Reports. Joining the IC would give the agency greater access, a seat at the table to potentially influence the IC\u2019s priorities, and a greater ability to share intelligence it gathers with the broader IC. ICE officials would need additional training on how to minimize data involving U.S. persons the agency shares throughout the Intelligence Community, the former official added. Right now, ICE data on U.S. persons\u2013\u2013meaning, all citizens, as well as non-citizens in the U.S.\u2013\u2013isn\u2019t automatically minimized, the official said. So officials would need training on how to protect U.S. persons\u2019 identities before sharing their information throughout the broader IC\u2013\u2013training which would be doable, but would take effort. Trump could put ICE in the IC by executive order, though that would be unusual. A lengthy process is more likely. First, ICE officials would have to get approval of their efforts from Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

There is no federal minimum age requirement for long guns. As\u00a0The Washington Post pointed out, if a father wants to buy his young son a rifle for his birthday, it is perfectly legal for him to do so in much of the country.Twenty-three states have set minimum age requirements for the ownership of long guns, ranging from 14 in Minnesota to 21 in Illinois and Hawaii. In the District of Columbia, a person has to be 21 to own a long gun unless they have parental consent, in which case they only have to be 18. In Florida, where the mass shooting took place, the minimum age requirement for owning a long gun is 18.Handguns are subject to much stricter requirements. A 1995 Bureau of Justice Statistic\u00a0report\u00a0found that handguns were involved in more than 85 percent of gun related crime. Handguns were involved in 57 percent of all homicides (including non-gun related killings), while rifles were connected to just 3 percent.But assault-style rifles have been involved in many of the high-profile mass shootings over the last six years. In 2012, Adam Lanza used an rifle made by\u00a0Bushmaster\u00a0to kill twenty children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Omar Mateen was armed with a\u00a0Sig Sauer rifle\u00a0when he massacred 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Florida two years ago. Stephen Paddock reportedly had multiple assault-style rifles when he sprayed bullets into a crowd of Las Vegas concertgoers in October, killing 58 and injuring hundreds.Last year, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals declared assault-style rifles\u00a0weapons of war. The ruling meant that Americans did not have an unfettered right to buy such rifles under the Second Amendment and that states were free to regulate them. Seven states and the District of Columbia\u00a0have banned\u00a0such rifles. Florida is not one of them.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/heres-why-american-teenagers-can-buy-ar-15s?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Sam Stein", "body": "The Trump White House spent the latter part of this week teasing the likelihood that someone was going to be fired. It could be a National Security Adviser. Or the HUD secretary. Perhaps the chief of staff. Or all of them. \nBy Friday morning, senior Trump administration officials were wondering if their own jobs were even safe. And then\u2026.. nothing happened. The day came and went and no one was let go. Unless they were after this piece was posted. Honestly, it could happen. No one knows, including those sitting inside 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.\nThis is the current state of Trumpland: a presidency conducted like a reality show with no one quite certain of the script. Those close to the president say he revels in the drama that he\u2019s allowing to unfold. But veterans of past White Houses find it both counterproductive and, if they\u2019re being blunt, certifiably insane. \n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what is happening in Trumpworld. Up is down and down is up. Everyone is getting fired and no one is. The cast of Fox and Friends is going to run the National Security Council,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, a former top aide to President Barack Obama. \u201cWe obviously operated differently.\u201d\nFor embattled agency officials in particular, the unfolding drama has fed a sense that, when controversy flares, the West Wing is unhelpful at best and adversarial at worst. \u201cIf there\u2019s a crisis, they\u2019re not there to help us,\u201d as one senior administration official put it. \u201cEach agency operates on its own.\u201d\nInside the administration, some officials have grown convinced that the president and his staff can no longer be relied on to defend top officials from controversy and, indeed, will actively work to worsen a cabinet secretary\u2019s troubles if it means insulating the president from any blame. \nOne official pointed to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson\u2019s staff, which was mostly left to fend for itself this week in the wake of revelations that the secretary spent tens of thousands of dollars on adornments to his office. As a number of cabinet secretaries face scrutiny of their travel habits, that official added, agencies have grown loathe to provide the White House with any information due to concerns that the information will be leaked\u2014or used against those bosses down the line, if they end up on Trump\u2019s bad side.\nEven officials who are not on the president's shortlist for sacking seemingly grasp the risks of providing material on demand. \nTwo knowledgeable West Wing sources have told The Daily Beast that the White House had weeks ago requested that EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt\u2019s staff turn over documents pertaining to Pruitt\u2019s travel expenses. (The administrator is currently facing increased scrutiny after reports surfaced that Pruitt was flying first class on the taxpayer dime.) These sources say that Pruitt\u2019s team has frustrated the White House by \u201cdragging their feet,\u201d according to one source, and not handing over comprehensive documentation of these expenses.\nAs of Friday morning, the EPA still had not produced the requested materials to the White House. One source described it as further evidence of a \u201cbreach of trust\u201d that has become \u201ctoo common\u201d between senior officials at the EPA and the Trump White House.\nEven as it stonewalls the White House, the EPA appears to be working cooperatively with Congress on a nearly identical request. As The Daily Beast reported this week, the EPA missed a deadline for handing over travel records to the House Oversight Committee, but both the committee and the agency said they were working to get those records turned over.\nThe creeping paranoia and feelings of distrust between cabinet agencies and the West Wing are not without merit. Behind the scenes, White House officials and Trump in particular have mused with outside advisers about potential replacements for officials facing controversy\u2014musings that then made their way into press reports of a seemingly imminent high-level purge. On Friday, Axios reported that in an off-the-record meeting with reporters, Chief of Staff John Kelly acknowledged that the president was likely the source of many of those reports. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt keeps everyone uneasy and it likely distracts from their ability to do their job effectively,\u201d Mack McLarty, who served as President Bill Clinton's first White House Chief of Staff said of the constant discord. \u201dWe have kind of normalized chaos here.\u201d \nNo one in Trumpworld is more exposed to that normalized chaos than H.R. McMaster, whose job seems to be perpetually close to an inglorious end. Senior officials told reporters on Thursday that Trump had finally decided put his National Security Adviser out to pasture, only for other officials to clarify that McMaster wasn\u2019t going anywhere\u2014at least not at this immediate second. \n\u201cMcMaster death watch has been going for a long time now; it\u2019s now a matter of who replaces [him] and when,\u201d is how one senior White House official described it to The Daily Beast on Thursday evening. \u201cIt could be National Security Adviser [John] Bolton, it could be Geraldo. Place your bets.\u201d\nOn Thursday night, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted, \u201cJust spoke to [Trump] and Gen. H.R. McMaster - contrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC.\u201d A White House official later told The Daily Beast that the tweet was calculated and \u201ccarefully worded,\u201d noting \u201cnothing in there [is] a lie.\u201d\nSpeculation has also swirled around Kelly\u2019s future, only to (as in McMaster\u2019s case) be hastily downplayed as Beltway gossip. By mid-day Friday the White House was assuring reporters that Trump and his chief of staff had smoothed out their differences, which stemmed from the firing of White House staff secretary and alleged wife beater Rob Porter last month.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin has been on thin ice over the misuse of taxpayer funds. But his standing has been hurt even further as White House officials have agitated for a replacement.\nProminent Trump allies publicly state that all is well, the change can be good\u2014including for the ousted\u2014and that a little bit of uncertain can prompt harder work and energy. \n\u201cThis is normal turnover that you get in any administration from time to time,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s former press secretary Marc Lotter, who left the administration on his own accord last year, told The Daily Beast. \u201cObviously, they are 14 months in. These jobs are mentally and physically demanding. So, I think you do see that natural transition in bringing in some new faces and new ideas, and folks to deal with these high-stress and mentally taxing positions.\u201d\nBut not everyone is convinced that the president is playing a game of three-dimensional chess as he lets his top aides and cabinet members wonder if they\u2019ll have a job in the coming day. \n\u201cTo say what he is doing is mind games would be like calling a monkey throwing his feces art,\u201d said Pfeiffer. \u201cI don't think he knows what he is doing.\u201d", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-is-mindfking-his-own-cabinet-and-senior-staff?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Betsy Woodruff", "body": "Cambridge Analytica hoped to capitalize on Russian hacking of Hillary Clinton and her ally, an email written by one of its employees indicates. \nEmily Cornell, the employee, sent the email on July 29, 2016.

According to Mueller\u2019s indictment, which heavily relied on findings by The Daily Beast, the baker\u2019s dozen were linked to a Kremlin-backed troll farm, the Internet Research Agency, and \u201chad as its object impairing, obstructing and defeating the lawful governmental functions of the United States by dishonest means in order to enable the Defendants to interfere with U.S. political and electoral processes, including the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\u201d\u201cI know this is a slow-moving story, the [Russia probe] indictments\u2026but this was big today,\u201d offered Maher at the top of his monologue. \u201c[Mueller] indicted 13 Russian nationals [and] three Russian companies for their plot to use social media to rat-fuck our 2016 election.

I have great respect for them. I'm not at all upset that I\u2019m on this list. If they want to see the devil\u2014let them see one.\u201d Mueller charged that the troll farm engaged in identity theft and established fraudulent social-media accounts to spread propaganda to targetable audiences both pro- and anti-Trump. As The Daily Beast has extensively detailed, the Russians pounced on issues from immigration to racialized policing to gun violence. The objective was \u201csupporting radical groups, users dissatisfied with [the] social and economic situation and oppositional social movements,\u201d echoing the intelligence assessment\u2019s central view that Russia began its election interference to heighten domestic U.S. political discord.Deniability of their Russian origin came through stealing and falsifying American passports, driver\u2019s licenses, Social Security numbers, and birthdates, which they used to establish American identities tied to online ads and social-media accounts. One such false identity was the alias \u201cMatt Skiber,\u201d Mueller charged, who offered to an unwitting Trump supporter aid facilitating a \u201cMarch For Trump\u201d rally.

Richard Pinedo operated a scheme to sell Americans bank account numbers and other services to \u201cto circumvent the security features of large online digital payment companies.\u201d Among his suppliers was an unnamed \u201cindividual he knew to be outside the United States.\u201d The indictment charges that they routed money through at least six banks and PayPal. Among their marks, Mueller charges, were \u201cunwitting members, volunteers, and supporters of the Trump Campaign involved in local community outreach, as well as grassroots groups that supported then-candidate Trump.\u201d Believing they were dealing with other Americans, those Trump supporters \u201cdistributed [IRA] materials through their own accounts via retweets, reposts and similar means.\u201d \u201cThe Russian troll farm organized rallies echoing Trump\u2019s \u2018Lock Her Up\u2019 theme for Clinton.

John Kennedy (R-LA), a Trump ally, told The Daily Beast.\nTrump\u2019s gun-grabbing moment, of course, would be another addition to the ongoing trend of senior Trump aides claiming after the fact that the president did not say what he, in fact, said publicly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s to the effect of: the president was not talking about violating anyone\u2019s rights, he was talking about keeping guns out of the hands of violent, mentally unstable people and criminals,\u201d one official said, explaining what a canned response would look like.\nIn the course of an hour, Trump cast aside other key pillars of Republican orthodoxy on gun rights. \nHe endorsed legislation first pushed by the Obama White House to expand federal background checks for private gun sales, shot down GOP efforts to expand the rights of concealed carry permit-holders, and even suggested reviving a Democratic measure to ban \u201cassault weapons.\u201d\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), who has pushed an assault-weapons ban for years, was visibly giddy as the president suggested including that measure in congressional gun-control legislation. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get it passed,\u201d the president then declared.\nFor Trump, it was a reversion to positions he held nearly two decades ago. In his 2000 book, The America We Deserve, Trump wrote, \"I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.\u201d \nAfter returning to the Capitol, Democrats who attended the meeting were elated but cautious that the president could renege on his promises like he did on immigration, when he promised to sign whatever legislation Congress sends him.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t mince words about it. I don\u2019t understand how, then, he could back away from that,\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much clearer he could have been.\u201d\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) said the onus is on Trump to deliver GOP votes on a comprehensive background-checks bill.\n\u201cHe asked why nothing has happened. The reason why nothing has happened is because Republicans have given the NRA veto power on background-checks legislation,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIf the president is the deal maker, the closer that he claims to be, then he will deliver Republican votes on a background checks bill.\u201d\n\u2014Andrew Desiderio contributed reporting.", "link": null, "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Scott Bixby", "body": "Sam Nunberg, stop your mouth from moving.\nThat\u2019s the legal consensus among some of the country\u2019s top criminal defense attorneys when asked how they would counsel the onetime Trump campaign adviser, whose Triangle Shirtwaist-scale flameout on Monday led confidants\u2014and one anchor\u2014to worry if he was drunk-dialing cable news hosts.\n\u201cI would tell him that he\u2019s had his fun, now put on your big-boy pants, shut up and hire a lawyer,\u201d said Charles Clayman, founding partner and chair of Clayman  Rosenberg LLP.

In 2005, she helped destroy 92 videotapes showing their torture. She faced no consequences for those actions, and, assuming senators ask about them at her upcoming confirmation hearing, it\u2019s likely that her answers will be given in a closed, secret session.\nBut Haspel\u2019s actions may well have violated international law, specifically the UN Convention against Torture. Could she face prosecution?\nLegally speaking, yes. But politically, almost certainly not.\nThere are two legal avenues for a case against Haspel. The first is the International Criminal Court (ICC), and the second is a domestic court of a European nation. \nThe ICC is a better fit conceptually. Its entire purpose is to prosecute people for \u201cgenocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and aggression.\u201d And despite legal counsel provided to the Bush administration at the time, the kinds of torture which Haspel supervised when she oversaw a CIA \u201cblack site\u201d in Thailand are almost certainly violations of the UN Convention against Torture. \nMary Ellen O\u2019Connell, professor of international law at Notre Dame Law School, told The Daily Beast that Haspel \u201cclearly broke the law\u2026 Every member of the CIA is aware that the U.S. is a party to the Convention against Torture. Even members of the military would have had the duty to disobey a manifestly unlawful order from superiors to use torture.\u201d\nNot only did Haspel not disobey orders, some experts believe that she gave them herself, while supervising the interrogation of Zubaydah and Nashiri, and subsequently destroyed the tapes. The answers may be in the 6,000-page Senate intelligence committee report on torture during the Bush administration that remains classified (only the 524-page executive summary is authorized for release).\n\n\u201cEvery member of the CIA is aware that the U.S. is a party to the Convention against Torture. Even members of the military would have had the duty to disobey a manifestly unlawful order from superiors to use torture.\u201d\n\u2014 Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell, professor of International Law at Notre Dame\n\nMoreover, O\u2019Connell noted, the ICC itself is \u201cunder pressure, with developing world countries leaving, for the court to look even handed.\u201d Nearly all ICC prosecutions have thus far been of Africans; a high-profile investigation of a sitting CIA director would help dispel concerns that the ICC is biased in favor of \u201cfirst world\u201d defendants.\nThe problem with the ICC is jurisdiction. Under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which established the ICC in 1998, the court can only hear of abuses that were either committed by an ICC member nation or took place within an ICC member nation. The United States is not a member: It signed the Rome Statute, but the Senate didn\u2019t ratify it. \nThailand, where Haspel\u2019s black site was located\u2014at the international airport outside Bangkok\u2014is in the same situation. It\u2019s a signatory, but not a member. \nThe only way that Haspel could be prosecuted at the ICC, then, is if she had responsibility for war crimes that took place in another country that, unlike Thailand, is an ICC member nation. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nThe most likely candidate is Poland, where the CIA operated another black site, but it is not known whether Haspel had responsibility for that site, or exactly what took place there. \nIn other words, the ICC may not have jurisdiction at all, and absent additional leaks, it\u2019s hard to see them gaining any information about what did or didn\u2019t happen in Poland.\nEven Haspel\u2019s testimony to the Senate may be of little use. It is common practice for intelligence officers to request a closed hearing for matters related to national security, and until the Russia Investigation, it was unheard of for members of Congress to divulge the records of such hearings. \nAt Haspel\u2019s public hearing, you can expect her to refuse to answer any question that has to do with torture, black sites, extraordinary rendition, on the grounds it could compromise national security\u2014to say nothing of her own prosecution.\nSo much, then, for the ICC. What about the second option: domestic courts in other countries?\nAndrew Novak, professor of international law at George Mason University, told The Daily Beast that \u201cmany countries have universal jurisdiction laws when the law of nations has been violated, as in cases of torture, slavery, or genocide. They would have jurisdiction if someone\u2019s not being prosecuted elsewhere.\u201d\nMoreover, \u201cafter Rwanda and Yugoslavia, there are very broad laws to prosecute war crimes,\u201d Novak said.\nThis has happened before. According to O\u2019Connell, cases against Americans implicated in torture have proceeded in Spain, Italy, and Belgium. For example, O\u2019Connell said, \u201cItaly issued arrest warrants for CIA agents involved in the kidnapping and rendition of a Muslim cleric. One of the agents\u2026 was arrested on the warrant and held for a time in Panama. Another woman was arrested in Portugal a few months ago.\u201d\nA similar process is already underway in Haspel\u2019s case. In Germany, the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), has filed a series of complaints with the country\u2019s federal prosecutor, urging him to investigate.\nAndreas Sch\u00fcller, director of ECCHR\u2019s International Crimes and Accountability Program, told The Daily Beast that this campaign has been going on for years. \u201cIn 2014, when the Senate report on the CIA came out, we filed a brief criminal complaint\u2026 They opened a preliminary examination\u2014not yet an investigation, but a file that establishes the initial suspicion to open a case.\u201d\nIn 2015 and 2016, ECCHR filed two more extended complaints, one regarding the Army\u2019s alleged torture of inmates at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, and a second on the CIA\u2019s alleged torture at black sites.\n\u201cIn 2016, Gina Haspel\u2019s name was not known,\u201d Sch\u00fcller said, \u201cbut when she was nominated as vice-director of the CIA last year, we had a name to connect to other facts we had presented already.\u201d \nNow, the ECCHR says, \u201cGina Haspel must face arrest on traveling to Europe.\u201d\nBut would the German federal prosecutor really go after the the CIA director, when such a move would gravely damage U.S.-German relations? \nSch\u00fcller agreed it was unlikely.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect to see that move,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we want to achieve is to say: look, there was torture, there is the UN Convention Against Torture, and you [the government] know who this person is. If you allow her to come here, you are making a clear political decision that you prioritize that over your obligations under the Convention Against Torture\u2026 They can\u2019t say they didn\u2019t know who was coming here.\u201d\nMoreover, Sch\u00fcller added, \u201cthe legal accountability debate continues and makes life at least a little bit harder for the people making those decisions [to conduct torture]. It\u2019s something they have to take into account.\u201d\nIn sum, while the actions documented in the Senate\u2019s report would be strong grounds for a war crimes prosecution of Gina Haspel, it\u2019s very unlikely that anyone will make use of them.

On at least 19 different occasions, candidate Trump insisted the unemployment numbers were cooked. \u00a0At a media event in September 2015, for instance, Trump bashed the rate, which stood at 5.3 percent, as \u201csuch a phony number,\u201d and \u201cthe biggest joke there is in this country.\u201d The actual rate, he claimed, fell somewhere between 18 and 32 percent, maybe even 42 percent. As late as December 2016, Trump was calling the jobs numbers \u201ctotally fiction.\u201d \u00a0But all this was while Barack Obama was president. Once Trump was inaugurated, the numbers became real.\nAfter the first jobs report of 2017 was released, which revealed the unemployment rate was continuing its downward trend set under Obama, reporters asked Sean Spicer if Trump still believed the report was phony. \u00a0\u201cI talked to the president prior to this,\u201d Spicer said, \u201cand he said to quote him very clearly: 'They may have been phony in the past, but it\u2019s very real now.'\u201d Huh?\nTrump\u2019s derision of the unemployment rate\u2014like his derision of the press, intelligence community, justice department, and federal judiciary\u2014was typical cynical political maneuvering; in this case, an attempt to puncture Obama\u2019s record on jobs, which was in fact excellent. During Obama\u2019s presidency, the U.S. saw 75 straight months of job growth, the longest streak in American history. Unemployment under Obama plunged from nearly 10 percent in late 2009 to 4.8 percent when he left office. The stock market, too, did extremely well under Obama, as the Dow Jones nearly tripled from 6,800 when he took office to almost 20,000 when he left. (While GDP didn\u2019t grow particularly well under Obama, it remained sluggish in virtually every developed country in the world, indicating significant global factors at play.)\nIn addition to Obama\u2019s record-setting jobs streak and tripling of the Dow, consumer confidence and wages were trending upward when he left office. And despite Trump\u2019s relentless boasting about his own \u201ceconomic revival,\u201d the 1.7 million new jobs added in 2017 were surpassed by Obama in five out of seven years (excluding 2009, which was before Obama\u2019s policies went into effect). All this following the most devastating economic crisis since the Great Depression.\n\n\u201cThere are signs that a severe economic downturn will occur under Trump\u2014just as one has occurred under every Republican president since Reagan.\u201d\n\nBut talk to your typical Trump supporter and they will insist Obama was a disaster for the economy. Ask them about Trump\u2019s first year in office, however, and they will point to the economy as proof he\u2019s done a terrific job. \u00a0Never mind Trump\u2019s stripping away of environmental protections (toxic waste, methane leaks, and drinking water pollutants are no longer regulated as strictly); his profiting from public office (Mar-A-Lago\u2019s membership fees doubled to $200,000 last year); normalization of lies (the Washington Post counts more than 2,000 Trump falsehoods since he\u2019s taken office); demonization of the press; shrinking of our national parks; intimidation of federal judges; coarsening of our culture; cheating on his wife and allegedly paying hush money to a porn star; failure to fix health care; abandonment of Puerto Rico; or even that the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists advanced its Doomsday Clock to \u201ctwo minutes to midnight\u201d largely because of Trump\u2019s belligerence toward North Korea. The economy, say his supporters, is what we should focus on.\nThe economy is, indeed, robust. But let\u2019s not forget that the economy was robust under the last Republican president, George W. Bush, until it wasn\u2019t. Trump\u2019s tax cuts, as the Guardian recently pointed out, are set to kick in \u201cat the worst possible moment,\u201d with rising interest rates looming and a \u201cdanger of the economy overheating.\u201d Indeed, there are signs that a severe economic downturn will occur under Trump\u2014just as one has occurred under every Republican president since Reagan. \u00a0Conservative economic philosophy over the past 40 years has been remarkably myopic: reflexively cut taxes and slash regulations to give the economy a quick boost, future budgets be damned. As then-vice-president Dick Cheney infamously asserted when justifying budget shortfalls under George W. Bush: \u201cReagan proved deficits don\u2019t matter.\u201d In fact, Reagan\u2019s reduction of the top income tax rate from 70 percent to 28 percent and his tripling of the national debt have been widely blamed for the Bush I recession.\nAlong with Trump\u2019s ill-advised tax cuts\u2014that are expected to add more than $1 trillion to the national debt\u2014the president has slashed regulations at a feverish pace. Reagan, Bill Clinton (the \u201cnew Democrat\u201d who borrowed many of his financial policies from conservatives), and George W. Bush all notably cut regulations on the financial industry. We saw how that worked out. Slashing regulations, like cutting taxes, typically excites industry and provides a short-term boost to the economy. But less oversight almost invariably leads to risky, reckless behavior. It\u2019s no coincidence that the big financial scandals of recent decades have occurred under Republican administrations. The junk bond scandal of the \u201980s, the Enron collapse of 2001, and the 2008 global financial meltdown were all fueled by deregulation, fraud, and lack of transparency.\nOne major piece of regulation that Trump (with bipartisan support in the Senate) has begun chipping away at is Dodd-Frank, the Wall Street reform bill Obama signed in the wake of the 2008 crisis. By increasing oversight of financial firms, Dodd-Frank helped stabilize our financial system, allowing the stock market to begin its steady climb that has lasted through the present (two of three major market indexes grew more during Obama\u2019s first year than Trump\u2019s). Commercial banks were more profitable than ever in 2016, yet Trump Tweeted that Obama\u2019s regulations \u201chave been devastating.\u201d So he appointed Mick Mulvaney as the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2014\u201ca guy who doesn\u2019t even believe the CFPB. should exist,\u201d one critic charged\u2014and his Treasury Department is trying to make it easier for banks to avoid the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d label that would subject them to more oversight. Wall Street penalties have already plummeted under Trump. But even Trump\u2019s own Office of Management and Budget vindicated Obama\u2019s regulatory approach. In its annual report, released last month, the non-partisan OMB found that the benefits of Obama-era regulations far exceeded the costs.\nIn a 2004 interview with Wolf Blitzer, citizen Donald Trump observed that \u201cthe economy does better under the Democrats than the Republicans,\u201d adding, \u201cwe\u2019ve had some pretty bad disasters under the Republicans.\u201d \u00a0He was being perceptive. In a 2014 paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research, Alan Blinder and Mark Watson examined every presidential administration since World War II. They concluded: \u201cThe U.S. economy has grown faster\u2014and scored higher on many other macroeconomic metrics\u2014when the president of the United States is a Democrat.\u201d Our current president would do well to heed the words of his younger self. He should embrace the Democratic policies that have helped our economy prosper and eschew the Republican policies that dragged our country into those \u201cpretty bad disasters.\u201d", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/its-obamas-economic-recovery-stupid?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kate Briquelet", "body": "Charles Harder, the attorney who destroyed Gawker, has joined President Trump\u2019s legal battle with Stormy Daniels.

Daniels argues the nondisclosure contract is void because it was signed only by Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, and not the president himself.\nCohen drafted up the agreement under a Delaware LLC, Essential Consultants, and paid Daniels $130,000 for her silence.\nA notice of removal filed by attorney Brent Blakeley, who represents Trump and Essential Consultants, states that the NDA that Daniels signed comes with stiff penalties: $1 million per breach of the confidentiality provisions.\nDaniels filed her lawsuit on March 6, knowing that Essential Consultants had initiated an arbitration proceeding on the matter, court papers allege.\nOn March 12, Daniels\u2019 attorney sent Cohen a written proposal to make the NDA \u201cnull and void\u201d in return for the $130,000 payout. \nBut, Trump\u2019s legal team argues, Daniels violated their October 2016 settlement agreement at least 20 times. They argue Essential Consultants and/or Trump can collect as much as $20 million from the porn star. \nStill, the legal filings are the closest President Trump has come to acknowledging he\u2019s the mystery man named in the NDA.\nIn the agreement, the parties used aliases: \u201cPeggy Peterson\u201d and \u201cDavid Dennison.\u201d\nDaniels\u2019 attorney, Michael Avenatti, hinted to the commander-in-chief\u2019s admission on Twitter, after the latest court filing made headlines. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

We are NOT going away and we will NOT be intimidated.\u201d\nAvenatti called the filing \u201cyet another bullying tactic from the president and Mr. Cohen\u201d that would only lead to \u201cprivate arbitration, thus hiding the truth from the public.\u201d\nThe court maneuver followed allegations Friday morning that Daniels had been threatened with \u201cphysical harm\u201d if she went public over her year-long affair with the president.\n\u201cMy client was physically threatened to stay silent about what she knew about Donald Trump,\u201d Avenatti told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo on Friday.\nSpeaking on New Day, Avenatti declined to say whether Trump or anyone close to him was behind the alleged intimidation, which he said had continued after Trump became president.

Let me put it to you this way. Which would you rather have: a bumbler who disagrees with Donald Trump from time to time, or a seemingly efficient bureaucrat who agrees with him almost all of the time? Because we had the former in Rex Tillerson, and soon, in Pompeo, we will have the latter, and that\u2019s a lot more dangerous.\nTillerson was always in over his head and always not-quite-sure what he was doing in the job. His hesitance with the press and that \u201cI\u2019d rather be golfing\u201d expression on his face marked his tenure from the start. He will not exactly live in history alongside George Marshall. \nBut whatever else we may say about him, the fired secretary of state was the Hippocrates of Foggy Bottom: He did no harm\u2014 at least in broader world, that is; he did plenty of harm inside the building, where morale was in the sewer. But he did little to make the geopolitical situation worse. Considering the man he\u2019s working for, in time we may come to appreciate that as a world-historical accomplishment. \nHe kept Trump from blowing up the Iran deal. He hewed to the traditional line on North Korea, which was no talks without some meaningful preconditions. When he got the axe, he was on his way home from a trip to Africa, where he was trying to make amends after Trump\u2019s \u201cshithole\u201d countries remark, and more specifically from Chad, where he was trying to explain to a perplexed capital why the Trump administration added Chad to the travel ban last year and offer hope that the country might be removed.\nWe won\u2019t know the whole story until the memoirs come out\u2014if he bothers\u2014but it would hardly be shocking to learn that Tillerson saved our country from a few international mini-crises.\nPompeo? By all accounts he admires Trump; is for the most part on the same page. He\u2019s been briefing the president daily. They have, as Trump said himself on Tuesday morning, \u201cchemistry.\u201d When I think about what kind of man it takes to develop \u201cchemistry\u201d with Donald Trump, and realize that that man is about to be the United States\u2019 top diplomat, it somehow leaves me less than reassured.\nPompeo will be, in all likelihood, a better manager of the department than Tillerson. He\u2019s been a congressman and he\u2019s been running the CIA. Of course, Tillerson hailed from one of the biggest private companies in the world but Pompeo also knows his way around Washington better than Tillerson did. He\u2019ll fill posts. I\u2019d bet we\u2019ll have an ambassador in Seoul now\u2014one of the more glaring empty diplomatic seats\u2014fairly soon. This is where the positive stories will come in two months from now.\nBut he\u2019ll be filling those posts with hard-liners and Trump loyalists. So now we are likely to see, in a way we did not see for these first 14 months, the president being able to execute his foreign-policy, well, vision.\nSo look for the administration to cancel the Iran deal. Pompeo has been a big critic of it. Look for a harder line, if such is possible, on Israel and the Palestinians. On Russia, Pompeo has taken a far more anti-Putin line than Trump; after all, he heads an agency that is part of the consensus view that Russia meddled in the election to help Trump. Just this past weekend Pompeo challenged Putin\u2019s dismissal of meddling claims as \u201cfalse.\u201d Will Pompeo try to persuade the president of this view, or spend the next few months trying to make his boss forget he ever held it? Count me among those skeptical that the potentially new Secretary of State won\u2019t learn the lessons from the just axed Secretary of State\u2014that fealty to Trump is the key currency. \u00a0\nSo we have no idea what we\u2019re in for. What will Pompeo\u2019s posture be on these allegedly upcoming North Korea talks? (\u201cAllegedly\u201d because I\u2019d bet there\u2019s a chance they don\u2019t actually happen.) If they\u2019re really taking place in a mere two months, that\u2019s an awfully short time for a new secretary of state and a new diplomatic team to get on the same page and try to convince the president to read a memo.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nBut Trump doesn\u2019t think about such things. Nothing about this was planned. Trump was waiting for an excuse, it seems, for a while, and Tillerson appears to him given him the excuse he needed with the Russia comments. But he doesn\u2019t think about consequences in firing his secretary of state any more than he thinks about them when accepting a no-conditions sit down with Kim Jong-Un on the spur of the moment. \nWe were spared one bullet here. Trump didn\u2019t name Tom Cotton to replace Pompeo at CIA, as expected. My guess: The Republicans didn\u2019t want to risk losing a Senate seat. If a Democrat could win in Alabama, as Doug Jones did, maybe one could win in Arkansas too. We have the Republican primary voters of Alabama to thank for that, for nominating a pervert.\nBut we have problems enough.

Devin Nunes (R-CA), alleging partisan behavior by the FBI and the Department of Justice in a \u201cDeep State\u201d conspiracy against Donald Trump is, what we would call in the CIA, \u201cdisinformation.\u201d Tougher words could be used. But let\u2019s put it simply at this: It is a deliberate diversion from the hard facts that the FBI and CIA have been amassing of Russian espionage activity with members of Donald Trump\u2019s entourage. And it presents FBI and CIA officers with a progressively grave constitutional crisis. The Nunes memo makes it difficult for those officers to serve an executive who\u2014evidence increasingly indicates\u2014has betrayed his oath to the Constitution. It also makes it hard for them to serve a legislative oversight committee that is distorting its functions so as to protect that executive. Inside the CIA, where I served for decades, and the FBI, the strongest reaction to the Nunes memo will be anger and alarm. Top officials in both those institutions operate in a manner fundamentally at odds with what is now being depicted. In the CIA, I encountered colleagues with views that ranged from the far right to far left\u2014every view except, perhaps, that of the communists. This broad diversity is also true for my colleagues in the FBI. Indeed, the \u201ccultures\u201d of both institutions are utterly apolitical. Officers take their oaths with sometimes life-sacrificing devotion: To \u201csupport and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\u201d I have been moved literally to tears on numerous occasions by my colleagues\u2019 devotion to our laws and the institutions charged with protecting them; and not to any man, be he president, general, or party leader; nor to any party. CIA and FBI officers seek to give life to James Madison\u2019s hope, expressed in Federalist #10, that our system be impartial and unaffected by non-democratic influences, and that it be \u201cmore difficult for unworthy candidates to practice the vicious arts by which elections are too often carried.\u201d They seek to make sure that no foreign power can affect our elections, plant spies among us, or even choose our leaders and shape our policies.I never saw an officer\u2019s personal views interfere with how the agency performed its duties. Personal political opinions, like cellphones and football pools, are left out of the office. This commitment and motivation is why we spend our careers working for a fraction of what our peers in the private sector earn. Nor do the CIA or the FBI as institutions have political agendas.\u00a0The idea of the \u201cDeep State\u201d opposing elected leaders and the rule of law is\u2014I will be blunt here\u2014a fascist concept, which is intended to discredit the institutions of democracy. It is done, precisely, so that a \u201cLeader\u201d can represent the \u201cpeople\u201d without the encumbrance of law or representative institutions. Most CIA and FBI officers share my alarm that such a distorting and harmful term has even entered American political discussions. Those who use the term \u201cDeep State\u201d frankly disqualify themselves from public life in a democracy. If anything, the Nunes memorandum shows how carefully the FBI, CIA, and Department of Justice protect an individual from any official abuse. The memorandum notes that at least five senior officials, from three separate departments, on seven different occasions, every 90 days, had to review the FBI\u2019s request to investigate Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. That was before they passed the request to the separate Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court that grants or denies the requests. And all of this occurred each time after officers in the rank and file of the FBI had themselves judged that there was sufficient probable cause of espionage activity to merit the request. I have lived this process. Its multiple levels of review make it just about certain that FISA requests are based on solid concern about foreign intelligence activity. So, I can state with confidence that the reaction in the FBI and the CIA to the Nunes memorandum will be disdain for what Madison calls, the \u201cvicious arts\u201d in it. It will be seen for what it truly is: an attempt to protect what appears to be the Trump entourages\u2019 ties to Russian intelligence. And there will be irritation at the groundless slurs it casts on FBI officers, and anger at the harm it could cause the FBI, the CIA, and the Department of Justice.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-deep-state-conspiracy-is-how-fascists-discredit-democracy?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Gideon Resnick", "body": "Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court released a new congressional map for the Keystone state on Monday afternoon and in the process gave Democrats a likely major boost in their efforts to win back control of the House of Representatives this fall.The redrawn map\u2014which was offered as a legally-mandated fix to the heavily gerrymandered prior lines\u2014reshapes the state such that, according to Cook Political Report\u2019s Dave Wasserman, there are now eight Hillary Clinton districts and ten Donald Trump districts. President Trump won the state in the 2016 election by less than one percentage point. There are currently five seats held by Democrats and 12 by Republicans, with one vacant. The map is likely to be the most significant mid-term election development until the actual election itself, seriously enhancing the likelihood that Nancy Pelosi regains her gavel as Speaker. For that, and other reasons, it is also likely to draw a legal challenge from Republicans in the state. The new map moves districts from Republican-dominated to lean-Democratic while tightening some districts that remain in GOP hands. The open seat in Republican Rep.

There were no legal consequences 13 years ago when Haspel aided in the destruction of 92 videotapes showing Abu Zubaydah and Abdul Rahim Nashiri\u2019s torture. But now that Haspel is two Senate votes away from running the CIA, a coalition of civil liberties groups is gearing up to ensure that she will at least face political consequences. \nThose groups tell The Daily Beast that they intend to fight Haspel intensely. Their plans are still coming together, and their goal is ambitious: to defeat a CIA director with substantial agency support nominated by a Republican president before a Republican-controlled Senate. But this is a fight they feel compelled to wage, having spent Barack Obama\u2019s presidency loudly warning that without prosecutions for torture, it will be a matter of time before torture returns. \u00a0\n\u201cGina Haspel dishonored our country and disgraced herself by participating in the CIA torture program and the destruction of criminal evidence,\u201d said Wells Dixon of the Center on Constitutional Rights, who is playing a leading role in the emerging effort to block Haspel\u2019s directorship. \u201cWe do not believe she should be director of the CIA. Rather, she should be in jail.\u201d \nCivil liberties groups tend not to win these sorts of congressional fights. But they see Haspel as so directly implicated in waterboarding, mock executions and the persistent physical and mental consequences of those acts that she might prove to be the exception. \n\u201cWe absolutely think we can defeat her,\u201d said Raha Wala of Human Rights First, another key figure in the coalition. \u201cNever have we faced a nominee so directly and operationally linked to a widespread torture program by the CIA. This really is a historic nomination.\u201d\nThe stakes for all involved are substantial, and they explain the depth of the opposition to Haspel. \nThe CIA\u2019s primary fear around the torture program it conducted during the Bush administration has been exposing its personnel to criminal consequences. It has Barack Obama to thank for that not happening. But the agency is highly mindful of the political consequences for the generation of officers that took part in the program, which is one reason why it waged such vociferous opposition to the Senate intelligence committee\u2019s investigation of torture. (Ironically, Haspel and her boss Jose Rodriguez\u2019s fateful decision to destroy the torture tapes directly prompted the Senate investigation.) \nNow comes Haspel, a career CIA official by all accounts well respected by her colleagues over a 30-plus year career. She\u2019s the first CIA director nominee since William Colby in the 1970s who would come to the job directly from the agency ranks without time on the outside\u200d. Accordingly, former senior intelligence luminaries have lined up behind her, suggesting in a Cipher Brief roundtable that she\u2019ll be a counterweight to Trump deeply trusted by Langley and downplaying her role in torture. (\u201cGina Haspel did precisely what the agency and the nation asked her to do,\u201d wrote Mike Hayden, who presided over the terminal phase of the torture program as CIA director.) \nWhile some officials involved in the legal aspects of the torture program have been nominated for higher appointments, Haspel would be the first such nominee who played an operational role in mock executions and waterboarding. To civil liberties groups, the message a Haspel directorship would send to that generation of CIA officers is \u201cthat torture, or other activity outside the bounds of the law, is not a career-killer,\u201d according to Christopher Anders, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Washington office. \nAnd it\u2019s not just any president who has nominated Haspel. Trump as a candidate spoke rapturously about implementing torture worse than waterboarding, and only Defense Secretary Jim Mattis appears to have swayed Trump. But now that Trump is ousting moderates like Rex Tillerson and elevating hardliners like Mike Pompeo \u2013 who as a congressman adopted an anti-anti-torture posture \u2013 \u201cher appointment as CIA director could lead to a reemergence of torture, either as a matter of policy or in practice,\u201d said Dixon. (Congress in 2015 reiterated the illegality of torture, but civil libertarians are quick to note that torture was illegal when the CIA enacted the Bush-era program in 2002.) \nThe civil-libertarian plan to defeat Haspel is still coalescing, as is its membership. Thus far on board ae Human Rights First, Human Rights Watch, the Center for Victims of Torture, the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, the ACLU, Center for Constitutional Rights, Demand Progress, Open the Government and Amnesty International (where, full disclosure, this reporter\u2019s wife is a senior executive). Some of the campaigns contours are becoming clear as well. \nLater this week, an open letter to the Senate will emerge from many of these prominent civil libertarian groups. It will call for senators to seek a substantial declassification of what, exactly, Haspel did at the Thailand black site she oversaw for Abu Zubaydah and Nashiri\u2019s interrogation. By the CIA\u2019s design, the public record is full of discrepancies and obfuscations, including those within the declassified text of the Senate torture report and the agency\u2019s prevention of Haspel\u2019s deposition in a torture lawsuit. (Similarly, a book from CIA contractor James Mitchell, a co-defendant in that suit that includes a quote from a figure who might be Haspel\u200d mocking a tortured Abu Zubaydah, but it\u2019s not clear.) The groups will argue that those gaps are untenable for oversight of a potential CIA director.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe confirmation hearings are going to be a bad joke if stuff isn\u2019t declassified,\u201d said Katherine Hawkins of the Project on Government Oversight, one of the most tenacious outside investigators of CIA torture. Hawkins, also part of the coalition to defeat Haspel, plans on drafting questions to ask Haspel for Senate staff. \nIn addition to fanning out to the airwaves to warn against Haspel, the groups are targeting key senators, and they see favorable math. They got a big boost on Wednesday, when Kentucky Republican Rand Paul came out against Haspel. In a 51-49 Republican Senate majority, Haspel\u2019s nomination is no sure bet even before the fight begins in earnest. \nBut that depends on the civil libertarians convincing Democrats to stand together against Haspel \u2013 and that\u2019s far from a certain thing, thanks in part to the reflexive fear amongst Democratic leaders about getting tarred as weak on security. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that he\u2019s not instructing Democrats to oppose her \u201cat this point.\u201d And many civil libertarians were disappointed \u2013 even shocked \u2013 that the leading figure behind the torture report, Democrat Dianne Feinstein, did not reject Haspel out of hand, even as she seeks reelection this year in deep-blue California.\nFeinstein told The Daily Beast on Wednesday that she \u201cnever announces a view before the hearing.\u201d\nShe continued: \u201cNo one could doubt how much I care. And anyone that knows what we went through to get this report to see the light of day will understand that. Like everybody, I have to do my due diligence. And I don\u2019t just make a kneejerk opinion. I wait, because I\u2019m on the [Senate intelligence] committee and I have an opportunity to ask questions to do just that,\u201d Feinstein said. \nBut now Paul is to Feinstein\u2019s left on Haspel. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if she has the courage of her convictions to actually vote no,\u201d Paul jabbed on Wednesday. \nCivil libertarians are also looking to a torture survivor to give a few Republicans cover to break with the White House on Haspel and to shore up Democrats: Arizona Republican John McCain. McCain stopped just short of opposing Haspel on Tuesday and called on her to \u201cexplain the nature and extent of her involvement\u201d in torture. Along with Feinstein, McCain was the architect of the successful 2015 amendment formally prohibiting the CIA from returning to torture, so the civil libertarians consider McCain persuadable as a substantial voice against Haspel.\nThe groups believe they have some recent history is on their side. Last year, they came just short of stopping Steven Bradbury, a Bush-era Justice Department official who lent his legal imprimatur to CIA torture, from becoming the senior attorney at the Department of Transportation. Bradbury won 50-47, but all Democrats who voted were against him, as were McCain and Paul. And that was for a position unrelated to national security featuring a nominee without an operational role in torture. Additionally, the McCain-Feinstein amendment passed in 2015 by a wide margin, 78 to 21.\nCivil libertarian groups do not win many major congressional battles. Capitol Hill is typically favorable territory for the security agencies, as crossing them opens politicians up to demagoguery. Liz Cheney, a Wyoming congresswoman whose father Dick was a pivotal architect of the torture program, tweeted that Paul was \u201cdefending and sympathizing with terrorists\u201d by criticizing Haspel.\nBut whether they can succeed against Haspel or not, the civil liberties groups feel they cannot sit out a fight to prevent a woman deeply involved with acts like stuffing a wounded man into a box barely larger than a coffin and threatening another captive with a pistol from running the CIA. \n\u201cEveryone is super revved up on this,\u201d said Human Right First\u2019s Wala. \u201cTorture is the quintessential human rights violation.

As far as Rex Tillerson is concerned I very much appreciate his commitment and his service, and I wish him well, he's a good man.\u201d\nWhite House officials said Trump made the change in preparation for his summit with Kim Jong Un and upcoming trade negotiations.

Any non-ACLJ related work that occurs at the ACLJ offices is reimbursed in compliance with all applicable tax laws.\u201d\nFrom a strictly legal perspective, the arrangement appears above board, so long as ACLJ is charging market rates to rent the space, according to Brendan Fischer, the director of federal reform programs at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit watchdog. \n\u201cThe only way this would be an issue is if ACLJ was offering its services at less than fair market value, or using ACLJ resources without being compensated\u201d by the president, the White House, or the Trump campaign, Fischer said in an email. \nAs Sekulow represents the president in matters related to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, ACLJ has also pursued litigation that, while not directly related to that investigation, aligns with efforts by the president and his allies to deflect from allegations that the Russian government worked to elect Trump in 2016.\nACLJ is currently suing the State Department for records related to U.S. approval for the sale of a Canadian mining company with U.S. uranium interests to a state-owned Russian energy firm. A large shareholder in the Canadian company, Uranium One, was also a major donor to the Clinton Foundation, leading to allegations by President Trump and his allies that Clinton facilitated the sale to Russian firm Rosatom in exchange for contributions to her group.\nClinton\u2019s State Department was just one of nine federal agencies that signed off on the sale. Nevertheless, President Trump has repeatedly invoked the controversy to deflect from allegations that his campaign may have colluded with Russian actors to tip the presidential election in his favor. Congressional Republicans and outside allies have demanded a second special counsel to investigate issues surrounding Clinton\u2019s role in the Uranium One deal.\nACLJ has worked to boost other major talking points used by critics of Mueller\u2019s investigation into the Trump campaign.

Three sources familiar with the situation say the forthcoming Inspector General report will likely fuel criticism of Shulkin\u2019s use of official department resources and could further erode his standing in the administration.\nSources spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss sensitive internal matters. \nReports of the latest IG\u2019s findings have been swirling internally, but its specific allegations are not yet clear. Sources stressed that the IG has been known to qualify language in prior reports and make substantive changes late in the process. These sources expect the watchdog to release its findings in the next two weeks.\nVA spokesperson Curt Cashour referred questions about the report to the IG\u2019s office. That office declined to comment, telling The Daily Beast on Friday that it does not confirm or deny the existence of ongoing investigations.\nShulkin, an Obama-era holdover, is already on thin ice with the White House owing to a separate IG report last month, which found that he improperly expended taxpayer resources so that his wife could join him on a trip to Europe last summer. During that trip, both Shulkin and his wife attended the Wimbledon tennis tournament, claiming (it appears falsely) that they were provided the tickets by a family friend. That report also found that Shulkin\u2019s chief of staff had forged an email, ostensibly showing that Shulkin was slated to receive an award from the Danish government, in order to create a post-facto pretext for his wife\u2019s attendance.\nShulkin\u2019s attorneys vehemently disputed the IG\u2019s findings, and the secretary suggested that his chief of staff\u2019s email account may have been hacked. The IG\u2019s office released a letter this week saying there was no evidence of such an electronic intrusion.\nPublicly, the administration remains fully behind Shulkin. Veterans service organizations met with White House chief of staff John Kelly in the West Wing\u2019s Roosevelt Room on Monday. A source present at the meeting, also attended by Domestic Policy Council director Andrew Bremberg and Office of Public Liaison Deputy Director Jennifer Korn, told The Daily Beast that Kelly expressed the Trump White House\u2019s full \u201cconfidence in\u201d Shulkin and shot down any suggestion that he would be ousted from his position.\nThe White House press office referred questions about the forthcoming report to the VA. As for Shulkin\u2019s standing in the administration, spokesman Ninio Fetalvo noted that press secretary Sarah Sanders, on Thursday, had said that \u201cThe President is glad for the job that [Shulkin]'s been doing in reforming the VA and modernizing the VA.\u201d\nBehind the scenes, however, dissatisfaction with Shulkin is high and there is a sense that his tenure could be coming to a close, with the president and his adviser using the opportunity of damaging reports to find a more ideologically like-minded replacement. \n\"I wouldn't call him a dead man walking,\u201d said one source familiar with the situation, \u201cbut it's close to that.\"\nMultiple sources in and outside of the administration independently noted a significant uptick in Shulkin\u2019s suspiciousness and anxiety of late and have described to him as acting \u201cextremely paranoid.\u201d Two people familiar with the situation said that Shulkin this week had even ordered an armed guard to stand outside his office on the 10th floor of the VA.

Few internally even know which firm has been hired, and two sources told The Daily Beast that VA employees simply refer to it as \u201cthe firm.\u201d\nThe secretary seems determined to purge people from the agency whom he regards as enemies and has claimed he has the White House\u2019s support in doing so. The White House has had to intervene to prevent Shulkin from firing a number of senior political appointees, according to one source familiar with the situation.\nAmong those in Shulkin\u2019s crosshairs is John Ullyot, the VA's assistant secretary for public affairs, who has been trying to convince lawmakers on Capitol Hill to call the White House and explicitly recommend sacking the secretary, according to a USA Today report that also mentioned Cashour by name. (Both denied the report, saying they had never recommended that their boss be removed.) Others who Shulkin views as prominent adversaries are Darin Selnick, a White House veterans affairs adviser, and Jake Leinenkugel, a White House senior adviser on veterans affairs, both of whom Shulkin has reportedly blamed for attempting to subvert or undermine his authority.\nOutside of the building, Shulkin\u2019s standing is precarious. Rep. Mike Coffman, a Colorado Republican on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, officially called for the secretary\u2019s replacement this week in a letter to President Donald Trump.\nBut Shulkin retains some powerful allies in Congress too, including Rep. Phil Roe (R-TN), who chairs the House Veterans Affairs panel. \u201cI know there was a lot of drama last week in Washington,\u201d he said this week at a gathering of the American Legion in Washington. \u201cSecretary Shulkin has done a phenomenal job, and I want to tell you all that I will walk hand-in-hand, arm-in-arm to get the work done that we need to.\u201d\nShulkin has even drawn some lukewarm defenses from progressives who are concerned that his departure would open the door to a more conservative VA secretary who might try to entirely remake the agency\u2019s health system.\n\"David Shulkin has done himself no favors,\u201d Will Fischer, director of government relations at VoteVets, a progressive veterans organization, told The Daily Beast. \u201cWe are not defending his actions.

Before the committee enters a 5 p.m. meeting widely anticipated but not certain to include a vote to declassify the memo, the intelligence committee and the FBI were in negotiations Monday to permit bureau officials a greater modicum of visibility into the memo\u2019s contents, The Daily Beast has learned. It appeared the discussions stopped short of permitting FBI officials to read the brief memo in full. Fox News and CNN reported that Trump\u2019s appointed FBI director, Chris Wray, ventured to Capitol Hill on Sunday to view the memo\u2014another sign that both sides were attempting to reconcile differences that emerged into public view last week. On Wednesday, as House Republicans led a groundswell to, as they put it, #ReleaseTheMemo, the Justice Department\u2019s Hill liaison warned a declassification of the memo that sidestepped the FBI and the department would be \u201cextraordinarily reckless.\u201d \u00a0At issue is a memo prepared by Republican chairman Devin Nunes, who has previously cooperated in secret with White House officials to undermine the Russia inquiries, that purportedly claims Justice Department and FBI officials manipulated the process to surveil suspected assets of a foreign power within the United States. The White House views it as exculpation that senior officials involved in the Russia probe harbor bias against President Trump. According to the Washington Post, Trump views it as a potential pretext for firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees special counsel \u00a0Robert Mueller and has pledged to safeguard Mueller\u2019s independence. In a statement last week, all the Democrats on the intelligence committee called the memo \u201ca misleading set of talking points attacking the FBI\u201d for the political goal of \u201cspreading a false narrative and undermining legitimate investigations.\u201d Declassifying the Nunes memo in the absence of Justice Department-FBI guidance risks revealing information relevant to counterintelligence and providing active or potential surveillance targets with tips for circumventing investigations. The Justice Department\u2019s Stephen Boyd, in his letter last week to the committee, said the department and the bureau sought to review the memo in order to advise on \u201cthe risk of harm to national security and to ongoing investigations that could come from public release.\u201d Representatives for Nunes and Texas Republican Mike Conaway, who is helming the panel\u2019s Russia probe, did not respond to inquiries. The FBI declined to comment. Named in the memorandum are recent targets of Trump and the House Republicans, as The Daily Beast first reported: Rosenstein; FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe; and James Comey, the FBI director Trump fired over the Russia inquiry. The Republicans\u2019 declassification efforts come while Mueller is seeking to interview Trump about firing Comey, the Washington Post reported, though it is unclear if the president\u2019s legal team will assent. \u00a0The New York Times reported that the memo blames Rosenstein for seeking renewal of an already-authorized surveillance warrant against Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page. McCabe has been a target of Trump\u2019s ire since it emerged that his wife received financial contributions for an unsuccessful Virginia state Senate bid as a Democrat from Terry McAuliffe, then the Virginia governor and a close ally of the Clintons, before McCabe oversaw the Hillary Clinton private-email-server investigation. Hours before the House committee meeting, McCabe stepped down from his FBI responsibilities, something long forecasted in preparation for his long-scheduled retirement, but occurring as McCabe is in the center of a political storm. Axios reported that Wray refused to fire McCabe at Trump\u2019s behest\u2014even threatening to quit. It is an extraordinary fight for the House Republicans on the panel to wage. The House intelligence committee typically gives the prerogatives of the intelligence agencies a wide berth\u2014particularly over securing classified information, and especially over the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which governs the highly sensitive processes for investigating possible U.S.-based spies.

They are expected to seek declassification of that memo during the Monday afternoon hearing as well, though it is unclear that they possess the votes to do so, or have themselves avoided the disclosure of surveillance information should they prevail.Even if the House intelligence committee votes to declassify the Nunes memo, the process will take at least several days to result in the memo\u2019s release.

Chris Coons (D-DE) said.\nCoons, one of the chief architects of a bipartisan bill that would institute judicial review for any attempt to fire a special counsel, said he plans to \u201cspeak individually with as many of my colleagues as possible to build support for this effort.\u201d\nBut the new push comes as many Democrats have already resigned themselves to the fact that despite Trump\u2019s and his lawyer\u2019s most recent attacks on the special counsel\u2019s investigation, which have escalated the months-long effort to discredit the probe from the president and his allies in the media, Republicans and their leaders on Capitol Hill aren\u2019t on board with a legislative response\u2014prompting some to look for other avenues to preserve Mueller\u2019s investigation.\nAside from legislation, lawmakers have begun discussing joint letters or floor speeches as a way to \u201csend a strong signal\u201d to Trump.\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that we can make progress on that bill,\u201d Coons told The Daily Beast. \u201cI just had a number of conversations on the floor, and I think there are several senators in both parties who are looking for ways to convey to the president how seriously we take the threats to the special counsel.\u201d\nDemocrats\u2019 frustrations with the lack of progress on legislation come as Republicans remain unconvinced that Trump would actually move to thwart or end Mueller\u2019s investigation\u2014despite heightened attacks on the probe, which is looking into Russian election meddling and possible Trump-Russia collusion. They\u2019ve relied instead on the White House\u2019s insistence that Trump is not considering taking such action, and some have cited conversations with the president or his staff to conclude that Mueller isn\u2019t in any real danger.\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about it at all,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) said. \u201cI think it\u2019d be a big mistake and I think that\u2019s the kind of advice he\u2019s getting from everybody. \u2026 The consequences would be so overwhelming that it\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201d\nThe president and his legal team continued over the weekend to toughen their posture toward the special counsel\u2019s investigation. On Saturday, John Dowd, a lawyer on the president\u2019s team, told The Daily Beast that the probe should be shut down. While Dowd later said he was speaking only for himself, Trump followed suit in a series of tweets later that same day \u00a0attacking the integrity of the probe. And on Monday, Trump\u2019s legal team brought on Joseph diGenova, who has pushed a conspiracy theory about the president being \u201cframed\u201d by the FBI and the Justice Department.\nIn January, Coons\u2019 Republican counterpart, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), appeared to back off his own legislation to protect Mueller\u2019s probe. Daniel Keylin, a spokesman for the senator, told The Daily Beast at the time that \u201cthe president and his administration have spoken favorably of Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s professionalism and integrity,\u201d and that talk of firing Mueller \u201chas completely come to a halt.\u201d\nOn Monday, Tillis joined the Republican chorus of support for Mueller\u2019s investigation after Trump\u2019s Tweets deeming it a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d that \u201cshould never have been started.\u201d But Tillis said that there wasn\u2019t an \u201cimminent need\u201d to pass his legislation \u201ctoday or this week,\u201d as some lawmakers have floated the possibility of adding special counsel protection language to the massive spending bill Congress is considering this week. Eventually, Tillis said, the legislation should move forward \u201cas a matter of good governance.\u201d\nMany of his Republican colleagues disagree. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who co-authored a separate piece of legislation with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) aimed at protecting Mueller, has also backed away from his own bill in recent months, saying he remains confident that Trump wouldn\u2019t move against the special counsel.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

That\u2019s exactly what they did with Ken Starr,\u201d Graham said on Monday, referring to the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton. \u201cDemocrats went after Ken Starr saying it\u2019s a witch hunt. Nobody talked about firing Ken Starr. And unless there\u2019s some reason to fire Mueller, that's not going to happen. And I don\u2019t see a reason\u2014but you can expect Trump and other folks to go after Mueller. Democrats went after Ken Starr.\u201d\nWhen asked why he introduced legislation in the first place, Graham responded: \u201cJust to let people know where I stand.\u201d\nEven some of the president\u2019s most hardened critics aren\u2019t on board with a legislative response. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) said he has constitutional concerns with the two bills being considered, but thinks Republican leadership should preemptively speak out against a Mueller firing more forcefully than they have in the past.\n\u201cSome of us have spoken out. Everybody needs to\u2014strongly. I would hope that our leadership would come out and say this is a red line you can\u2019t go past,\u201d Flake said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to pick a fight, this is a fight to pick. You\u2019ve got to pick this fight. If you don\u2019t pick this fight, we might as well not be here. This is a serious one.\u201d\nA few Republican lawmakers did speak out more aggressively in the aftermath of the White House offensive this weekend, with Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) saying: \u201cIf you have an innocent client, Mr. Dowd, act like it.\u201d Others echoed Gowdy, arguing that Trump shouldn\u2019t attack the investigation if he truly believes he is innocent.\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that \u201cthe best thing for him as president\u2014since after almost one year there\u2019s been no show of collusion\u2014it seems to me like he\u2019s coming out looking pretty good at this point and that he ought to just let it play out.\u201d\nGrassley\u2019s panel has been working for months to reconcile the two bills intended to protect Mueller\u2019s probe into one, but that effort appears stalled.", "link": null, "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Noah Shachtman", "body": "Rex Tillerson was not a Middle Eastern dictator. But the American diplomats he used to lead are practically shooting off celebratory gunfire now that his statue has been toppled from Donald Trump\u2019s Washington. \n\u201cOn Tillerson: hallelujah!\u201d one State Department official said. \nState Department staffers who talked to The Daily Beast described the secretary of state\u2019s downfall as a liberation \u2013 even as they grimly recognized that recent history, literal and metaphorical, suggests that what follows liberation is chaos and occupation. \nWhile career State Department officials have a highly difficult relationship with the president, whose approaches on everything from refugees to Russia to race relations have prompted a wave of diplomatic departures, they are in lockstep with Trump over hating Tillerson \u2013 though for much different reasons. Trump\u2019s relationship with Tillerson, sources tell The Daily Beast, was further damaged after Tillerson distanced himself from Trump\u2019s public sympathies with the violent white supremacists parading through Charlottesville last August.\n\n\u201cPeople had sort of thought that Trump had just forgotten about firing Tillerson.\u201d\n\u2014 State Department official\n\nWhatever reputation for understatedness diplomats possess went out the door throughout Tillerson\u2019s calamitous State Department tenure. State Department officials were horrified by what they perceived as his disdain for them. His reforms left many experienced diplomats internally marginalized \u2013 with little to do but vent to reporters about Tillerson presiding over a decline of American diplomacy that many felt was the entire point of his tenure. \nTillerson was widely loathed for his deep budget cuts; an institutional realignment that many diplomats felt came at their expense; and an inner circle that longtime officials considered to hoard information to the point of insulating Tillerson from the concerns they had about the direction of U.S. foreign policy. \nAs news of Tillerson\u2019s ouster spread on Tuesday morning\u2014as Tillerson was supposed to be wrapping up a weeklong trip to five African countries\u2014diplomats who talked to The Daily Beast whipsawed between euphoria at his departure and fear about their likely new boss, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, emboldening Trump\u2019s ignorance, bellicosity and impulsiveness. \n\u201cTillerson kept a lot of the crazy in check and was obviously a moderating voice. But he never had the ear of [Trump], had a bad relationship with [national security adviser H.R.] McMaster and was a horrendous manager,\u201d said a second current State Department official.\nThe first State Department official said that Foggy Bottom should \u201cbuckle up\u201d for its incoming chief, Pompeo. \n\u201cWhile Pompeo gives reason for pause, one can have reasonable confidence he won\u2019t sideline the expertise of the building in favor of a handful of ill-equipped \u2018advisers\u2019 with limited experience and a disdain for career professionals,\u201d this official continued.\n\n\u201cPompeo will have the president\u2019s trust but enable his worst foreign policy instincts. Sanity has never been the guiding principle of this White House.\u201d\n\u2014 State Department official\n\nThat diplomat\u2019s confidence is going to come under pressure in the very near future. Pompeo has Trump\u2019s confidence, and is also one of the administration\u2019s leading hawks. While at the CIA, Pompeo acquired a quick reputation for distorting internal analysis to favor Trump and his predilections. In October, Pompeo publicly stated that Russian interference in the 2016 election \u2013 which the CIA has assessed occurred despite Trump\u2019s denials \u2013 \u00a0\u201cdid not affect the outcome,\u201d a conclusion the agency never in fact reached and about which it remains agnostic. \n\u201cPompeo will have the president\u2019s trust but enable his worst foreign policy instincts. Sanity has never been the guiding principle of this White House,\u201d the second diplomat said.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nA different State Department official said there was internal speculation that Pompeo would bring aboard a senior official at the State adjunct USAID, Jim Richardson, who was \u201cnot well liked.\u201d In a brazen move in January, Richardson had suspended all USAID cooperation with Tillerson and Ciccone\u2019s redesign out of concern for the future of the agency. While many inside State also disagree with the redesign, Richardson was \u201crepeatedly pissing off\u201d department officials with what some saw as a budgetary grab that would undermine the secretary of state\u2019s influence. But Richardson used to serve as Pompeo\u2019s chief of staff, prompting early speculation that Pompeo would elevate him to the seventh floor of Foggy Bottom.\nIronically for a career oilman who received an order of friendship from Vladimir Putin, Tillerson had become far more outspoken about Russian interference in the election than his former boss. In an internal December forum at Foggy Bottom, which quickly leaked to The Daily Beast, Tillerson referred openly to Moscow as having \u201cinterfered in democratic processes here.\u201d Tillerson\u2019s final statement as secretary of state, issued Monday night after UK Prime Minister Theresa May blamed Putin for the London assassination of a former Russian spy, accused Russia of being an \u201cirresponsible force of instability in the world, acting with open disregard for the sovereignty of other states and the life of their citizens.\u201d \nPutin said jokingly last September he had come to regret giving Tillerson the award.\nTillerson has been all but persona non grata with Trump ever since reportedly calling the president a \u201cfucking moron\u201d and then pointedly declining to personally deny saying it. But even some at State were somewhat empathetic toward Tillerson for the disrespect Trump returned by firing him while Tillerson was on foreign travel, and just weeks after Tillerson\u2019s father passed away.\nThat disrespect had become the norm for the Trump-Tillerson relationship. For months, Trump practically delighted in shutting down Tillerson in public. After Tillerson made a public overture to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, offering to \u201ctalk about the weather\u201d during a December speech, the White House put out a statement saying its hardline position on North Korea was unaffected. Then this month, Trump stunned the world by accepting an overture from Kim for direct leader-to-leader talks \u2013 which cut Tillerson out and contradicted the secretary\u2019s attempts to row back toward Trump\u2019s position. (\u201cNorth Korea must earn its way back to the table,\u201d Tillerson had said three days after his upbraiding.) \nIt was only one example of Trump gelding a secretary he had personally plucked from the leadership of ExxonMobil. Like an autocrat, Trump had given his son-in-law Jared Kushner a wide foreign-policy portfolio, with substantial and personal influence over critical relationships with Israel and Saudi Arabia. Tillerson\u2019s first trip to Iraq as secretary, where the U.S. was engaged in a shooting war with the Islamic State, occurred in October; Kushner visited in April. In June, Trump defended a blockade of Qatar by other U.S. Gulf partners that Tillerson had sought to end. \u00a0\n\n\u201cAfter Tillerson's Charlottesville comment, there was an effort on the part of White House officials to cut State officials out of meetings. The \u2018cold shoulder got a bit colder,\u2019 the current official said.\u201d\n\nBut in retrospect, according to knowledgeable current and former officials, the Trump-Tillerson relationship was doomed, in part, by the president\u2019s infamous Charlottesville equivalency between anti-racist protesters and the violent white supremacists Trump said included \u201cvery fine people.\u201d\nTillerson was livid, and considered resigning, according to one former senior State Department official. Instead, the ordinarily taciturn, press-averse Tillerson agreed to appear on the Sunday shows\u2014where he tacitly condemned Trump\u2019s remarks. \u201cThe president speaks for himself,\u201d he told Fox News Sunday.\nTrump and White House officials fumed over Tillerson\u2019s refusal to stick up for the president, according to multiple administration sources, and helped cement his reputation in the West Wing as, at the very least, not somebody who could be counted on as a \u201cteam player,\u201d one West Wing official noted.\n\u201cIt was a shot across the bow. The first time publicly that he had broken with the president. It shook the White House. Everybody watched that and knew exactly what he was saying,\u201d added the former State Department official.\nAfter Tillerson's Charlottesville comment, there was an effort on the part of White House officials to cut State officials out of meetings, according to a current and a former senior Trump administration official. Since the dawn of the Trump era, Tillerson's State Department had already been sidelined in various ways and, post-Charlottesville, the \u201ccold shoulder got a bit colder,\u201d the current official said.\nState Department officials began to find themselves left out of key inter-agency conversations. Staffers who left State to join other, smaller agencies found themselves with better White House access than they had before.\nThat explains some of the relief expressed by current and former Foggy Bottom staffers. But even those happy to see Tillerson go couldn\u2019t help but note how badly this would scar him. \n\u201cThis is the last thing he [Tillerson] wanted,\u201d the former State Department official said. \u201cHe wanted to go a long time ago himself. He didn\u2019t know why he wanted this job. He realized very quickly he was not the right fit. You can tell.\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t leave last summer is to prevent this,\u201d the former official added. \u201cHe wanted to control his own exit. He was so hellbent on protecting his legacy that he wanted to control his own exit. Because of the pride.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are hated inside State and by the White House, almost universally seen as incompetent.\u201d\n\u2014 State Department official\n\nTillerson loyalists ensured that their boss did not leave without inflicting harm on Trump in return. On Tuesday morning, Undersecretary Steve Goldstein said on the record that Tillerson \u201chad every intention of remaining\u201d in office and \u201cdid not speak to the president this morning and is unaware of the reason\u201d for his firing. Within hours, the Associated Press reported, Goldstein was fired.\nTillerson, in an impromptu, eight-minute farewell statement at Foggy Bottom, took subliminal shot after subliminal shot at Trump. His voice catching, he did not even pretend to thank Trump for the opportunity to serve as secretary, instead thanking \u201call of you\u201d in the American public. \nIn remarks formally aimed at the diplomats who loathe him, Tillerson said the world needs \u201cselfless leaders like these\u201d and people who treat \u201ceach other with honesty and integrity\u201d at the helm of the country. He repeatedly praised the importance of traditional allies and partners,\u201d leaving unsaid Trump\u2019s disrespect for them. He warned Russia\u2019s \u201ccurrent trajectory\u201d would lead to its \u201cfurther isolation\u201d and sought a relationship with China \u201cfree of conflict,\u201d remarks at odds with both Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for a trade war with Beijing and the National Security Strategy, authored by national security adviser H.R. McMaster, that considers both countries adversaries. Tillerson praised Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford, the military broadly\u2014but not McMaster.\nOfficials at State were hoping that Tillerson\u2019s inner circle, particularly powerful chief of staff Margaret Peterlin, senior policy adviser Brian Hook and Christine Ciccone, who has running an internally-despised departmental \u201credesign,\u201d were next to depart. Peterlin in particular is said by multiple sources to have a rocky relationship with McMaster, as did Tillerson. \n\u201cThey are hated inside State and by the White House, almost universally seen as incompetent,\u201d the first State Department official said. \nThough Trump cultivated a reality-show reputation as a decisive boss, Trump chafes at the idea of firing people in person and prefers they simply solve personnel problems for him without confrontation. Tillerson apparently learned about his firing from a presidential tweet. \n\u201cRex is a very good man, I like Rex a lot, I really appreciate his commitment and his service, and I\u2019ll be speaking to Rex over a long period of time,\u201d Trump said on Tuesday.\nAccording to two sources who\u2019ve spoken with Trump in recent weeks about Tillerson, the president would privately knock the intelligence and acumen of his own top diplomat, and vent about what Trump and senior White House staff would often see as Tillerson\u2019s tendency to speak for the country on the international stage\u2014in essence, upstaging the president. Trump would express bitterness at what he interpreted as Tillerson \u201cthink[ing] he knew better\u201d than the president on foreign policy and high-stakes negotiations, including on North Korea and the Iran nuclear deal. \n\n\u201cThis is the last thing he [Tillerson] wanted... He wanted to control his own exit. He was so hellbent on protecting his legacy that he wanted to control his own exit. Because of the pride.\u201d\n\u2014 former State Department official\n\nThe Daily Beast reported in October that several senior Trump aides were actively hoping Tillerson would resign late last year after word of the \u201cfucking moron\u201d quote broke. \u201cPeople in [the White House] who are loyal to the president think Rex Tillerson hates [Trump],\u201d one White House official told The Daily Beast at the time.\nEven as Tillerson\u2019s ouster has been rumored for months, leaks about it had recently abated and many at the State Department were taken by surprise. Several diplomats did not even know their boss was out until reporters called them. As of 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, the State Department had issued no internal guidance, another State Department source told The Daily Beast. \n\u201cPeople had sort of thought that Trump had just forgotten about firing him,\u201d the source said.\n\u2014with additional reporting by Sam Stein", "link": null, "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Barrett Holmes", "body": "In an act of retribution against Delta Air Lines\u2019 decision last Friday to stop providing discounts to NRA members, Georgia\u2019s state legislature on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly to pass a bill that stripped away a $50 million sales-tax exemption on jet fuel. Delta is far and away the biggest airline in the state so it would have been the main beneficiary of the exemption. \nPolitical revenge and attacking major businesses has now become the modus operandi of the supposedly pro-business GOP, and Georgians should be appalled at the lengths their political leaders will go to defend the NRA.\nI was born and raised in Georgia and it is difficult to exaggerate the significance of Delta in the state. Atlanta has been Delta\u2019s headquarters since 1941, and the airline just signed a 20-year extension to its lease at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. That would make nearly a century of Delta calling Atlanta home.\nDelta is also Georgia\u2019s #1 private employer with 33,000 employees, and Delta is directly responsible for $43.5 billion in economic impact in the state each year. When it started it was a little regional airline. By the 1980s it was a titan, flying all over the world. If you live in and move around Atlanta, it is impossible to not know someone employed by Delta, and as a kid growing up in the Atlanta suburbs I had plenty of friends whose parents worked for Delta.\nAlso, I\u2019m a kid of the 80s and 90s. This era was defined by a celebration of Atlanta\u2019s diversity and a city-wide commitment to turning Atlanta into a city with global influence. Ted Turner created CNN in the 80s, and the network\u2019s coverage of the first Iraq War in the early 90s made Atlanta the headquarters of world cable news at the time. The Braves won the World Series in 1995, and the Olympics came to town in 1996--a staggering achievement for a Southern American city, which not so long before, historically speaking, was an apartheid city.\n\n\u201cGeorgia\u2019s Republicans have no desire to serve the public and only care about sustaining their privilege.\u201d\n\nThis was a magical time in Atlanta, and Delta was right there. Atlanta had long been Delta\u2019s primary hub, and as the city grew, so did our airport, and so did Delta. By 1998, Hartsfield-Jackson had become the busiest airport in the world, and Delta had become emblematic of Atlanta\u2019s global reach and ambitions. No corporation, not even Coca Cola, based in the city since its 1886 inception, so symbolized Atlanta's cosmopolitan progress.\nAnd now, despite Delta\u2019s transformational impact on the state, Georgia\u2019s Republican legislators have chosen the NRA over the airline. They chose guns and white privilege over economic growth and international prestige. The NRA\u2019s mostly white members and the conservatives who support them see discounts, partnerships, and privilege as an essential component of their way of life, regardless of the impact of their actions or the toxicity of their beliefs. This can\u2019t be overlooked.\nThis sordid affair began on Monday when Georgia\u2019s Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle tweeted, \u201cI will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA. Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back.\u201d\nConsidering the high volume of outlandish tweets that regularly come from the White House and the GOP, many did not think much of Cagle\u2019s bravado at first. Most questioned the legal implications of his statement and wondered if it was a violation of the First Amendment or simply blatant corruption.\nBut with the short-sighted, hypocritical determination that remains particular to today\u2019s GOP, Cagle convinced the Republican-controlled legislature to remove the sales-tax exemption on jet fuel from their previously approved tax bill. Georgia\u2019s Republican Governor Nathan Deal says that he will sign the bill, despite being frustrated by the \u201cantics\u201d of his fellow Republicans.\nDeal isn\u2019t the only person frustrated by the \u201cantics\u201d of the Republican Party, but Americans can ill afford to enable the GOP and their dangerous pro-gun, NRA supporting agenda.\nFollowing the Parkland, Fla. shooting, \u00a0over a dozen businesses have severed ties \u00a0with the NRA or implemented restrictions on gun purchases. Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods has stopped selling the assault-style rifles including the AR-15 used in the massacre. Walmart has also raised the age limit to purchase a gun or ammunition to 21. United Airlines also followed Delta\u2019s lead and stopped providing NRA members with discounts. But Cagle didn\u2019t attack United or any of the other companies that have changed course following the Parkland shooting.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nCagle\u2019s attack on Delta was clearly a petty, personal political attack against a major Atlanta business, and it speaks to a type of corruption and systemic white privilege that has largely become re-normalized in America. \nCagle is furious that the NRA will no longer receive special treatment from Delta. Delta has not said that it will deny services to the NRA, create specific NRA member sections at the back of the plane, or invoke its corporate religious beliefs to treat NRA members as second-class citizens. Delta has merely ended its affiliation with another company while remaining neutral on the issue of gun rights.\nAfter Delta\u2019s decision to remove a sliver of privilege from the NRA, Cagle responded by saying that \u201cdiscrimination against law-abiding gun owners will not solve the problem.\u201d\nNote: For Cagle and the rest of Georgia\u2019s Republican Party, a loss of privilege \u2014 even on something as minor as group discounts on airfare \u2014 equates to discrimination. As an African American who grew up in South, I\u2019ve regularly encountered white Southerners who rail against a loss of privilege as an attack on their freedoms. The prioritization of whiteness, the expectation of favors, or a quid pro quo amongst business elites, who almost always are white, has become the expected norm of society.\nThis standard consumes the entire region and infects all walks of life, even those situations that are not overtly racist. It creates a coterie of political and business elites more consumed with sustaining their power and privilege than serving the public\u2019s interests.\nDelta broke this unspoken rule, and it is now being punished for it to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. Georgia\u2019s Republicans could not care less about gun control and would rather spend time attacking a company that supports 33,000 jobs and generates billions of dollars in revenue each year.\nGeorgia\u2019s Republicans have no desire to serve the public and only care about sustaining their privilege. As a Georgian, I doubt that Delta will leave the state anytime soon. It is almost unimaginable, and the economic impact would be devastating. But if Georgia\u2019s conservatives continue to attack it and undermine Delta\u2019s business in defense of white privilege I would not begrudge Delta leaving.

At that time, he was chairman of Russia\u2019s legislature, the Duma. He was appointed head of the SVR in September 2016. In January 2017, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a report saying it had \u201chigh confidence\u201d that Russian security services interfered in the 2016 presidential election. In particular, it singled out Russia\u2019s military intelligence service, the GRU, which works closely with the SVR, as a main instigator of operations against the U.S. While Pompeo has in the past acknowledged cooperating with Russia on counterterrorism operations, the CIA director told the BBC this week that he anticipates Moscow will continue to interfere in U.S. elections.\u201cI have every expectation that they will continue to try and do that, but I'm confident that America will be able to have a free and fair election [and] that we will push back in a way that is sufficiently robust that the impact they have on our election won't be great,\u201d Pompeo said.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/russias-sanctioned-spy-chief-reportedly-met-cia-director-in-the-us?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Scott Bixby", "body": "A little more than three weeks after his inauguration, Donald Trump gave his first-ever press conference as president. Over the course of 77 dizzying minutes, Trump told journalists hastily corralled into the East Room that Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was \u201cfake news,\u201d asked an African-American reporter whether she was friends with the Congressional Black Congress, and declared that members of the media who printed leaks from within his own White House should be \u201cashamed of themselves.\u201dOne year later, that circus-like exchange remains Trump\u2019s first, last, and only formal press conference\u2014the longest period of time without a solo press conference held by an American president in at least half a century.According to records stretching back to the Coolidge administration and compiled by the American Presidency Project, Trump has gone longer without conducting a formal solo press conference than any president since at least Lyndon Johnson. By the end of his first year in office, President Barack Obama had held 11 solo press conferences; President George W. Bush had held five.Asked whether Trump plans to hold press conferences in the near future, or ever, the White House disputed the notion that the president\u2019s historic scarcity of traditional press availability indicated a scarcity of overall press availability.\u201cThe president and his administration have been one of the accessible administrations,\u201d White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters told The Daily Beast. \u201cThe president frequently holds impromptu gaggles, takes questions from the pool and engages daily with the American people.\u201dTrump has indeed answered questions from members of the press in other settings, primarily in informal gaggles with the White House press pool\u2014a rotating group of correspondents who document the president\u2019s daily movements and occasionally get locked in rooms with plastic bags covering the windows while he golfs. On some occasions, the president will spontaneously answer a shouted question as he boards Marine One, or even turn chance encounters with the press pool into miniature pressers.The president has also appeared in 22 \u201ctwo-and-two\u201d joint press conferences with other world leaders, in which each official calls on two reporters of their choosing\u2014roughly in line with the number of such such conferences by his recent predecessors.Trump frequently uses the two-and-two format to allow questions from friendlier outlets. His tendency to grant the first question to Fox News\u2019 John Roberts is a running joke in the press corps: During a September 2017 question-and-answer session alongside the emir of Kuwait, Trump withdrew a question from Roberts by saying, \u201cActually, we\u2019ll go to somebody else this time, John. You\u2019ve been doing enough.\u201dBut Trump\u2019s fitful engagements with the press\u2014seemingly random, often rushed, and held entirely on his own terms\u2014represent a departure from the relationship past presidents had with the people assigned to cover the White House.\u201cThere\u2019s value in those nontraditional exchanges,\u201d Margaret Talev, White House correspondent for Bloomberg and president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, told The Daily Beast. \u201cBut we also really encourage this president, and any American president, to hold open, normal news conferences, because they are of real value to the American public.\u201dThe president\u2019s hesitance to engage directly with members of the press outside informal gaggles is a shift in communications strategy from his freewheeling presidential campaign, when Trump was refreshingly available and candid with the press. Trump even sent fundraising emails blasting Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton as \u201cHIDING HILLARY\u201d for going 278 days without conducting a formal press conference.Thank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

In fact, the president has gone as far as to express doubts to aides and friends about the assault allegations, and has asked repeatedly if there are any reasons Porter\u2019s two ex-wives could have to make up such claims, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the conversations.Trump\u2019s skepticism has been apparent in discussions with confidants and officials, who tell The Daily Beast that, at least in their conversations, he has not expressed sympathy for the ex-wives, Colbie Holderness and Jennifer Willoughby, who have gone on the record to allege physical violence.\u201c[It is] 100% not what's on his mind,\u201d one source close to Trump who has spoken with the president in recent days told The Daily Beast, referring to the well-being of alleged victims. The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment on this story.Trump has, however, made clear his displeasure with how his own staff has handled the Porter scandal, multiple sources tell The Daily Beast. Among those whom the president believes have done a less-than-adequate job include Communications Director Hope Hicks, who is dating Porter, and Chief of Staff John Kelly. According to a Friday report from ABC News, the latter told Trump he would resign over his handling of the Porter scandal if the president asked him to. The White House denies that Kelly \u201coffered\u201d his resignation. In particular, sources say, Trump has mused about how awful media coverage has been lately on Porter and the White House, and \u201chow terrible\u201d it appeared that the administration had\u2014in a jarringly uncharacteristic move from Trump-world\u2014copped to an error in its handling of the matter.For the president, it was a reversion to the mean: his knee-jerk impulse to defend those loyal to him crashing against the efforts by his team to manage the situation. Trump has dispensed with self-reflection and self-doubt before when it comes to standing by political allies and those close to him. Among those who he has defended against accusations of sexual harassment or assault include failed Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, the late Fox News architect Roger Ailes, and former heavyweight champ Mike Tyson. (The president himself has been accused by numerous women of sexual misconduct. The official position of the White House is that all the women are liars.)Even Trump\u2019s defenders find it tough to, well, defend. \u201cI\u2019m a supporter of the president but I\u2019m not a surrogate of the president here,\u201d said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump aide who has remained publicly supportive of the president, when asked of Trump\u2019s history of being persuaded by mens\u2019 denials. \u201cThat\u2019s his issue not mine.\u201dThose close to Trump say that he is monomaniacally committed to never admitting fault, which extends to those questioning the quality of his hires. In his comments on Friday, Trump heaped personal and professional praise upon Porter. \"We certainly wish him well. It's obviously a very tough time for him. He did a very good job while he was in the White House,\u201d the president gushed. \u201cWe hope that he will have a wonderful career.\u201dThe statement represented a staggering shift in White House strategy which had evolved from an initial, strident defense of Porter early this week, to disappointment but acceptance in his resignation, to disowning him entirely. On Thursday evening, the White House provided The Daily Beast a brief statement on the condition of anonymity, in which it stressed that officials felt \u201dmisled by Mr. Porter\u2019s characterization of the [then-]impending allegations from his ex-wives.\u201dIn failing to follow his own White House team\u2019s spin Trump was, aides and friends say, attempting to address his concerns that the scandal had, to that point, made him and his administration look bad. But instead of fixing matters, the president raised additional questions about his capacity to run the White House and the acumen of the team he has surrounded himself with. \u201cI think it is shocking that Hope Hicks still has a job,\u201d said Katie Packer Beeson, the deputy campaign manager for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign. \u201cAt the outset, she should have said, \u2018I'm conflicted. [Press Secretary] Sarah [Sanders] you need to handle this.\u2019 She didn't.

U-S-A!\u201d\u2014is important for only one reason. In an otherwise unmemorable night, it is a window into how Trump\u2019s presidency is going to unfold in the coming months: with the slavish defense, indeed, devotion of his party. What was a hostile takeover of the GOP by an outsider is now a merger,\u00a0accepted by a group with a serious case of Stockholm Syndrome. Trump can insult the old GOP, threaten to primary them, libel and tweet-shame them and all that has gone to show that they need him more than he needs them. The normalization of Trump started with the tax bill. When Trump made GOP dreams of permanent tax cuts for the wealthy camouflaged by small and temporary ones for the middle class come true, it\u2019s hard to exaggerate the gratitude they felt. When Sen. Orrin Hatch called him perhaps the \u201cbest president\u201d ever in the Rose Garden celebration, he was reflecting the prevailing sentiment. That the individual mandate of Obamacare was destroyed in the process was icing on the cake. With that, they went from questioning his leadership ability and even his mental stability to a willingness to side with him in undermining the country\u2019s most sacred institutions if that what it takes to save him, and therefore, them. The newfound devotion is crucial given the rough times ahead. Nothing Trump tweets or does\u2014getting funding for a smart, or dumb, wall; becoming consoler-in-chief after a national tragedy as he hinted at a pre-SOTU lunch for TV anchors\u2014will divert attention from the Trump vs. Mueller drama that\u2019s coming to a theater near you. In one form or another Trump is going to have to appear before Mueller where honesty is the best policy under penalty of perjury. At least one son and one son-in-law are witnesses if not targets. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn is testifying reluctantly and former chief strategist Steve Bannon seems happy to sing like a bird if executive privilege doesn\u2019t interfere. Just a cursory look at Trump\u2019s own words and tweets shows obstruction of justice. This is where supine Republicans come in to undermine the investigation and investigators so as to subvert the rule of law. With Republicans falling in line if not in love, the party of Lincoln is teed up to defend him no matter what as they go about trashing the FBI and Justice Department they used to honor. The trash talk is also coming from key officials like Gen. John Kelly, the sainted chief of staff, who hasn\u2019t brought Trump up to his level but been reduced to that of Trump. Kelly has joined in the effort to find fault with\u2014and the time to directly pressure\u2014law enforcement officials connected to the Russian inquiry. It\u2019s not clear exactly how Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, married to a \u201closer,\u201d was railroaded into early retirement but Director Christopher Wray let it be known that McCabe left just ahead of an Inspector General\u2019s report critical of his handling of Hilary Clinton\u2019s emails. The latest moves to protect Trump is playing out with the full backing of Speaker Paul Ryan. He\u2019s in favor of the House intelligence committee chair, Rep. Devin Nunes, publishing classified material cherry-picked to supposedly show that the Justice Department improperly obtained a surveillance order for Carter Page, a former Trump campaign associate and a hapless mark of Russian operatives. And Ryan is fine with Nunes not releasing the full file which would show that this didn\u2019t happen. There was a time not so long-ago when Paul Ryan called out and demoted Nunes for his clownish nighttime caper to the White House to pick up and then re-deliver so-called secret documents heralded as giving credence to Trump\u2019s lunatic claim that former president Barack Obama wiretapped him. The documents did no such thing. But that demotion of Trump\u2019s water-carrier came before Ryan had a beloved tax cut for the GOP donor class in hand. Now Republicans see a soaring stock market, a booming economy, a becalmed international set at Davos, a complicit evangelical base, and think that the midterms might not be such a challenge if they can just stabilize the ship of state. Trump asks Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein if he\u2019s on his team and Republicans are undisturbed. Trump says on a hot mic that he\u2019s \u201c100% \u201c going to release the Nunes memo when the White House said hours earlier he hadn\u2019t even read it, and his party moves ahead with it at the risk of revealing sources and methods.Even as they stood and gustily cheered, what a tall order it must be to embrace Trump in what\u2019s being called a slow-motion Saturday Night Massacre. Even though Twitter Trump stayed home with a cheeseburger and Fox News while Teleprompter Trump came to Capitol Hill, they had to overlook a president willing to alter reality in the well of the House and never once smile. He strutted, mugged, and applauded for himself, chin jutting and eyes squinting, the most joyless president in modern history. Still I have a $50 hamburger at the Trump Hotel for anyone who spotted a Republican who didn\u2019t clap on cue. What they\u2019ve forgotten is that Trump is an anomaly who can be easily made unhappy but never made happy. Sell your soul to placate him today\u2014I\u2019m thinking of you, Gen. Kelly\u2014and tomorrow you may still find yourself cashiered. Just ask Attorney General Jeff Sessions how that works. Someday the Grand Old Party may see that by normalizing Trump they\u2019ve violated every traditional and constitutional norm. If that\u2019s the price of power, for now they are willing to pay it.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-gops-sad-stockholm-syndrome?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Marlow Stern", "body": "The Mooch is back. Why is anyone\u2019s guess.Fresh off a wacky, expletive-laden interview with Vanity Fair, former Trump White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who was canned after just eleven days on the job when he accused then-chief strategist Steve Bannon of autofellatio in a no-holds-barred interview with the New Yorker, made a Friday night stop on Real Time with Bill Maher. Things got off to a very rocky start\u2014an expected outcome, given how Mooch was flanked by Maher, anti-Trump conservative David Frum, and ex-interim DNC chairperson Donna Brazile, and that the Mooch\u2019s political career has been defined by crass opportunism, with the former Hillary and Obama backer supporting first Scott Walker, then reaching out to Marco Rubio, and then endorsing Jeb Bush before finally joining the Trump campaign in 2016 (despite branding Trump \u201canti-American\u201d and a \u201chack politician\u201d just one year prior).\u00a0 Early on, Scaramucci defended the Trump tax cuts, leaving Maher beside himself. \u201cAnthony, where is most of the money going? Where\u2019s most of the money going?!\u201d the host pleaded, prompting Scaramucci to launch into a red herring-tale of the decline of the working class due to globalization. Enter David \u201cAxis of Evil\u201d Frum, senior editor of The Atlantic and former George W. Bush speechwriter. \u201cI have a question for you: before you went into government, where you served as communications advisor, you were given an enormous offer from a Chinese group for the purchase of your company for what, $90 million, before you went in. After you came out, the purchasers lost interest. How am I to understand that?\u201d he queried. Frum was referring to a conflict of interest that arose when Mooch took the White House gig: the pending sale of his investment firm Skybridge Capital, valued at between $200-230 million, to the shady Chinese firm HNA Capital, which has deep ties to the Chinese government. Mooch was himself expected to clear $77 million from the deal after taxes, though it never passed regulators. If you recall during the campaign, Mooch, in a hilarious self-own, called on the FBI and Justice Department to investigate the \u201cleak\u201d of his financial disclosure forms revealing his existing ties to Skybridge, despite them being a matter of public record. He later blamed the \u201cleak\u201d\u2014even though there was no leak, as the documents were given to an inquiring reporter by the Export-Import Bank\u2014on then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, causing a rift between Mooch and pals Priebus and Bannon. The Mooch, seething with anger, called Frum\u2019s accusation \u201ccompletely untrue and \u201cBS,\u201d telling him to \u201ccall the Treasury Department.\u201d Pursing his lips and flexing, The Mooch exuded an air of agitated calm throughout the HBO show\u2019s panel discussion, finding himself repeatedly on the receiving end of barbs courtesy of Frum, Brazile, and occasionally Maher. When Maher suggested that \u201cRussia helped\u201d Trump win the election, Scaramucci replied, \u201cYou\u2019re suggesting that [Trump] colluded with the Russians,\u201d which, no, that was not the suggestion. Mooch later admitted that he agrees with the assessment of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), which oversees all 17 U.S. federal intelligence agencies, that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election\u2014though appeared to ignore the part of the report stating: \u201cWe assess the [Russian] influence campaign aspired to help President-elect Trump\u2019s chances of victory when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to the President-elect.\u201d But it was Frum who clashed loudest and longest with Scaramucci, with the #NeverTrumper at one point charging that he was blinded by \u201cambition,\u201d which, true, and later saying, \u201cI\u2019ve spent more time in a Republican administration than you. As a Republican, does it not stick in your craw that Vladimir Putin wanted to help your guy so much? Don\u2019t you ask yourself the question, \u2018Why did my guy win the Putin primary?\u2019\u201dMooch brushed the question off, replying, \u201cYour level of anger and sanctimony is not coming across as great on television.\u201d Thank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

One or the other,\u201d referring to the beginning of Mooch\u2019s guest appearance where he indeed name-dropped Harvard several times. (The Mooch is also worth several hundred millions dollars.) It was Maher, of course, who got the last laugh. When pressed by the comedian as to how he\u2019d explain Trump\u2019s Access Hollywood tape to his child someday, Mooch unconvincingly replied, \u201cDepending on his age, I\u2019ll be very honest with \u2018em. I\u2019ll say, you know what, there\u2019s a lot of flawed people in the world.

For years, he has been the NRA\u2019s main man lobbying in Russia, with an outpost for his activities in Washington as well.\nOne of the guests at the Bunker 42 party, well-known political analyst Georgy Bovt, noticed that no other Russian officials were present, and, for what it\u2019s worth, he didn\u2019t get the impression the Americans were the kind of people who could establish a bridge between the political elites of the United States and Russia.\nTo somebody like Bovt, who has worked as a editor in chief for several magazines since the 1990s and seen the kind of shows the Kremlin will put on at a dinner, the spread looked pretty modest: just a few sandwiches and drinks. \n\u201cI could not see any sign of the Kremlin\u2019s hand behind that event,\u201d Bovt told The Daily Beast. \u201cThere were a few Americans who looked like ordinary pensioners discussing gun rights in the U.S. with members of a Russian shooting association, which, by the way, was closed down about a month ago.\u201d\nIn January, the McClatchy news service reported that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking closely at Torshin, who is also a former senator from President Vladimir Putin\u2019s United Russia party, amid allegations he may have funneled money into Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign through the NRA.\nThat story has come back into the news now in the aftermath of the Valentine\u2019s Day slaughter at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, as heartbroken, angry survivors have focused attention on the gun lobby\u2019s \u201cpuppet\u201d politicians, who block common-sense efforts to limit the raw firepower available over the counter. Add Moscow to that mix, and the atmosphere of conspiracy grows very dark indeed.\nBut was the Russia-Torshin-NRA connection a factor in the Trump election?\nU.S. intelligence agencies and at least one top White House official, national security adviser H.R. McMaster, say they have no doubt that Putin sought to influence the American elections and undermine their credibility, that the evidence is \u201cincontrovertible.\u201d \nEven Trump now concedes that point, while denying vehemently that his campaign colluded with the Russian operation or that they tipped the scales in his favor. Indeed, he insists, improbably, that others somehow benefited more from the Russian operation than he did.\nIn point of fact, Trump lost the popular vote by about 3 million ballots but won in the decisive Electoral College tally because of a total margin of roughly 100,000 votes\u2014or less\u2014in three swing states: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nIt is not unreasonable to think that many votes could have been swayed by the Russian operation and, perhaps, by Russian money.\nEarlier this month, special counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russians connected to the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg (PDF), an operation run by a close Putin ally, on eight counts. These ranged from \u201cimpairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of the Federal Election Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the U.S. Department of State\u201d to mail fraud and identity theft. \nThe 37-page indictment (PDF) says senior employees of the Internet Research Agency visited the U.S. under false pretenses in 2014 to gather intelligence on the upcoming elections, visiting several states, including Michigan, that might prove critical to the outcome. The IRA also subsequently was told by \u201cunwitting\u201d Trump activists to focus on \u201cpurple states\u201d that were in play. \n\n\u201cExperts on the disorganization of the Kremlin insist that the Torshin story is much more nuanced and perhaps less menacing than it appears in Washington, because the Kremlin\u2019s right wing often has no idea what the left wing is doing.\u201d\n\nIn Russia, where Putin\u2019s political opponents have quite enough of their own problems, it has become commonplace among independent analysts as well as Kremlin supporters to dismiss the whole \u201cRussia conspiracy\u201d as a paranoid American fantasy. And experts on the disorganization of the Kremlin insist that the Torshin story is much more nuanced and perhaps less menacing than it appears in Washington, because the Kremlin\u2019s right wing often has no idea what the left wing is doing.\nAs The New Yorker\u2019s Masha Gessen wrote after the Mueller indictments, \u201cLoyal Putinites and dissident intellectuals alike are remarkably united in finding the American obsession with Russian meddling to be ridiculous.\u201d\nHence Bovt\u2019s judgment about the crummy canap\u00e9s in Stalin\u2019s bunker.\nThat said, there is no question that NRA funds\u2014more than $30 million\u2014were a significant factor in support of Trump\u2019s candidacy, and even a small donation forming part of that would raise legal issues. It is unlawful to use foreign money to influence federal elections. \nIf Torshin did give money to the NRA, tracing that through to legally actionable support for the Trump campaign could be extremely difficult. But Torshin\u2019s profile makes him seem a very colorful villain. Spanish investigators allege the Russian banker is a mafia godfather laundering money for Moscow\u2019s infamous Taganskaya organized crime group through Spanish banks and real estate deals. \nIndeed, the Spanish newspaper of record, El Pa\u00eds, ran a lengthy report about Torshin almost a year ago.\nAccording to that article, phone taps indicated that Torshin outranked a local capo named Alexander Romanov (who has since been convicted on organized crime related charges). Romanov referred to Torshin as \u201cthe Godfather\u201d and \u201cthe boss.\u201d \nTorshin has denied the Spanish allegations, and, mocking the renewed accusations this week, he retweeted a picture of Al Pacino in The Godfather next to a quotation: \u201cThe rule for the reasonable ones is to go against the rules, when there is no other way to finish what you started.\u201d (Torshin, by the way, often tweets in English.) \nAccording to the police documents cited by the Spanish press, Torshin was supposed to go to the mobster Romanov\u2019s birthday party in Palma in 2013, and Spanish authorities were waiting to arrest him. But Torshin didn\u2019t turn up. \u201cA unit consisting of 12 officers was awaiting him at the airport and in a hotel, where he was expected to arrive accompanied by other people being investigated in a money-laundering ring,\u201d but they were left empty-handed.\nThe Spanish believe Torshin was tipped off.\nThen, in February of last year, it appears it was the new Trump administration that was tipped off about Torshin\u2019s shady connections. \nThrough his NRA ties, Torshin was invited to a prayer breakfast with the newly inaugurated President Donald Trump on Feb. 1 and was supposed to have a personal encounter before that started. \nBut according to the El Pa\u00eds article and a report by Michael Isikoff on Yahoo! News, who also collaborated on the El Pa\u00eds story, Torshin\u2019s invitation was canceled at the last minute because a senior White House staffer spotted his name on the guest list and said he had \u201cbaggage,\u201d meaning an alleged criminal background.\nWhatever Torshin\u2019s links to the Russian mob, he certainly makes no secret of his ties to the NRA. \nRussians have an interest in the organization, not least, because of the extensive sale of AK-47 assault rifles in the American market. Indeed, after the gun\u2019s inventor, Mikhail Kalashnikov, died in December 2013 at 94, Torshin published an obituary in The Washington Times. \nIn the last paragraph, Torshin mentioned that he \u201chad the pleasure of attending the National Rifle Association\u2019s annual meeting in Houston\u201d in 2013, noting that he and Kalashnikov had \u201cboth been \u2018life members\u2019 of the NRA for years.\u201d\nIn May 2016, Torshin confirmed to Russian reporters that he had been seated at the same table as Donald Trump Jr. at a private dinner during the NRA convention that same month in Louisville, Kentucky. \nBut in Moscow, the skepticism remains. \n\u201cI have known Torshin for a long time and I can say that he has never passed, never transferred any money to Trump\u2019s campaign. This is just a ridiculous thought,\u201d Yuri Krupnov, a pro-Kremlin political analyst, told The Daily Beast.\nIndeed, Torshin\u2019s critics in Russia regarded his meetings in the U.S. as a sign that he could not be trusted\u2014in Russia. In 2015 the professor and corruption fighter Alexander Fridom published articles about Torshin\u2019s cooperation with the NRA, \u201can organization that supported anti-Russian projects,\u201d calling for Russian authorities to investigate Torshin.\n\n\u201cMany believed that Torshin, a lifelong member of the NRA, was paid by American firearms producers, acting as their lobbyist.\u201d\n\u2014 Sergei Markov, member of parliament\n\nAt the time Torshin held a sensitive post as a member of the National Antiterrorist Committee.\n\u201cRussian modern history knows only two high-ranking officials having both full access to secret information in Russia and a political lobbying role abroad: former secretary of Security Council Boris Berezovsky and Senator Torshin,\u201d Fridom wrote.\nThe majority of Russians, more than 70 percent, do not support Torshin\u2019s idea of legalizing guns. They say there is more than enough violence on the streets\u2014police reports counted more than 9,000 murders in 2017. \n\u201cIf we legalize weapons, police would have to deal with people shooting each other to death on the buses and trains,\u201d Sergei Markov, a member of parliament, told The Daily Beast. The recent school shootings in the U.S. have inspired the Russian parliament to discuss a new bill that would oblige every owner of firearms to wear identification tags similar to the symbols on the uniforms of law enforcement officials.\nBanker Torshin would have to wear one, too. \nIn a rare interview on the television channel Moscow24, Torshin confessed: \u201cTo me, one kind of love is for firearms.\u201d \nTorshin also noted that he had grown up in a tiny village in Kamchatka. On a visit there in in 2008, he found only ruins and ashes where his house had once stood, an experience he seems to link to the need to defend hearth and home. \u201cYou are not afraid of anything after you see something like this.\u201d\nTorshin started collecting weapons 30 years ago, he said. \u201cSomething like a revolver, that you can hide in your vest, would be of interest for me,\u201d Torshin told Russian viewers, showing where on his body he would hide such a weapon. The official was convinced that he, as well as every Russian man, should have a chance to defend his house, his vehicle, and his church parish from \u201cyoung thugs.\u201d\nThree years ago, as a result of pressure from his critics\u2014who blamed Torshin for being \u201can American agent\u201d\u2014the senator lost his vice-speaker position in the upper house of the Russian parliament, the Federation Council. \n\u201cTorshin was pushing for the legalization of weapons. That idea was never popular among our law enforcement agencies,\u201d said Markov. \u201cMany believed that Torshin, a lifelong member of the NRA, was paid by American firearms producers, acting as their lobbyist.\u201d", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/whats-the-truth-about-the-nras-man-in-moscow?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Naveed Jamali", "body": "Introduction:\nMy relationship with the FBI and Russian intelligence began in 1988 when a Soviet Intelligence officer walked into my parents\u2019 office in midtown Manhattan. The man wanted to buy some books\u2014something that was in line with what my family\u2019s company did: \u00a0supplying the government with books. After the man left, two men walked into the family office and said, \u201cThat man was a Soviet intelligence officer... get him his books.\u201d \nIn 2005, with 9/11 fresh on my mind and the desire to join the Navy as an intelligence officer, I offered to help the FBI against the Russians who had been coming to the family office for almost two decades. In the years I worked as what the Russians believed was their spy, I saw how the Russians target and recruit Americans. It is these actions that I saw as an FBI double agent posing as a Russian spy that I believe were used in 2016. \nExcerpt from How to Catch a Russian Spy: new epilogue for paperback edition:\nI tried to warn you. Though the Cold War is supposedly over, the Russians still view America as enemy number one. They thirst for the return of Soviet glory. They\u2019re eager to expand their diminished sphere of influence. They\u2019ll stop at nothing to undermine the world\u2019s democracies\u2014 invading their neighbors, aligning with despots and terrorists, employing their espionage agents and computer skills to threaten any nation they view as an adversary.\nWho could possibly be surprised that the Russians would try to influence the outcome of an American presidential election? I know I wasn\u2019t. Before they came for Donald Trump and those around him, they came for me.\nNo longer are the Russians motivated by communist ideology. Power, money, and domination\u2014that\u2019s what they thirst for now. Their ruthlessness and craftiness haven\u2019t diminished one iota. They\u2019ve grown bolder. Not satisfied with trying to corrupt young Americans like me, they\u2019ve set their sights higher, aiming to exert influence in the Oval Office itself.\nI have no idea whether, in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Russians found those around Donald Trump\u2014or Trump himself\u2014easy marks, or whether in their subtle recruiting they received more than they bargained for, as they did when they tried to turn me. As I role-played with senior Russian military-intelligence officer Oleg Kulikov, my FBI handlers and I managed to outfox him and his superiors in Moscow. We wasted their resources. We buried them in disinformation. And as you\u2019ve read in prior pages, we unmasked Oleg, proving that this high-ranking United Nations diplomat was, in fact, a busy Russian spy.\nSomething tells me the Russians were more on their game this time around, but as I write this, it\u2019s still too early to know.\nNow, the whole world is focused on Russian espionage activities in the United States. Congressional committees are investigating. A special counsel is digging in. News pundits delight in conducting damage assessments. The political implications are enormous, extending to the highest levels. Our national security is at stake. And I find myself in a unique position, two years after How to Catch a Russian Spy was first released in hardcover. The story I told is suddenly at the center of everything. I lived it on the inside as few American civilians have. Everything I saw, everything I learned, everything I warned about is startlingly relevant. I have looked into the eyes of our Russian enemies. I know what they\u2019re capable of. To fully understand what\u2019s happening now, you have to recall\u2014and fully understand\u2014what happened to me.\nDuring the time I acted as a double agent\u2014a period that stretched from 2005 to my last meeting with Kulikov in late 2008\u2014the Cold War had long been over and the Russian threat had faded from the public eye. In a post\u20139/11 world, the FBI was focused on counter-terrorism, not so much counter-espionage. While the agents I worked with were dedicated professionals, they no longer had Russians on their minds in the same way their colleagues had in 1988, on the first day a Soviet intelligence officer walked into my parents\u2019 office in New York City. The Russians, on the other hand, always behaved as if their time in New York City was spent behind enemy lines. Consequently, Oleg Kulikov took great precautions to ensure he wasn\u2019t being observed. Exhibit A was his adamant refusal to use electronic communications like email or cell phones, which would have exposed him to FBI surveillance.\n\n\u201cHad the FBI been committed to playing the counter-espionage long game in 2008, might they have racked up subsequent wins against the Russians that would have changed the 2016 election?\u201d\n\nIndeed, during my time jousting with Oleg, Russian paranoia and a well-cloaked distaste for Americans influenced not just how Russian intelligence operators spied but also how they lived their daily lives. For instance, though they often took full advantage of the free American services offered to them, like public school educations for their kids, they refused to pay for tolls, viewing the activity as contributing to the U.S. government. My interaction with Oleg showed how comfortable the Russians were while operating in \u201cenemy territory.\u201d Take, for example, his telling me how to handle cash to avoid bank reporting or how he filled me in on the amount of access to information I\u2019d have once I joined the military. That these far-from-home Russians were in their comfort zone was no surprise; they\u2019d been running the same game for decades.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nI shouldn\u2019t have been surprised that the Russians were ruthlessly patient\u2014that they were completely willing to spend years studying and testing me before actually tasking me with retrieving information.\nOne of the most important lessons I learned during my operational time is how, in a world reliant on network and cyber security and focused on keeping outsiders out, it is relatively easy to recruit someone on the inside. The most effective firewalls and tallest guard towers are totally useless if a Russian operative can simply co-opt a person who has legitimate access to a facility. My ability to get access to Northrop Grumman or the U.S. government\u2019s Defense Technology Information Center (DTIC) database proves how effective the Russians\u2019 \u201cfind the insider\u201d approach can be. My actions were never even questioned by on-site personnel.\nThe truth is, so many of our security efforts are devoted to keeping the bad guys out that looking at those already inside becomes an afterthought. Or, as I liked to say to the FBI, \u201cLegitimacy is just a smile and an official business card away.\u201d\nThe Russian method, as I observed with Oleg, has always been to target potential spies, meet with them, and evaluate their suitability. The process can be excruciatingly slow\u2014even meandering. I would sit up at night wondering what plan the Russians had in store for me. I wondered, What is their master plan? Of course, retrospectively, I can see that I was putting the cart before the horse. First, the Russians wanted to determine if I could be used. They\u2019d save the how for later.\nIt\u2019s easy to wonder if, in the months leading up to the 2016 presidential election, the Russians were engaged in purposeful meandering aimed at determining the could. I\u2019d be willing to bet that they were. But I\u2019d also be willing to bet that the Russians succeeded in direct proportion to the extent that the FBI downplayed Russia\u2019s active-measures capability. My story serves as a reminder that American counterintelligence has slowly atrophied while precious resources and attention have been shifted to counterterrorism. At the height of my success infiltrating the Russian spy network, the FBI\u2019s unwillingness to take on more risk caused them to shut down the operation.\nIt was a decision that I\u2019ve always found to be both short-sighted and indicative of a larger issue. It seemed that those who ran the FBI were interested in short-term wins\u2014exactly the opposite of the Russian approach. The Russians were\u2014and are\u2014willing to play the long game and take risks. How can the FBI defend against that if they\u2019re not willing to roll the dice with an established operation like mine?\nI was willing to go in deeper. Scratch that. I was eager to. It was my FBI handlers or their superiors who decided to pull the plug. Had the FBI been committed to playing the counter-espionage long game in 2008, might they have racked up subsequent wins against the Russians that would have changed the 2016 election? That\u2019s a tormenting question that\u2019s hard to answer, and it keeps me up at night. The 2016 election was an awfully close one. The Russians clearly attempted to influence the results. Even a few switched votes could have changed everything. Who knows? By now, we could all be getting used to a second President Clinton, and Donald Trump could be recruiting contestants for a brand-new season of The Apprentice.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/i-was-a-double-agent-for-russia-and-theyre-at-it-again?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Sam Stein", "body": "Immediately following the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the National Rifle Association did what it always does: It shut up. \nThe biggest gun rights group in the nation didn\u2019t put out a statement on the shooting, which claimed the lives of 17 students. Its Twitter stayed dormant for five days. The group\u2019s Facebook page stayed quiet for four days, posting a lone missive on Monday, alerting followers to a billboard in Kentucky that read: \u201cKill The NRA.\u201d  \nBut outside of that, there was zilch. It was a case study in the public relations strategy known as \u201criding out the storm.\u201d \nBut not everyone under the NRA umbrella stayed silent. In the hours after Parkland, NRA TV, the television channel run by the gun rights lobby, continued producing content. At first, its anchors struck a conciliatory tone, noting that they shared the objective of making schools a safe place for children. Then they began pushing the company line: that school resource officers needed to be tactically trained and armed to prevent such shootings from being more gruesome. \nThen, it turned aggressive. \nOver the past two days, NRA TV has gone after both law enforcement for bungling the shooting and media outlets for calling for more expansive gun laws. Host Dan Bongino accused the New York Daily News of being both \u201cpure filth\u201d and \u201cnot worthy of collecting dog excrement\u201d\u2014aka actual filth. Host Dana Loesch called for protesters to march \u201cto the FBI offices\u201d for its failure to act on the numerous reports it received that the shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was dangerous and potentially unstable. Grant Stinchfield, another NRA TV host, added his thoughts on the fourth estate on Monday, suggesting reporters were eager for another shooting to push a gun control agenda. \nThere is a largely\u2014though not universally\u2014agreed upon theory within political circles that one of the reasons gun legislation is so difficult to get passed is because of the power of the gun rights lobby. The NRA has cultivated its image as the top dog on the Hill, able to whip up the frenzied support of its millions of members at even the slightest hint at a gun control measure may pass. \nBut the way in which the group is wielding its influence is changing. For decades, the gun rights group\u2019s political potency stemmed from its laser focus on a single issue that often transcends other partisan divides. Elected officials as far left as Bernie Sanders have maintained more mainstream positions on gun rights in the past precisely because the issue has historically appealed even to large numbers of Democrats in certain parts of the country. \nOver the last couple years though, the NRA has developed a far more robust social media presence, glossy advertising and branding efforts, and a bigger footprint in electoral politics. NRA TV is the epicenter of this new form of advocacy\u2014one in which right-wing politics and cultural signifiers are nearly as prominent as the Second Amendment itself. \nThe proof is in the billing. The show Frontlines, hosted by Oliver North and Chuck Holton, pledges to cover military and law enforcement matters, including \u201cradiological sabotage, counterfeiting and terrorism, to the threat of an unstable economy and cyber warfare.\u201d Bill Whittle\u2019s Hot Mic is pitched as a critique of the \u201cleft-wing pop culture's war on our freedom and rights.\u201d The show \u201cI Am Forever,\u201d which is no longer active, had a tagline that read: \u201cAmerican culture is at a crisis point.\u201d\nNRA TV\u2019s most prominent public voices have amplified this broader focus with commentary that conspicuously avoids mention of gun rights and, instead, toes a line more typical of an explicitly pro-Trump political organization. Hosts have been hyper-critical of NFL players for taking a knee in protest of racial disparities in the criminal justice system. They have hyped fears about undocumented immigrants and opined favorably about the president\u2019s so-called Muslim-ban. One host labelled the Black Lives Matter movement \u201ca weaponized race-baiting machine.\u201d\nTheir primary enemy, however, has been the media. Loesch, who signed on as a spokesperson for the group last year, has drawn headlines for a series of scathing videos attacking Trump\u2019s critics in the press, and has singled out a number of specific outlets for criticism.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nAsked about those videos and their focus on issues separate from gun rights, and in particular an NRA-alleged attempt by the political left to undermine Trump\u2019s 2016 election victory, Loesch defended the organization\u2019s broader political focus. \u201cMembers have many concerns, the attack on our republic\u2019s electoral process among them,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.\nThe multi-pronged, highly-aggressive approach to advocacy has made the NRA a more overtly political organization (though its polling numbers have remained somewhat stable). It\u2019s also made it more complicated to combat for gun control groups which are used to waging battles in the halls of Congress or in lower-profile town hall settings. \n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that they\u2019re ahead of the curve now,\u201d said Jim Kessler, a senior vice president for policy and a co-founder of Third Way and a longtime gun control activist. \u201cYou look at their leadership and it is a bunch of pudgy, pasty aging white guys. And they get overpaid. They are probably not working too hard. And you\u2019re thinking, this seems like some tired old industry\u2026 But underneath, there is a lot of shrewdness and dynamism. And they have so much money that they can experiment.\u201d \nRequests for comment made to the NRA were not returned. But critics of the organization also insist that they have branched out as an organization not just as a strategic imperative but out of financial necessity. The shift in the group\u2019s focus mirrors changes in U.S. gun ownership overall. Though the number of privately owned firearms in the U.S. is at an all-time high, those guns are owned by a diminishing percentage of households. \nThe NRA has countered that trend, experts say, by becoming more than just a gun group. The organization has put its brand on everything from sportswear to jewelry to safes, cigars, books and DVDs. For $134.95, one can buy an \u201cNRA Critical Food Supply\u201d bucket that would provide 56 dishes in lieu of a temporary power outage or a \u201ccatastrophic grid collapse.\u201d It has numerous publications, including the magazine America\u2019s 1st Freedom, and a prominent podcast. It also has a wine club, where first time members can get four \u201cexceptional\u201d bottles for under $30. And, this summer, you can join the group on a Freedom Cruise to Normandy, which Oliver North will host. \nIn the spring of 2017, it began selling a multi-pronged insurance policy, underwritten by the Chubb subsidiary Westchester, to provide legal protection to gun owners should they shoot someone out of self-defense or personal protection. The NRA called its product Carry Guard. Critics dubbed it \u201cmurder insurance.\u201d \n\u201cAt the end of the day we both either have to pass or stop laws,\u201d said Shannon Watts, founder of the gun control group Moms Demand Action. \u201cWhat they are creating is a marketing empire because what they are trying to do is sell guns and that requires marketing.\u201d \nThose who have followed the NRA, and fought it, say that its current incarnation is simply an extension of roads taken decades earlier. There was the \u201cRevolt at Cincinnati\u201d in 1977, when activists within the group voted out leadership after it had chosen to move its headquarters to Colorado in what was seen as a retreat from politics. There was Harlon Carter\u2019s transformation of the NRA into a fiercely political institution. There was the fundraising email that labeled federal agents \u201cjack-booted thugs,\u201d which prompted George H.W. Bush\u2019s resignation as a lifelong NRA member. And there was the infamous response to the shooting at Sandy Hook elementary in 2012, when executive vice president Wayne LaPierre declared that the only thing that could stop a bad guy with a gun was \u201ca good guy with a gun.\u201d \nAn organization that began as a stodgy gun club has increasingly become an avatar for a certain political lifestyle and ideological bend. \n\u201cThey have always been a little bit ahead of the Republican Party in moving away from button up business conservatism to white working class nationalism,\u201d said Cliff Schecter, a co-host of the UnPresidented podcast, a longtime gun control advocate, and a Daily Beast columnist. \u201dIn many ways, they were Trump before Trump.\u201d", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/nra-usually-shuts-up-after-mass-shootings-not-this-time?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "James Poulos", "body": "Here\u2019s a glaring sign of the turbulence of our political times: No sooner has the Tea Party been pronounced dead than we\u2019re hearing of liberal or progressive Tea Parties on the rise. Fearing his primary challenger is setting a trend, Rep. Dan Lipinski, (D-IL), now warns of a \u201ctea party of the left.\u201d At least one movement analyst proclaims the arrival of a new \u201ctea party of the pragmatic center-left.\u201d \nDemocrats may take inspiration from the idea that the conservative Tea Party died a particularly ideological death, obsolesced by a pendulum swing in popular opinion toward Trumpian deficit spending on the right and social justice on the left. But if the relatively sudden extinction of the Don\u2019t-Tread-On-Me brigades has a deeper, more serious root, political faith in a follow-on grassroots lurch leftward may be misplaced. \nAnd, as it turns out, there\u2019s reason to believe that the Tea Party fizzled out because it fell victim to the same inexorable force that\u2019s plowing under so many institutions large and small: the internet. \nOr, to be more precise, the logic and structure of online discourse. The biggest difference between Republican politics during the Tea Party era and Republican politics today isn\u2019t ideological\u2014although, to be sure, the difference is serious. Even more important is the vast conceptual and practical gulf that separates the very offline Tea Party routine of town halls and meetups from the very online movement that\u2014with slight exaggeration\u2014memed Donald Trump into the White House. \nYes, there were serious post-election efforts to take the Trump movement from social media to the town square. But these plans went terribly, predictably awry, hurting the movement and going viral only in the way of an epic self-own. And as for the mid-election rallies Trump himself loved so much, they took their cues more from the so-called fever swamps of online than they did from the old-fashioned constitutionalist cosplay of the citizen activists who defined the Tea Party. \nStill, Democrats have largely convinced themselves that the Tea Party, like the Trump movement, was just a handy vehicle for channeling and organizing simple bigotry. Whether in a Washington wig or a Pepe mask, hate is hate, they might say. The recent Republican retreat from deficit hawkery seemed to ram that point home: When a black president busts the budget, he\u2019s imperiling the Republic, but when an orange president does it, #MAGA!\nThis account, whatever its lures, misses out on some of what distinguishes a more technological and communications-driven approach. From that standpoint, the key to the Tea Party is that\u2014from Day One, during Rick Santelli\u2019s infamous rant\u2014the movement was thoroughly TV-driven. Although it attracted some online involvement from people who\u2019d go on to fuel the Trump-era digital right wing, the Tea Party didn\u2019t spread like a meme or frustrate counterattack like trolls do because it wasn\u2019t a digital beast. It played by pre-digital rules for pre-digital ends, like better citizenship, better representatives, and better policymaking. \nThen the internet took over on the right. It unearthed and organized a new generation\u2014one that didn\u2019t want to use established means to right the wrongs of a systemic crisis. For the new online right, the goal was nearly the opposite: to infect the system and heighten the crisis, forcing the system to replicate behavior the system didn\u2019t want to. \nAnd, to the shock of TV people everywhere, it worked. But the TV-culture view of the digital right is still dangerously wrong. True, the new online right of the Trump era doesn\u2019t care about balanced budgets. True, that\u2019s because it rejects the politics of \u201cresponsibility\u201d altogether. But why? Because if you\u2019re on the right and you\u2019re immersed in digital life, the way you approach politics as a whole has been, let\u2019s say, \u201cdigitized.\u201d \nOnline life doesn\u2019t habituate us to transparency and responsibility in financial matters. What it does counsel is that everything continuously expands and can\u2019t be corralled. It teaches that no one entity can encompass the whole. So why would the budget be any different? Online, violating expectations for laughs is almost a foundational principle. So why not an about-face on spending? If it goes viral, go with it. Chances are, you\u2019ll have the momentum and the command of attention it takes to prevail in the aftermath. \nFor Democrats and Republicans alike, it\u2019s worth carefully considering that the Tea Party is toast because the new right is digitally native, inspired, and organized by a definitive extent to the thought patterns of online life. Because if that experience can rip apart and reconfigure one major party, there\u2019s no reason it can\u2019t do the same to the other. Instead of a mirror-image Tea Party anywhere on the left of center, prognosticators should watch for the rise of an outsize new political force ready to triumph through its mastery of digital life.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-internet-conquered-the-right-killed-the-tea-party-and-elected-donald-trump-5?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Marlow Stern", "body": "During a rally on Monday, President Trump called the Democrats \u201ctreasonous\u201d for not applauding during his terribly boring, terribly grim State of the Union address. \u201cThey were like death and un-American.

Skripal was found collapsed on a bench with the woman in the riverfront shopping district in the cathedral city of Salisbury.\nWiltshire police say they have not yet confirmed that a crime has taken place but their response to the discovery of the potential victims suggests they are taking that possibility seriously. Officers sealed off the area and later shut down the emergency room at the hospital for fear that the suspected substance could affect other people.\nSkripal was a Russian army colonel who worked for the army inteligence unit known as the GRU. He was arrested in 2006 for passing information to the British about Russian spies dating back to the 1990s. The FSB, the notorious successor to the KGB, claimed that Skripal was recruited by the British in the mid-1990s and was paid up to $100,000 into a bank account in Spain for a decade\u2019s worth of spying.\nHe retired from the GRU in 1999 before joining the Russian Foreign Ministry until 2003. In a trial three years later, the Russians say they discovered that he had been shopping information on \u00a0Russian spies stationed all over Europe.\nHe was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2006, but he was released early and allowed to retire in Britain\u2019s picturesque South-West as part of a major spy swap. At the time of his release, his lawyer said Skripal was concerned about his health as he was suffering from diabetes.\nUntil the British authorities have obtained toxicology reports it will remain unclear whether Skripal\u2019s collapse raises suspicions about Russian influence.\nIn previous examples of suspected Russian assassinations in Britain, the poison has not been detected until long after the victims had sought medical assistance.\nFormer FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko died in agony in a North London hospital after polonium-210 was slipped into a pot of tea at a Mayfair hotel by two Russian agents Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun.\nIt was weeks before the authorities identified the highly unusual radioactive poison and many more years until an official inquiry formally found that Litvinenko had \u201cprobably\u201d been murdered on the orders of the Kremlin.\nThe case of Alexander Perepilichnyy, a Russian whistleblower who collapsed while running near his home in the suburbs outside London, was even more embarrassing for the British authorities.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

It was a scandal that would rock American politics and law enforcement to its core and, at a minimum, raise serious questions about the integrity of the investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election. The memo was released on Friday afternoon. And the White House\u2019s reaction to its release has been conspicuously muted. Late into Friday afternoon, President Donald Trump had not publicly discussed or tweeted about the memo since fielding questions about 45 minutes prior to its release. The White House did put out a formal statement on the memo. But it was done under the name of the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. \u00a0The most prominent social media presences in the administration put nothing about the memo on Twitter. White House officials were entirely absent from the airwaves to discuss it. Allies to the administration and friendly Capitol Hill Republicans received little to no guidance from the president\u2019s team about what their spin on the memo should be. A senior aide to a House Republican close to Trump told The Daily Beast that the White House had issued no messaging instructions whatsoever. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten none,\u201d the aide said. \u201cIt\u2019s been oddly quiet actually.\u201d Another source, a prominent White House surrogate, reported \u201csilence\u201d in the lead-up to the memo\u2019s release early Friday afternoon.For an administration that was generally expected to exploit the memo in an effort to insulate the president from an ongoing Justice Department investigation, the fact that said exploitation didn\u2019t actually take place was viewed curiously. One interpretation was that the White House was intent on letting the memo speak for itself, convinced that the damage would be clear and indisputable. Another was that it reflected an administration whose press shop is capable of ginning up a controversy but not well versed in managing the fallout. The memo, authored by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, alleges that the FBI sought a surveillance warrant against former Trump campaign aide Carter Page using a dossier compiled by a former British spy at the behest of an opposition researcher on retainer for the Democratic Party. House Democrats have vehemently disputed the memo\u2019s conclusions. But within hours of its release, conservative groups were laying the groundwork to use the memo to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into alleged Russian election-meddling on behalf of the Trump campaign in 2016.Trump reportedly hopes that the memo will give him the pretext to rein in Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, whose acquiescence Trump would need to officially sack Mueller. But in the wake of the memo\u2019s release, even the White House\u2019s official response was relatively muted.In public remarks prior to the memo\u2019s release, the president called the memo\u2019s allegations \u201ca disgrace.\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Sanders released a statement saying that the memo \u201craises serious concerns about the integrity of decisions made at the highest levels of the Department of Justice and the FBI to use the Government\u2019s most intrusive surveillance tools against American citizens.\u201d But that was the extent of White House communications about the memo.

Taking to Twitter, Donald Trump Jr. laid out the case that the memo would spark a fundamental overhaul of the top tiers of the entire Justice Department.

I had just told the Russian intelligence officer that I had been accepted into the United States Navy\u2019s Reserve Intelligence program, and would soon be an intelligence officer. \nMonths before that, I had handed Oleg copies of various paperwork about both the program and my application but now he wanted more \u2014he wanted to bring back more solid evidence for his superiors documenting the importance of the man he had recruited to spy for Russia. It was one of our many conversations that relied on face-to-face meetings, that allowed me to fool the veteran Russian spy into believing that he was recruiting me, while in fact I was an FBI operational asset.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Russia is actively involved in collecting intelligence on the United States and running operations to undermine America. It is a craft Russia has honed and carried out since the fledgling days of the Cold War, and one that Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s indictment of 13 Russians, with more reportedly coming, re-enforces is still very much active. \nWhile Mueller\u2019s indictment doesn\u2019t mention the Russian government, it presents methods\u2014such as sending covert agents to operate clandestinely in the United States\u2014that are hallmarks of their intelligence services. Russian intelligence officers arrive in the United States, often posing as diplomats, in what is known as \u201cnon-official cover.\u201d \u00a0As Meuller\u2019s indictment puts it, they come \u201cfor the purpose of collecting intelligence to inform Defendants' operations.\u201d \nFrom my own experience working as a double-agent against Russian intelligence from 2005 to 2009, I know that they collect that intelligence by targeting and recruiting Americans to serve as operational assets. \u00a0\nIn the digital age, a common question is why the need to recruit spies? Couldn\u2019t spy services simply collect intelligence from afar? Why risk sending Russians to the United States? \nAs I learned from my years speaking with Russian intelligence, they are distrustful if not paranoid. As such, I found that the Russians sought to temper their suspicions by understanding the source that is providing them with intelligence \u2014 something that requires face-to-face meetings. It is why, for example, in spite of my repeated offers to provide intelligence files over email or other ways that did not require us to meet in person, my handlers steadfastly refused and insisted on meeting to speak with me. These meetings, I learned, were critical in evaluating me. If they didn\u2019t trust me, then they couldn\u2019t trust the intelligence I was passing them. Oh the other hand, if they could validate me and trust me as a source then that trust was extended to the intelligence I provided them. \nThere was another reason for relying on trusted assets for intelligence: Protecting the information that Russia sought. The paranoia of Russian intelligence extended to the belief that they were under constant surveillance by the FBI \u2014 a notion that gains credibility in the detailed description of emails and conversations released in Mueller\u2019s most recent indictment. \nThe value of intelligence collected by Russian intelligence officers was severely diminished if the FBI discovered that Russia had collected it, which is why they chose to have me collect intelligence instead of trying to do so themselves. And in an era of endless and potentially everlasting digital breadcrumbs, it was far better to let an America source collect intelligence and hand it over then risk compromise and detection by doing it themselves.\nThat same paranoia, I found, made the Russians highly selective in who they chose to recruit. Showing up with a juicy piece of classified intelligence was not enough. They wanted to understand why somebody would be willing to spy for them. The answer to that question was as important, if not more so, than the intelligence an asset could provide. \nIt was not enough that I was a young man intent on joining the United States Navy as an intelligence officer, my Russian case officer had to believe that I wanted to spy for Russia. This meant creating a persona that would meet the Russian profile of a spy. While I couldn\u2019t change my name or where I lived or went to college, I could invent a caricature of a person I believed the Russians were looking for. So I played the part of a young arrogant man obsessed with money who saw service in the Navy singularly as a way to access information he could sell Russia to enrich himself. It was a profile the Russians understood and accepted, and ultimately the reason they allowed me into their network of spies. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

I am sure that Russia continues to recruit Americans to support its intelligence operations, and continue to have a similar profile of the type of person that is susceptible to such overtures\u00a0\u2014 someone who is willing to sell for profit access and information from the office they hold.\nThere is no longer much question that Russia recruited Americans to help in their attack on the 2016 elections.

For 15 years, Steele has had his race used against him, with the bipartisan critics and the media often amplifying the notion that he has to be kept \u00a0in his \u201cplace.\u201d\nI know first hand, having worked on Michael Steele\u2019s 2006 Senate race and at the Republican National Committee while Steele was chairman. But while I had come to expect it from his liberal opponents, I\u2019m distressed to see the \u201cconservative\u201d movement echo these lines. \nIt began back in the 2002 Maryland Gubernatorial race, when Steele was candidate for lieutenant governor. The liberal editorial page of the Baltimore Sun questioned Steele\u2019s credentials, saying he brought \u201clittle to the team but the color of his skin.\u201d Four years later, the Sun was at it again, patronizingly terming Steele a \u201clikable man and persuasive speaker\u201d \u2013 articulate and clean, anyone?\nSteny Hoyer, the House Minority Whip has called Steele \u201cslavish\u201d\u2014for which he had to apologize\u2014 while Maryland State Senate President Mike Miller called Steele \u201cUncle Tom.\u201d The Democratic National Committee, in a 37-page memo by Cornell Belcher sought to \u201cturn Steele into a typical Republican candidate \u2014 as opposed to an African-American.\u201d \nWhen Steele ran, successfully, for RNC chair in 2009, the dirt continued to be thrown at him. In 2009, MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough declared that \u201cRepublicans are learning right now, that sometimes being black isn\u2019t enough. They thought \u2018we\u2019re going to get a black guy to run our party.\u2019\u201d\nAlways outspoken, but also a former seminarian, Steele handled this with a characteristic mix of class and combativeness. But even as he was able to deal the slings and arrows coming his way, the comments raised serious questions about how much of the political universe views race. \nWith the communications director of CPAC declaring, from the stage this past week, that Steele was elected as RNC chair \"because he's a black guy,\u201d it raises even more serious questions about how Trumpian tribalism has quickly become the rule of law within a large segment of the GOP. \nThis is terrible for our party. \nWhile Republicans may see speaking to minority audiences as a low priority, they should realize that minorities are closely watching them. For African-Americans to see the man who is likely the most prominent African-American Republican on the airwaves, treated this way, is another sign of a Republican Party that is not interested in winning their votes. CPAC is an event I used to attend nearly annually but have not in several years. Over time, the conference has taken more and more of a tribal posture, seeking to cast out what it decides are \u201cbad\u201d conservatives in favor of \u201cgood\u201d conservatives with a roster slouching towards the extreme. Last year it was Milo Yiannopoulos, who was ultimate disinvited from CPAC after sponsors balked. This year, it was Marion Le Pen of France\u2019s National Front, whose politics are so controversial in her home country that French rocker Johnny Hallyday had the family banned from the funeral. Unlike Yiannopoulos, Le Pen was not disinvited. Instead, she was welcomed as a hero, if not the conquering one.\nOf course, CPAC\u2019s conquering hero is clearly Donald Trump. Just two years after canceling his 2016 speech under the threat of a walk out, Trump has become the belle of the ball, fully in control of an adoring audience all too happy to boo Senator John McCain and other Republicans who don\u2019t sufficiently grovel to him. \nDoes anyone honestly believe that these comments would have been said about Steele had he been a Trump acolytes instead of a detractor? The obvious and honest answer is no. That may be fine if Trump is enjoying high popularity. But he is not. He is in a politically tenuous position\u2014with low popularity ratings and an ever-encroaching Russia investigation\u2014not the position of power.\nAll of which puts the GOP in precisely the position many believed the party was heading the day before Trump\u2019s surprise election. It also means that whenever Trump is no longer president, the GOP will still be divided, with limited desire or effort to appeal to minorities, and no road map forward. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Wynn denied the allegations in a statement to the Journal.The report nonetheless puts the RNC in a bind after it made a show of demanding that Democrats return money that Weinstein donated to their campaigns over his years of activity in party fundraising circles. Numerous Democrats ended up giving their Weinstein donations to either charities or, in some cases, political groups who work to elect progressive female lawmakers. Officials at the RNC and those close to it deemed such giving insufficient and accused other lawmakers of being complicit in not forcefully condemning Weinstein. The RNC, which last year chose not to distance itself from another official credibly accused of sexual harassment\u2014Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore\u2014did not respond to a request for comment as to whether they would now do the same. Nor did Sean Spicer, the president\u2019s former press secretary and the committee\u2019s former top strategist, who was particularly aggressive in criticizing Democrats after the Weinstein revelations. Wynn has donated more than $2 million to Republican campaigns, party organs, and interest groups since 2001, according to FEC records. That includes more than $1.3 million to the Republican National Committee (compared with the $300,0000 in donations that Weinstein gave to the DNC) and the party\u2019s House and Senate campaign arms. He also bundled between $250,000 and $500,000 for Sen. John McCain\u2019s presidential campaign.Wynn has also contributed to Democrats, such as the party\u2019s former Senate leader, Nevada\u2019s Harry Reid. He was friends with other prominent Democrats, including longtime Harlem congressman Charlie Rangel.But the vast majority of Wynn\u2019s political contributions, and public advocacy, have been directed towards Republicans. In 2014, Wynn got into a public spat with George Clooney after the actor alleged that Wynn had called President Barack Obama an \"asshole.\" Years later, he became a booster of Donald Trump. Wynn and Trump, whose own Vegas hotel sits near Wynn\u2019s resorts, have been friends for some time, and Trump has even bragged that he helped brand Wynn\u2019s company.In addition to his donations in support of Trump\u2019s election, Wynn spearheaded fundraising for the president\u2019s inaugural committee, which raked in a record-smashing $107 million. He was subsequently appointed as the RNC\u2019s chief moneyman. Under his purview, the RNC has recruited other fundraisers close to the president, such as Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s longtime attorney.Wynn\u2019s relationship with Trump goes back decades, and has been, at least for public show, a rather love-hate reality-TV-style affair. A 1998 New York magazine article documented their feud, and that \u201cTrump and Wynn despise each other so much that they\u2019ve aligned themselves with rival morning-radio proxies.\u201dHowever, in the years since, the two grew closer, to the point that Wynn became one of Trump\u2019s top political allies. Most recently, Wynn co-hosted last Saturday\u2019s gala and fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago celebrating the one-year anniversary of Trump\u2019s inauguration, with proceeds going toward the RNC and the Trump re-election campaign. Ticket prices ranged from $100,000 to $250,000. President Trump was supposed to headline the event, but ultimately could not make it due to the government shutdown.

This is part of a group of nerve agents known as novichok. Based on the positive identification of this chemical agent by world-leading experts at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down, our knowledge that Russia has previously produced this agent and would still be capable of doing so.\n\n\n\u2014 Prime Minister Theresa May\n\nThe person who understands the effects of novichoks best is Vil Mirzayanov, a scientist and later head of Foreign Technical Counterintelligence at the State Scientific Research Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology (GosNIIOKhT) in Moscow in the 1970s and 1980s, which allegedly produced the shadowy class of binary nerve agents known as the \u201cnovichoks\u201d (newcomers). And he has a message for Skripal and his daughter: my bad.\n\u201cI\u2019d tell him [Skripal] that I\u2019m very sorry that I participated in the development of these weapons,\u201d Mirzayanov told The Daily Beast.\nGosNIIOKhT scientists developed the agents under a program codename \u201cFolio\u201d beginning in the 1980s. Mirzayanov spoke out about the covert program as the Soviet Union fell, earning him a prison term at home before he escaped to exile in the United States.\nDuring the Cold War, the idea that a novichok agent would be used in a covert assassination seemed alien to Mirzayanov and his fellow scientists. The weapons, developed in intense secrecy by Soviet scientists, were originally designed for use in bombs and shells on a battlefield rather than a cloak-and-dagger assassination in a suburb in southern England. \n\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine. No one could imagine. It\u2019s outrageous. We were convinced at the time that we were developing these weapons and testing others for the protection of the country and for defense,\u201d Mirzayanov said. \u201cIt was not our goal. None of the scientists supposed that it would be used with terrorist goals. It was a military thing. It was a weapon for mass killing.\u201d\nDespite the lethality of novichok agents\u2014reportedly 10 times as powerful as the VX nerve agent used to assassinate Kim Jong Un\u2019s brother in a Malaysian airport\u2014Skripal and his daughter managed to survive the attack and are recuperating in the hospital. But Mirzayanov expects that the two have a long road to recovery.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re poisoned by a nerve agent, it\u2019s forever,\u201d Mirzayanov said, citing the case of his friend and fellow GosNIIOKhT employee, the late Andrei Zheleznyakov, who was accidentally poisoned by a novichok.\nZheleznyakov received a dose of A-232, a component used in Novichok No. 5, during a laboratory accident in the 1980s. Doctors gave Zheleznyakov atropine, a common nerve agent antidote, and he survived following a lengthy recuperation. But the once vibrant researcher was never the same, according to Mirzayanov: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t capable of functioning normally afterwards.\u201d Zheleznyakov reportedly suffered from chronic weakness, epilepsy, liver problems, and difficulty focusing, among other maladies, before his death five years later.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d tell him [Skripal] that I\u2019m very sorry that I participated in the development of these weapons.\u201d\n\u2014 Vil Mirzayanov\n\nIn Skripal\u2019s case, British investigators may have been able to identify the use of a novichok with help from a portable mass spectrometer, according to Mirzayanov. The scientific devices could detect the presence of a novichok if investigators had reliable information on the chemical composition of the nerve agents.\nFor the prime minister to be able to publicly accuse the Russians of using a nerve agent like a novichok, British authorities at least must have had access to novichok\u2019s unique chemical signature\u2014which it legally could have had despite the Chemical Weapons Convention, due to the clause of countries being able to hold samples for testing in these incidences.\nTesting for novichoks, even based on a formula published by Mirzayanov in a memoir based on his work in the 1980s, is a potential sign that the British have potential access to newer variants of the nerve agent. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nGwyn Winfield\u2014the editorial director of CBRNe World magazine, a trade publication for those dealing with chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or explosive threats\u2014said it\u2019s possible that the Russians continued to develop novichoks in the years after the publication of Mirzayanov\u2019s book. But even then, the British were probably able to reliably gather minute traces with a novichok\u2019s unique chemical signature.\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to detect the phosphate chain, and they [mass spectrometers] are probably looking at broad families detecting something hazardous in the environment,\u201d Winfield added. \nWinfield said it\u2019s also important to note that we don\u2019t yet have any idea what particular novichok variant hit the Skripals and the police officer who responded to them.\nWhen Winfield first heard about the incident, he and other journalists thought it was a fentanyl overdose. \u201cWhen the Salisbury Hospital shut down, [it was done so for] fentanyl poisoning,\u201d Winfield told The Daily Beast. \u201cThat sounded right, that we were looking at two individuals who had overdosed on something.\u201d\nFentanyl wouldn\u2019t be out of the question: Prior to its more recent use in the United States as an opioid, Winfield said the drug has been used for assassination attempts. \u201cIt was effective and inefficient, and there was plausible deniability,\u201d he said, pointing out that victims could be thought to have overdosed.\nWhen Prime Minister May came out and said the culprit was novichoks, Winfield said he was surprised, particularly given that Skripal reportedly became aggressive, waved his arms, and pointed to the sky while yelling in Russian, he said. \u201cThose don\u2019t fit into what we know about organophosphate exposures,\u201d Winfield explained\u2014which means that while novichok is being pointed to as the source nerve agent, it\u2019s possible that it was swirled with another drug that produced hallucinogenic qualities that were more similar to a fentanyl poisoning.\n\n\u201cIf they wanted to kill me, it would\u2019ve been easy. But God has saved me so far.\u201d\n\u2014 Vil Mirzayanov\n\nBut that\u2019s impossible to confirm, Winfield said. \u201cIt might have been a cocktail of drugs, it might have been [Skripal\u2019s] unique physiology,\u201d he surmised.\nThe business of killing with chemicals is an ugly one and it weighed heavily on Mirzayanov\u2019s conscience in the waning days of the Cold War. The former Soviet scientist once in charge of protecting GosNIIOKhT\u2019s secrets from Western spies began a crusade to eradicate chemical weapons with a Moscow News article and an interview with The Baltimore Sun in 1992.\nMirzayanov told The Daily Beast that representatives from the U.S. intelligence community later urged him not to publish chemical formulas and compounds for the production of novichoks because of concerns about the dissemination of know-how for the powerful weapons.\n\u201cThe U.S. government doesn\u2019t like me because they can\u2019t use me like a puppet,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a puppet. I refuse to cooperate the way they want. I told them, \u2018Go to the court and challenge me.\u2019 I believe Russian secrets are not American secrets.\u201d\nThat we don\u2019t know much about the subsequent development of novichoks after Mirzayanov had access to GosNIIOKhT\u2019s secrets means it\u2019s also hard for us to know how the Skripals got sick. \u201cIt could be a gel, vapor, or a liquid,\u201d Winfield said. Nerve agents tend to use corrosive acids, which mean their precursors are usually stored separately, Winfield said, but it\u2019s possible this novichok doesn\u2019t require mixing of chemicals and could be directly applied to a person\u2019s skin or on a surface with \u201cjust a pair of gloves,\u201d he said.\nWinfield said that at this point, there are more questions than answers about novichoks and how they were used in the Salisbury attack. That Skripal, his daughter, and the police officer lived is also puzzling, given that Mirzayanov said practically no human testing occurred, unlike other nerve agents like sarin and VX. The survival of the victims could be due to human incompetence or their unique physiology, or even the cooler temperatures, that saved them.\nWith Russian intelligence veterans like Alexander Litvinenko and Sergei Skripal in the crosshairs of assassins, some dissidents are now worried about their own safety. Mirzayanov, 83 years old and living openly in Princeton, New Jersey, is unmoved by the potential threat from the Russian government.\nAfter he spoke out against GosNIIOKhT\u2019s chemical weapons programs, Russian authorities arrested Mirzayanov and put him in the KGB\u2019s notorious Lefortovo Prison in Moscow. He survived, walking out of a place where so many before him had entered but never left. \n\u201cIf they wanted to kill me, it would\u2019ve been easy,\u201d he says now. \u201cBut God has saved me so far.\u201d", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/sorry-i-developed-the-weapon-that-poisoned-a-russian-spy?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Margaret Carlson", "body": "Gary Cohn resigning as national economic adviser is bad for the adult quotient in the West Wing, as well as for the Dow Jones. \nBut just as big a worry as who\u2019s leaving is who\u2019s staying. Although not the shiny object that Cohn (or Hope Hicks, Rob Porter, or Steve Bannon), cabinet secretaries who would be long gone in any other administration are hanging on, redecorating (see HUD Secretary Ben Carson\u2019s $31,000 desk while removing anti-discrimination language from his agency\u2019s mission), flying flags over their headquarters to signal they are in charge while turning over public lands to oil drillers excepting his home state of Montana (Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke), and increasing security details with a new $25,000 safe room lest anyone hear him endangering clean water (EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt). \nWhile each has violated norms in his own way, one thing unites them: the president is not insisting they leave because they haven\u2019t violated his standard. And that standard is: If you don\u2019t beat your wife with a picture that proves it, or dump all over Trump and his family in a best-selling book, you are doing a helluva job. \u00a0\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions, though, is a special case. Trump would love to fire him, yet he persists, enduring despite the worst insults Trump can think up and spell correctly. Over the weekend, I heard Sessions tell a friend from Alabama that it will take a lot more than Trump\u2019s taunts\u2014specifically \u201ca bullet between the eyes\u201d\u2014to remove him. This may be a relief even to many Democrats who know that any replacement would likely be so much worse. (The Justice Department refused to comment when asked about the Sessions remark.)\nA bullet might not be enough to unseat Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin by dint of multiple Inspector General\u2019s reports detailing dismal performance and ethical violations. Shulkin took a lengthy trip to Europe with as much touring as official business and with his wife along for the ride at taxpayer expense. When his explanation that the trip was approved because he was getting an award, the invitation he offered to prove it was forged. He both claimed the VA was hacked and fired his chief of staff, who did the forging at his instruction. He explained tickets to Wimbledon by claiming they were given to the couple by a \u201cfamily friend,\u201d who it turned out was no such thing. \n\n\u201cPruitt got a waiver to fly on Air Emirates, to protect him from angry Italians on a one-way trip from Milan, an airline known for its cocktail lounge, full beds and hot showers.\u201d\n\nThe latest IG report reveals that Shulkin, the one Obama appointee Trump liked enough to keep, is continuing to run the VA into the ground. Blaming complacency and inattention, the IG found \u201csystemic\u201d failures resulting in a lack of medical supplies, including prosthetic limbs and surgical implants, dirty conditions, chronic understaffing, and 1,300 boxes of veteran\u2019s health information sitting in a hospital basement, a warehouse, and a trash bin. Shulkin is still in his job, despite being pressed to leave by two top aides and a fellow Republican, Rep. Mike Coffman, who heads the panel overseeing the VA. Shulkin\u2019s response has been a pledge to root out dissidents and to hire his own public relations firm. They may well have advised him not to show up on the dais despite being listed in the official program at last weekend\u2019s Gridiron dinner, a spring ritual where official Washington and those who cover them dine together without a food taster. The Daily Beast reported last week that there is another IG report in the works, this one on Shulkin using staff for personal errands. \nWho did show up at the Gridiron was EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. Almost no one approached him during the break despite his insistence that he\u2019s so recognizable it\u2019s not safe for him to fly coach. In one day that cost the taxpayer $14,434 when Pruitt commandeered a government jet to fly from Tulsa to Oklahoma City, about $300 otherwise, and a one-hour trip from Washington to New York at $1,641.43 rather than about $400. First class domestic is not always enough. He got a waiver to fly on Air Emirates, to protect him from angry Italians on a one-way trip from Milan, an airline known for its cocktail lounge, full beds and hot showers. \nLike Shulkin, Pruitt is paranoid, diverting agents from environmental crimes to expanding his security detail to round-the-clock unprecedented size, and sweeping his office for bugs. On Tuesday, Democratic Senators Sheldon Whitehouse and Thomas Carper sent a letter to Pruitt demanding an explanation by March 21 for how he justified awarding that contract to a business in which a member of his current security detail has a financial interest. That\u2019s reminiscent of another no-bid contract award to the Republican opposition research firm Definers Public Affairs\u00a0last December to search out \"resistance figures\" opposed to his agenda. \nThis pales next to what he\u2019s costing the planet. \"I think there's assumptions made that because the climate is warming, that that necessarily is a bad thing. . . it's fairly arrogant for us to think that we know exactly what it should be in 2100.\" What about the temperature on Wednesday in New York bringing with it snow thunderstorms, a new phenomenon. Pruitt quotes the Bible to defend exploiting the earth, saying that God expects it and hopes it will benefit business. Rescinding the regulation prohibiting the coal industry from dumping their runoff directly into streams benefits mine owners, not mine workers who live nearby.\nTrump is sanguine about Cohn leaving even as he carves out exceptions to the trade war. Trump doesn\u2019t follow his annoying globalist but he does follow the markets. On Tuesday, Trump, who knew Cohn was leaving, said he didn\u2019t mind losing people and that, in fact, he had a few other positions \u201che\u2019d like to change.\u201d \nHe could begin with Shulkin and Pruitt; let another adult, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, stay on; and move on to Carson, who admits running HUD is harder than brain surgery. Trump likes setting records and losing those three for starters would keep up his current one for turnover\u201443 percent in his first year, with fewer than half of the 12 positions closest to him still occupied by his initial choices, according to the Brookings Institution. If, as Trump said Tuesday, people are clamoring to join his staff, he will hardly have time to miss them.

That war, for the past three years, has featured indiscriminate civilian bombing and facilitated a mass famine and cholera outbreak. And its primary mover is the Saudi defense minister and heir apparent, Mohammed bin Salman, ubiquitously known as MBS, who is slated to meet with President Trump at the White House on Tuesday. \nIt\u2019s been a long procedural road for a resolution pushed by independent Bernie Sanders, Democrat Chris Murphy, and Republican Mike Lee to end aid for the Yemen war. Their resolution, introduced in the Senate foreign relations committee on March 1 and therefore ripe for a move to the floor, holds U.S. assistance in that war in violation of the 1973 War Powers Resolution. The resolution\u2019s remedy is not to a congressional vote to authorize aid to the Saudis, but to stop it outright. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could\u2019ve predicted this would occur when the Crown Prince was in Washington, but I think the upcoming public debate on the Saudis\u2019 devastating war in Yemen will send a strong signal about Congress\u2019s growing reticence to continue fueling this conflict,\u201d Murphy told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cWe believe U.S. military support for the Saudis\u2019 war in Yemen is illegal, immoral and harms national security.\u201d\n\u2014 Sen. Chris Murphy\n\nAs early as Tuesday afternoon, The Daily Beast has learned, the senators will push for a so-called motion to discharge the resolution from the committee. If they get a simple majority, it will proceed to the Senate floor for a lengthy period of debate that may stretch into Wednesday. The debate would culminate in a vote, also by simply majority, on immediately ending U.S. military assistance to the Saudi forces MBS commands. \nAll this comes with procedural hurdles. The Pentagon rejects the \u201cfundamental premise\u201d of the antiwar resolution. Its acting top lawyer wrote to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell last month that \u201cthe limited military and intelligence support that the United States is providing to the [Saudi]-led coalition does not involve any introduction of U.S. forces for purposes of the War Powers Resolution.\u201d The resolution\u2019s backers expect that McConnell or another senator will raise that issue to preempt a floor debate. \nBut the antiwar senatorsy think that they have the stronger argument. Section 8(c) of the resolution defines the \u201cintroduction of United States Armed Forces\u201d to include servicemembers who \u201cparticipate in the movement of...military forces of any foreign country or government when such military forces are engaged.\u201d Since U.S. tanker aircraft that refuel Saudi warplanes that bomb Yemen necessarily facilitate military movement, the senators think they can bat back a challenge to their resolution on those grounds. \nThe 32-year old MBS, the son of ailing octogenarian King Salman, rapidly consolidating power, and a portion of that effort runs through Washington. After MBS cultivated Jared Kushner and Trump himself, resulting in Trump\u2019s rapturous reception in Riyadh in May, MBS felt free in November to purge and imprison actual and potential rivals for the levers of Saudi control, particularly the economic ones. While MBS billed it as an anti-corruption effort, the fantastically wealthy Saudis he detained at the Ritz Carlton surrendered what the New York Times called \u201chuge sums of money\u2026 [and gave] government control of precious real estate and shares of their companies,\u201d giving it the air of a shakedown. \u201cOnly death,\u201d MBS told 60 Minutes on Sunday, can stop his ascension to the throne. \nAfter a triumphal heir-apparent tour of Egypt and Britain, MBS and a gigantic retinue are en route to the U.S., which is \u201chis gateway to becoming king,\u201d said Ali al-Ahmed, director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs and a critic of the royal family. \nA Senate fight on Yemen during his visit will make him \u201cvery upset,\u201d al-Ahmed believes, as \u201cthe man does not like to be told no\u2026 He feels entitled to get his way. When he hears from the Senate that that\u2019s what the U.S. wants, if that\u2019s what they say, he\u2019ll be extremely upset.\u201d As defense minister, MBS \u201cdoes not run away from [the Yemen war], he owns it, he says it\u2019s necessary,\u201d al-Ahmed said. \u00a0\nThe U.S. military doesn\u2019t go that far, but it has made clear it considers support for its anti-Iran friend in Riyadh more important than the starvation, disease and deaths of millions of Yemenis. Even though the Murphy-Sanders-Lee resolution does not restrict the military from attacking suspected terrorists in Yemen, a Pentagon document for senators acquired by HuffPost portrayed counterterrorism as collateral damage from a successful resolution, intimating that \u201cSaudi Arabia may reallocate resources from counterterrorism to the counter-Houthi fight.\u201d \nTrump plans on discussing the Yemen war with MBS as well, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on Monday.

But he ponied up the $2,000 ticket price after the group\u2019s senior adviser, Scott Dworkin, sent him a personal invitation.Months later, Siddiqui, the Democratic challenger to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), was surprised to discover his money\u2014or three of every four dollars of it\u2014had gone to the coffers of consultants and lawyers the group leaned on to fight a libel suit, rather than pushing back against the president. When told by The Daily Beast how the group had spent where his money, Siddiqui was, charitably speaking, not pleased. \u201cBeing an attorney,\u201d he said, \u201cI intend to investigate this further and look forward to receiving a full explanation about the use of donations.\u201dThe Democratic Coalition, one of the many new progressive-minded organizations to bloom in the age of anti-Trump fervor, brought in nearly half a million dollars last year. Its donors include Siddiqui, a pair of Hollywood television producers, a former Real Housewife of Miami, and a member of the U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors. The vast majority of its funds, however, have come from people whose names don\u2019t make it into Federal Election Commission disclosures: the small, \u201cunitemized\u201d donors who give $200 or less.It\u2019s what the group has done with its money\u2014not how much it has brought in\u2014that has raised eyebrows among other operatives. The Democratic Coalition paid more than half of the money it raised last year to its employees or their consulting firms, according to Federal Election Commission records. Dworkin\u2019s Bulldog Finance Group was the chief beneficiary, drawing more than $130,000 from The Democratic Coalition. The breakdown in 2016, when the Democratic Coalition declared its goal was \u201cmaking sure that Donald Trump never became President,\u201d was even starker. That year, Dworkin and other staff members received more than 90 percent of all of the Democratic Coalition\u2019s expenditures, either personally or through a consulting company, according to FEC records.On top of those expenditures, the Democratic Coalition has also spent $127,500 in legal fees since late 2016. Those fees stem from a libel lawsuit brought by a North Dakota doctor who donated $2,700 to the Trump campaign. The Coalition dubbed him a \u201cmajor benefactor of the Trump campaign\u201d and accused him of ties to former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and terrorist elements in that country. The case was settled last summer under undisclosed terms. But the Democratic Coalition never informed current or prospective donors that their contributions would help cover what have turned out to be six-figure legal expenses. \u201cTo ensure we could have as large an impact as possible, we reached an amicable agreement with Dr. Benaissa that includes language prohibiting any of us from speaking about the matter, other than to acknowledge its existence,\u201d a spokesperson for the group said.The apparent self-dealing and large legal expenditures have left some donors to the organization angry with what they see as a waste of money and energy. It\u2019s also left Democratic operatives worried that money is being sent to organizations that are engaged largely in self-promotion at a time when resources are needed for midterm election contests and sustained advocacy against Trump.\u201cHe is conning people into giving him small-dollar donations so he can pay himself and sustain an organization that gains him credibility,\u201d said one top party operative, who agreed to speak candidly about the Democratic Coalition on condition of anonymity. \u201cIt\u2019s a fucking abomination.\u201dThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Officials at The Democratic Coalition insist that they have been upfront about their expenses. They also say that campaigns they are running rely on staff overhead and don\u2019t lend themselves to a the FEC\u2019s periodic disclosure requirements of political activity.\u201cWe've done a ton of work online\u2014much more of it organic social media than paid social media\u2014so most of it hasn\u2019t been the kind of things that get itemized in a FEC report. Instead, they\u2019re expenses paid directly out of consulting fees,\u201d said Chuck Westover, a senior adviser to the Coalition. \u201cThe whole picture isn\u2019t in there.\u201d\u201cOur work has had and continues to have a real impact,\u201d Westover added, \u201cso it\u2019s not a huge surprise that we have attracted some detractors.\u201dThere are no laws governing how much of a PAC\u2019s resources must be devoted to employee compensation or reportable \u201cindependent expenditures.\u201d The only check on how most groups spend their money is donors themselves, and most don\u2019t bother, or don\u2019t know how, to explore the matter before donating small, unitemized sums. Last year the FEC unanimously backed recommendations to Congress for new laws governing groups that exist solely to raise money and pay their own executives, but no such legislation has even been considered.Largely free to operate how they please, groups on the left and right have used dramatic fundraising appeals promising huge political operations to solicit lots of small-dollar contributions (and some larger ones). But little in the way of policy advocacy or political operations ever takes place. Campaign finance experts have a term for this. \u201cWe saw the rise of \u2018scam PACs\u2019 during the Obama years, where grifters would tap into anti-Obama sentiment to raise mostly small-dollar donations from grassroots conservatives, and then pay themselves consulting fees rather than use the money to support candidates or causes,\u201d Brendan Fischer, the director of federal and FEC reform programs at the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center, said in an email. \u201cThe Democratic Coalition seems to be using a similar playbook, only here they are tapping into anti-Trump sentiment.\u201dWhether Dworkin is running the equivalent of a \u201cscam PAC\u201d depends on who you ask. His reputation in progressive circles is decidedly mixed. He was a relatively unknown consultant for years, taking on clients outside the Democratic mainstream. Former Rep. Alan Grayson (D-FL) hired him for fundraising help on his 2006 run. The Florida Democrat ultimately didn\u2019t need the help after building up a massive community of small dollar donors online. But he recalled Dworkin as \u201ccompetent.\u201d \u201cUnlike a lot of people in politics he actually focused on his responsibilities rather than pontificating,\u201d Grayson told The Daily Beast. \u201cAnd that was a good thing. It was worthwhile.\u201d Others have less generous things to say. Fellow Democratic consultants told The Daily Beast that Dworkin had a reputation for running up massive administrative costs and paying himself. They see his current venture as an extension of that crass opportunism. \u201cHe is nowhere near a movement leader. He is a political operative who, in my opinion, targets first-time candidates who often don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know. And he has a trail of frustrated clients and coworkers,\u201d said Nomiki Konst, an operative turned investigative reporter for The Young Turks, who said she once worked with Dworkin. \u201cThe majority of political campaign consultants are in it for the money and not always for the win. But Scott Dworkin is in his own class.\u201dDworkin defended himself against those charges in an email to The Daily Beast. \u201cI don\u2019t call myself a leader of any movement,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI say I help lead The Resistance. It\u2019s a group effort and there are too many moving pieces for there to be only one leader.\u201d\u201cIn regards to candidates,\u201d he said, \u201cI was one of the few people in Washington willing to give a shot to the underdog. To even listen to them. And I\u2019m glad I did. Sometimes no one else would.\u201dOne thing Dworkin\u2019s foes and boosters do agree on is that he has an incredible capacity to pitch\u2014whether it be a cause or himself. \u201cIt is all flash and all substance with him,\u201d is how one prominent Democratic fundraiser put it. \u201cBut he\u2019s a great talker and he is great in meetings.\u201dThe Democratic Coalition certainly has a reputation that exceeds its size or budget. The group, and Dworkin himself, are hyperactive on Twitter, crafting lenthy threads of tweets attempting to draw ties between Trump and the Russian government, or implicate other high-ranking Republicans. Those tweets are frequently punctuated with exclamations designed to draw the attention of journalists and news consumers\u2014Exclusive! Breaking!\u2014but occasionally report information that originated in the mainstream political press hours earlier. Dworkin is now raising money for a new project: an eponymous podcast. He\u2019s brought in just under $15,000 of his $50,000 goal on crowdfunding platform Indiegogo, where his page declares that he and the Democratic Coalition \u201chave worked to lead the Resistance.\u201dDworkin\u2019s Twitter bio is a case study in overstatement too, his detractors say. On it, he lists himself as an \u201cObama Alum.\u201d Few people in the prior administration remember him though. That\u2019s because Dworkin didn\u2019t serve in the administration, per se. He was the deputy director of engagement to the 2012 Democratic convention. Steve Kerrigan, the CEO of the convention committee and now a Massachusetts congressional candidate, recalled Dworkin as \u201ca great addition to our team.\u201dBy that point, Dworkin had begun to establish himself in Democratic circles. During the 2010 election cycle, his firm, Bulldog Finance Group, signed a number of congressional candidates and began bringing in sizable consulting fees. FEC records show federal PACs and candidate committees paid Bulldog more than $875,000 from 2009 through 2016. Dworkin\u2019s consulting business hit a bit of a lull last year, when his firm reported just one federal client beyond the Democratic Coalition: California House hopeful Wendy Carrillo. Instead, he has focused on the Coalition, where his efforts have involved both a robust, often conspiratorial, stream of online postings\u2014including allegations of treason against the president\u2014as well as a stream of legal complaints filed against high-profile Republicans.What the group hasn\u2019t done much of is overt politicking of the kind generally associated with political action committees. It reported just $2,350 in independent political expenditures last year, to pay for two billboards promoting the candidacy of Sen. Doug Jones, the Democrat who scored an upset victory in December\u2019s U.S. Senate special election in Alabama. Billboards are widely considered a waste of political money. Despite the questionable use of its funds, donors don\u2019t seem to be particularly concerned or even all that attentive. One relatively big giver to The Democratic Coalition first said he could not recall actually writing his four-figure check to the group. But when told that he had, in fact, done so, he responded: \u201cI do hope they\u2019ve done something good with our money.\u201d He spoke on condition of anonymity out of embarrassment for not remembering donating his money. The day after talking to The Daily Beast, the donor received an email from The Democratic Coalition asking for money for their next project: A billboard outside of Rep.

The administration\u2019s legislative framework for a bipartisan immigration bill will include a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million people, White House policy chief Stephen Miller told Capitol Hill Republican staffers on Thursday.Miller, describing the White House\u2019s outline as one that includes \u201cextremely generous provisions\u201d and \u201cdramatic concessions\u201d to Democrats, said the administration\u2019s plan allows for 1.8 million undocumented immigrants to have a pathway to American citizenship if they have \u201cwork history, the right amount of education, and good moral character.\u201dMiller spoke on a briefing call for members of Congress and their staff. The Daily Beast obtained an access code for the closed press call. That number includes the nearly 700,000 people currently protected under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, plus individuals who did not apply for DACA \u201cbut otherwise met its requirements,\u201d according to Miller.The legislative framework, which will be released in full on Monday, also includes $25 billion in funds for border security measures including a \u201cwall system.\u201d Miller said the plan also includes a \u201chistoric investment in northern border security.\u201dMiller, a noted immigration hardliner and a close adviser to President Donald Trump, said the White House\u2019s outline represents \u201ca compromise position that we believe will get 60 votes in the Senate.\u201d He said the bipartisan \u201cGang of Six\u201d plan unveiled earlier this month is dead on arrival and \u201chas no chance of going anywhere or ever becoming law\u201d because it does not include what the White House views as must-have provisions.The plan also dismantles the so-called chain migration system, which allows lawful permanent residents to sponsor immigrants who want to come to the United States. Under the Trump administration\u2019s proposal, family sponsorships will be limited to \u201cspouses and minor children,\u201d effectively ending what Miller called \u201cextended family migration.\u201dAdditionally, those changes will not be applied retroactively, meaning that applications currently being considered would continue even after the legislation is signed.Moreover, the visa lottery program\u2014which prioritizes immigrants from parts of the world where immigration to the U.S. is the lowest\u2014will be scrapped in favor of a system that Miller described as \u201chigh-skill based.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Michael Daly", "body": "As we come to the 2018 Winter Olympics, an alleged Russian organized crime boss retains a long-standing world record as the sole person ever indicted for fixing a gold medal.Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov remains a fugitive as the \u201cVor\u201d or crime boss behind Skategate, the fixing of pairs figure skating and perhaps also the pairs ice dancing at the 2002 Winter Olympics. He was indicted by none other than James Comey, who was then the Manhattan U.S. attorney.\u201cHe arranged for a classic quid pro quo. \u2018You line up support for the Russian pair and we\u2019ll line up support for the French pair, and everybody will go away with the gold, and perhaps there\u2019ll be a little bit of gold for me,\u2019\u201d Comey said when announcing the charges.As if that were not enough, Tokhtakhounov went on also to be indicted in 2013 for running a criminal organization involved in money laundering and arms trafficking, as well as a multimillion-dollar gambling operation based in Trump Tower, three floors directly below the penthouse of the man who is now our president.Tokhtakhounov\u2014also known as \u201cAlik\u201d and \u201cTiwanchik\u201d\u2014 is now doubly indicted in the United States, but safely ensconced in his native Russia. He likely remains disappointed in having still failed to achieve what the feds say was his ultimate goal in Skategate: securing a renewed visa that would allow him to resume living in France.According to press accounts, Tokhtakhounov moved from Russia to France in the late 1980s. He reportedly became a kind of expat Vor, described in court papers as being the go-to Russian mafia boss in Paris, engaged in, \u201camong other things, drug distribution, illegal firearms sales, and trafficking in stolen vehicles.\u201d He settled into a beautiful apartment in the 16th arrondissement, reportedly purchased on his behalf by a Russian-Israeli-French \u00e9migr\u00e9 named Arcadi Gaydamak, who figured in a scandal of his own known as Angolagate, which eventually embroiled embroiled Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, son of the French president.In court documents, Gaydamak is said to have to have facilitated the sale of $790 million in weapons during the Angola civil war, from 1993 to 1998. Tokhtakhounov\u2019s other pals are said to include Michael Cherney, who figured in the bloody \u201caluminum wars\u201d in the 1990s for control of the Russian metals business.When Tokhtakhounov\u2019s visa expired, French authorities declined to renew. He moved to Italy, where law enforcement authorities wiretapped his phone as part of Operation Spider Web, an investigation into the laundering of $9 billion in ill-gotten gains siphoned out of Russia.In early 2002, Italian authorities informed the FBI that they had intercepted several phone conversations that offered some insight into an uproar over the gold medal for pairs figure skating at that year\u2019s Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.The Canadian pair, Jamie Sal\u00e9 and David Pelletier, had executed a routine that left the crowd calling for perfect scores.\u201cSix! Six!\u201d Six!\u201dThe performance of the Russian pair, Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, was generally considered inferior, but the judges had voted 5-4 to give them the gold.Thank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The instant controversy prompted the French judge, Marie-Reine Le Gougne, to break down and confess that she had voted for the Russians at the insistent urging of the president of the French Skating Federation (FSF).The French judge subsequently recanted, but her initial admission gained considerable credence when the FBI translated the Italian wiretap recordings.\u201cOur Sikharulidze fell, the Canadians were 10 times better, and in spite of that, the French with their vote gave us first place,\u201d Tokhtakhounov was recorded telling a Russian skating official shortly after the pairs skating completion.\u201cWith one vote we won,\u201d the Russian skating official said.The transcripts show that Tokhtakhounov had gotten the phone number of the Russian official by calling a crony shortly before the Olympics. Tokhtakhounov told the crony that he had been contacted by the mother of Marina Anissina, a Russian-born ice dancer who was competing with the French.\u201cRegarding the Olympics?\u201d the crony asks in the transcript.\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Tokhtakhounov says.\u201cWe will help her,\u201d the crony says.\u201cThat\u2019s a given,\u201d Tokhtakhounov says,The crony provided Tokhtakhounov with the number and assured him that the Russian official would be helpful.\u201c[The official] is close to us, he is a good guy,\u201d the crony says. \u201cHe will do it\u2026 Because there is a lot for him there.\u201dIn the ensuing conversation shortly after the pairs figure skating and shortly before the ice dancing, the Russian official sounds more than happy to do Tokhtakhounov\u2019s bidding.\u201cEverything is going the way you need it,\u201d he tells Tokhtakhounov. \u201cEven if she stumbles\u2026 but it is better if she does not stumble.\u201dThe official says of the upcoming ice dancing, \u201cThe French can only win by the score of five to four.\u201dTokhtakhounov told the Russian skating official that he would call Anissina\u2019s family and let them know. The official told Tokhtakhounov that he would call Anissina and tell her, \u201cI am doing this for Alik [Tokhtakhounov], although I want you to help him with something.\u201dTokhtakhounov informed the Russian official that Anissina had already approached the president of the FSF about helping the mob boss renew his French visa.\u201cShe would do anything, but could not,\u201d Tokhtakhounov says in the transcript. \u201cThat president, he is a homo, promised, but did nothing.\u201d\u201cI told you, the problem is with him,\u201d the Russian skating official says. \u201c[Anissina] strong-armed him, she is one of ours,\u201d Tokhtakhounov says. \u201cShe is one of ours, and she will be an Olympic champion,\u201d the Russian official says.\u201cThank you,\u201d Tokhtakhounov says. \u201dShe will be grateful to you for the rest of her life.\u201dThe Russian official notes that the ice dancer will be performing in five days. \u201cI am telling you that not everything is good with the judging for her,\u201d the Russian official says.\u201cBut you will help, right?\u201d Tokhtakhounov says.\u201c[Anissina] strong-armed him, she is one of ours.\u201d\u2014 Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov\u201cOf course, we will help because you told us to do it, and because the French helped us here,\u201d the Russian official says.The Russian official tells Tokhtakhounov again how helpful the French were.\u201c[The Canadians] performed cleanly and beautifully,\u201d the Russian official says. \u201cTheir scores are 6.0 and they got 5.8 and 5.9.\u201dThe Russian official adds, \u201cWith one vote we won. That one vote was French, because the French have nothing except for the ice dancing.\u201dHe meant that ice dancing pair was the only chance the French had for gold. He noted that in making the Russian-born Anissina a champion they were also helping one of their own.\u201cShe is a Russian girl, and we will feel good about it,\u201d the official says.\u201cOf course,\u201d Tokhtakhounov says.Tokhtakhounov was then recorded telephoning Anissina\u2019s mother.A woman identified as the mother says, \u201c[The Russian official] called me from America, he told me we are going to make [Anissina] an Olympic champion\u2026 Yesterday, the French, the French helped the pair figure skating, gave the last vote. [The Russian official] said, \u2018For this we will make [Anissina], even if she falls, we will make sure she is number one.\u2019\u201dTokhtakhounov tells the mother, \u201c[The Russian official] said he will help, he has two or three judges\u2026 So, make [Anissina] happy, tell her we will help her, and do it all.By then, the uproar over the pairs figure skating gold medal was such that the Russian official may not have felt comfortable enough for a straight fix. The Russian judge did not vote for the French, but the result was just what the Russian official promised Tokhtakhounov.\u201cThe French team won the ice dancing completion by a five to four vote, as [the Russian official] stated,\u201d the FBI criminal complaint notes.A week later, Tokhtakhounov was recorded speaking directly on the phone with Anissina. She told him that she had not called him earlier from America because the president of the French Skating Federation had forbidden her.\u201cThe FBI were interviewing [the president of the FSF] because information came in that [Tokhtakhounov] was involved with the results,\u201d a woman identified as Anissina says.\u201cThat is nonsense,\u201d Tokhtakhounov says. \u201cHe is frightened. There is nothing.\u201d\u201c[The FSF president] came, told me, and they really did check him, the FBI,\u201d Anissina says.\u201cIt was him they were checking,\u201d Tokhtakhounov says. \u201cWhat does that have to do with me? He knows my name very well. He tried to help me, and later made up stuff to scare you, so you would not connect me to him even more. He was protecting himself.\u201dAnissina tells Tokhtakhounov that the Russian skating official had come up to her \u201cyelling at me, \u2018Call Alik, you are such a bitch, not calling.\u2019\u201d\u201cNo, no, no, the reason [the Russian official] said this to you\u2026 a week before your performance\u2026 I contacted your mother\u2026 \u00a0[the Russian official] said, \u2018Alik, everything is OK there even if,\u201d Tokhtakhounov says in a jumble.He then catches himself, \u201cI just don\u2019t want to say now.\u201dThe FBI complaint notes that Tokhtakhounov indicates on several occasions in this conversation that he is concerned Anissina\u2019s phone is tapped. \u201cEverything is good, even if everything turns out badly, it will still be good.\u201dThe complaint suggests Tokhtakhounov \u201cis reluctant to discuss the full scope of the scheme with the female ice dander during this telephone call.\u201dIn the transcript of the call, Tokhtakhounov does quote the Russian skating official telling him, \u201cEverything is good, even if everything turns out badly, it will still be good.\u201dAt one point, maybe out of pride or worry about a wiretap, Anissina tells Tokhtakhounov that she believes she would have won without his help. Tokhtakhounov quotes the Russian skating official as having said before the competition, \u201cEverything will be OK, [Anissina] should not be concerned, let her perform, even if she falls, everything will be OK.\u201dNear the end of the call, Tokhtakhounov sought details of what the French skating official had said.\u201cHe said there are inquiries, he said he was asked about this association with you, he said, \u2018I know him, there was something regarding hockey,\u201d\u2019 Anissina reports.\u201cHe is lying,\u201d Tokhtakhounov says. \u201cWe have nothing in common.\u201dThe criminal complaint notes that the FBI had indeed made inquiries. The president of the FSF told the agents he had been contacted by Tokhtakhounov approximately two years before.\u201c[Tokhtakhounov] contacted the FSF president and stated that the wanted to organize a professional hockey team in Paris, France, which would be operated by the FSF,\u201d the complaint reports. \u201cTokhtakhounov explained that he would give large amounts of money to sponsor athletic teams. After several conversations with the president of the FSF, Tokhtakhounov started that in connection with sponsoring the hockey team, he needed a favor. Specifically, Tokhtakhounov stated that his French visa was expiring and that Tokhtakhounov needed the president of the FSF to assist him in obtaining an extension. The president of the FSF told Tokhtakhounov he would see what could be done.\u201dThe FSF president inquired with the appropriate French government official.\u201cAfter several months, this official told the president of the FSF that Tokhtakhounov\u2019s money is bad and that the FSF should not get involved with Tokhtakhounov,\u201d the complaint reports. \u201cThe president of the FSF informed the FBI that he told Tokhtakhounov that the FSF was not interested in Tokhtakhounov\u2019s proposal and that he had not seen or spoken to Tokhtakhounov again.\u201dThe Olympic Committee sought to rectify the situation by awarding gold medals to the Canadian figure skating pair as well as the Russian pair. Comey\u2019s remedy was to indict Tokhtakhounov. Italian police arrested the accused Olympic fixer and lodged him in the Santa Maria Maggiore prison in Venice.After a hearing in which the wiretap recordings were played, a judge ordered Tokhtakhounov\u2019s extradition.But he appealed, and a higher court found in his favor. He was freed in 2003 after a year in the Venice prison and returned to Russia. He there purchased a small Moscow newspaper and made it energetically pro-Putin. He is also said to have started running from afar a $100 million gambling and money laundering operation headquartered on the 63rd floor of Trump Tower.The New York office was run by Vadim \u201cDima\u201d Trincher, the other senior member of what is termed the \u201cTiwanchik-Trincher Organization\u201d in a 2013 federal racketeering indictment. Trincher was arrested, pleaded guilty, and received a five-year prison term.Now under two indictments, Tokhtakhounov remained safely in Moscow. He had only to think of his associate Viktor Bout to be reminded of the dangers of venturing outside Russia when wanted by the United States.Bout had been arrested in Thailand in 2008 and extradited to the United States on terrorism and arms trafficking charges. He is said to have played a role in Angolagate and also sold weapons to everybody from al Qaeda to the Taliban to Iran to guerrillas in Colombia. He was tried in Manhattan federal court, the same venue where Tokhtakhounov would have been tried had the higher Italian court not overturned his extradition. Bout was convicted in 2011 and sentenced to a 25-year term.Bout\u2019s fate prompted Tokhtakhounov to send the Russian daily Izvestia an op-ed letter, perhaps the first such missive ever penned by an alleged mob boss.\u201cThe problem with these kinds of stories is that the United States regularly and harshly blamed our citizens for some incredible crimes, after which it takes a long time to prove one's innocence and clean oneself of negative impact,\u201d Tokhtakhounov wrote.\u201cThis means that American gain trumps in the political game against Russia, and we have no way to fight it, no recourse.\u201dHe did not likely intend a pun. The world was still six years away from imagining that Donald Trump might ever become president.\u201cAmericans might intervene everywhere, and we, as it turns out, cannot adequately respond. Why can the U.S. authorities arrest a Russian citizen in a third country and extradite him and try him without our intervention? And we do not intervene, because Russia is still in some ways a dependent country. It is difficult for us to utilize strong initiatives to protect our citizens.Tokhtakhounov\u2019s op-ed went on, \u201cIn this case, time is a doctor. Thanks to our current authorities, the country is growing mightier.\u201d\u201cMaybe in five to10 years, in some cases, we'll be able to unzip the fly [on our pants], so to say, and show them.\u201d\u2014 Alimzhan ToktakhounovThe \u201ccurrent authorities\u201d meaning Vladimir Putin.\u201cAnd maybe in five to10 years, in some cases, we'll be able to unzip the fly [on our pants], so to say, and show them.\u201dTokhtakhounov could not likely have foreseen just how right he would prove to be. Putin would essentially do exactly that thanks to the malleable narcissist in the penthouse three floors up from where the Vor set up shop in Trump Tower.In the meantime, Trincher was released to house arrest, which meant he was confined in splendor as federal prisoner 68454-054 directly below the Trump residence all during the presidential campaign and during the first seven months of the new administration. Federal probation officers faced the novel prospect of having to pass through the Secret Service to run spot checks on a felon.As for Bout, he has appealed to Trump to allow him to be retried before an international tribunal.And Tokhtakhounov is no doubt greatly enjoying the spectacle of America upending itself like some clown on ice. He has even been able \u00a0to see Comey get fired and smeared.At least the rest of us can watch those beautiful Olympic skaters complete with perfect grace so unlike what we are witnessing in our politics.In these Winter Olympics, it is even legit, unless somebody is out there trying to match Tokhtakhounov\u2019s world record for fixing a gold medal.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-russian-mobster-who-fixed-the-winter-olympics?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Caleb Gayle", "body": "Last year, then White House chief strategist Steve Bannon declared\u00a0his \u201cline of work is destruction of the administrative state,\u201d so that \u201cif you look at these cabinet appointees, they were selected for a reason and that is destruction.\u201d \nMy home state of Oklahoma was quietly doing this long before Bannon announced the plan. Last week, Alicia Priest, president of the Oklahoma Education Association made her way to the pulpit of a well-attended press conference to demand, among other things, a $10,000 pay raise for teachers, who are among the nation\u2019s lowest paid, just below their counterparts in West Virginia. That came after years of losing talented educators to neighboring states, and after legislators this year blocked a pay raise for teachers. Prist then talked about \u201cdrastic efforts to save public education,\u201d drawing national headlines for her talk of a teacher strike beginning on April 2. \nWhile public school teachers may be among the most recent, easily identified and best organized victims of the destruction of the administrative state, they\u2019re hardly the only ones in Oklahoma. Subtle in some ways and overt in others, the erosion of the state government from within has been underway here \u00a0nearly a decade, since Republican Mary Fallin became governor in 2010 on a platform of reducing income taxes and cutting state spending while giving even more support to the oil and gas industries.  \nIn Oklahoma, companies drilling for oil and gas do not pay property taxes on the land holding their reserves, resulting in a \u201cgross production tax\u201d of approximately 3.2 percent, compared to 8.3 percent in Texas and 13.4 \u00a0percent in  Wyoming. In 2015, that tax cheme amounted to a $470 million dollar break\u2014draining money that could have gone to the state. \nFallin finally got her tax cut 2016, a .25 percent trim that cost the state nearly $157 million dollars that fiscal year. That, coupled with price fluctuations for the state\u2019s darling industry, oil and gas, opened up a gaping budget deficit that\u2019s compelled more cuts at already overstretched and underfunded agencies across the stat\u2014many with secretaries, directors and commissioners who had already been sticking out their necks for the axe. \nThe same year Fallin came to office, Scott Pruitt, now Trump\u2019s administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, became attorney general of Oklahoma. Though not appointed by Fallin, he worked as part of her administration to weaken the powers of his office, eliminating its \u201cenvironmental protection unit,\u201d and zeroing out the budget for environmental law enforcement. In its place, he created a \u00a0new Federalism Unit to fight national environmental regulations.\nFallin did appoint Dr. Terry Cline, a holdover from previous administrations, to serve as both Commissioner of the Oklahoma State Department of Health and Secretary of Health and Human Services (OSDH). Decreases in the tax-base and budget troubles hit Cline\u2019s departments the hardest. OSDH sought to reduce costs by furloughing any employee making above $35,000 one day every two weeks and cut funding for nine child abuse prevention programs and 25 health centers. Recently, the department announced its intention to cut its workforce by 12 percent. \nAs the health agencies\u2019 budget problems worsened, Commissioner Cline resigned in October 2017 after the State Board of Health called out his mismanagement. The FBI and the Office of the Inspector General of US Department of Health and Human Services launched an investigation into the use of federal funds at the state\u2019s health department, whose financial situation became so dire that then-Interim Commissioner Preston Doerflinger warned salaries would go unpaid without emergency funding from the legislature.\nBut Doerflinger\u2014who resigned last month amid domestic abuse allegations from 2012\u2014is no fiscal hero here. Rather, he played one of the most significant roles in damaging both the state\u2019s ability to function but also its reputation. \nBefore his brief stint as interim health commissioner, Fallin had appointed Doerflinger to be secretary of Finance and Revenue. In this role, he architected the entirety of Fallin\u2019s fiscal policies and the drastic cuts that resulted from them. In 2016, he oversaw a 16 percent reduction in higher education funding. In 2017, state troopers were warned not to fill their cars\u2019 gas tanks, drunk drivers kept their licenses because there weren\u2019t enough staffers to revoke them, an nearly a fifth of the state\u2019s school districts shifted to four-day weeks to cut costs. \nBannon must be proud: Oklahoma\u2019s administrative state is in shambles and the contradictions are heightening, fast.\nOklahoma\u2019s taxes on the production of oil and gas are among the lowest in the country.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/before-bannon-the-destruction-of-the-administrative-state-started-in-oklahoma?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kelly Weill", "body": "Vanished neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin must give up his whereabouts, a federal court in Montana ordered Wednesday.Anglin, who runs the white supremacist website Daily Stormer, has been on the lam for a year, fleeing a lawsuit by a Jewish woman whose address Anglin posted online.

Anglin\u2019s attorneys have attempted to dodge the lawsuit by claiming he lives outside the country, and that he worries for his personal safety if he reveals his location. A federal court isn\u2019t buying it.Anglin has until February 16 to tell the court where he\u2019s living, ruled U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeremiah Lynch.The lawsuit against him originated in the Montana hometown of fellow white supremacist Richard Spencer.Spencer, who has called for ethnic cleansing and shouted \u201chail Trump\u201d to a crowd of followers throwing Nazi salutes, is from Whitefish, Montana. After Spencer\u2019s profile as a white supremacist rose in 2016, Spencer\u2019s \u00a0mother became involved in a dispute with Gersh, a local real-estate agent. Gersh said she had simply decided not to work with Spencer\u2019s mother.But Spencer\u2019s mother (or Spencer himself, Gersh\u2019s lawyers claim) wrote a blog post accusing Gersh of harassment.

In April 2017, she partnered with the Southern Poverty Law Center to sue Anglin for distress and intimidation.The neo-Nazi hasn\u2019t been seen since. Anglin\u2019s lawyer Marc Randazza claims Anglin can\u2019t face the lawsuit because he does not belong to any U.S. state.

But at a committee meeting on Monday, he declined to give members details that were requested about the direction of that investigation, The Daily Beast has learned. At a committee meeting on Monday evening, members voted unanimously to release a Democratic rebuttal to Nunes\u2019 instantly-infamous memo, which alleged the FBI improperly sought authorization to surveil a former Trump campaign adviser. But while the vote was unanimous, the committee hearing was tense, according to multiple sources familiar with the proceedings.Members on the committee wanted Nunes to provide additional detail on his efforts to investigate the DOJ and FBI\u2014an inquiry Nunes first confirmed to Democrats last week, as his justification for denying Bureau and Justice officials a chance to detail their objections to the release of his memo. Nunes, according to sources familiar with the matter, declined to share details of that investigation with members. That might seem like a small, passive-aggressive moment in yet another of Capitol Hill\u2019s endless partisan squabbles. In reality, it\u2019s much more. Nunes and his White House allies already have put enormous pressure on the FBI\u2019s leadership. A deputy FBI director named in the document has stepped down, and the Justice Department official overseeing the Russia probe\u2014Rod Rosenstein, lifelong Republican\u2014is facing increasing criticism fellow Republicans. Three quarters of Trump voters now say the FBI is biased against the president, according to a recent poll.Nunes\u2019 next steps could go even further to undermine public faith in the various probes into the Trump-Russia nexus. And what makes the situation particularly unusual is that the committee\u2019s rules require its chairman to consult with the top member of the other party when starting a probe. Adam Schiff, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, told reporters last week that Nunes did not consult with him before starting his new investigation.It\u2019s the latest example of a jagged divide between the committee\u2019s Republicans and Democrats. Those tensions came into relief over the previous few weeks, when Republicans pushed to release the controversial memo Nunes\u2019 staff wrote. The document claimed that senior officials at the FBI and Justice Department misled a secret surveillance court about the political provenance of ex-British spy Christopher Steele\u2019s dossier when asking a judge to permit surveillance on Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page. House Republicans, who led a weeks-long social media campaign to #ReleaseTheMemo, said it revealed corruption of the worst kind; Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican, tweeted that the memo\u2019s allegations were \u201cworse than Watergate.\u201d President Donald Trump declassified that memo last week. And several errors in its text quickly became evident, including one of its primary assertions. The document claimed that DOJ attorneys never told the court that political partisans funded some of the material they referenced in their application to surveil former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page. In the days since the memo\u2019s release, however, Nunes and Rep. Trey Gowdy ,who supervised the its production, both conceded that the application included a footnote saying partisans were involved in funding some of its material.On Trump-favorite TV show Fox and Friends, Nunes pivoted Monday to say that \u201ca footnote saying something may be political is a far cry from letting the American people know that the Democrats and the Hillary campaign paid for dirt that the FBI then used to get a warrant on an American citizen to spy on another campaign.\u201dIn other words: Nunes went from claiming that the FBI misled the court, to saying the Bureau had notified the judges\u2014just not in big enough type.Though the narrative spun in memo suggests that Steele\u2019s information was the most important element of the Page surveillance, it doesn\u2019t actually go that far. Instead, Nunes\u2019 memo calls the Steele dossier an \u201cessential part\u201d of the surveillance application on Page, all without clarifying how. (Court filings, however, show the FBI knew Page was in contact with Russian spies as far back as 2013.) The furthest the memo goes in establishing the dossier\u2019s centrality to the Page surveillance is a citation to outgoing FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe claiming \u201cno surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information,\u201d but sources familiar with McCabe\u2019s testimony told The Daily Beast on Friday that the memo mischaracterizes McCabe, who didn\u2019t make that claim.Thank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Nor was surveillance on Page the genesis of the FBI Russia probe that special counsel Robert Mueller inherited. On its final page, Nunes\u2019 memo concedes a core premise: Information concerning \u201cfellow Trump advisor George Papadopoulos\u2026 triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016.\u201d On Fox  Friends, Nunes downplayed what his own memo described. \u201cAs far as we can tell,\u201d adviser Papadopoulos \u201cnever even had met with the president,\u201d Nunes said. That\u2019s incorrect: Trump himself tweeted a photo of himself at a meeting with a visible Papadopoulos.\u00a0(\u201cHe\u2019s an oil and energy consultant, excellent guy,\u201d Trump told the Washington Post in 2016 about Papadopoulos.) Papadopoulos is now cooperating with Mueller\u2019s team. \u00a0\u00a0The rhetoric from Trump and his allies has not reflected any of this. Trump claimed Nunes\u2019 memo vindicates him in the Russia probe \u2013 despite Republican members of the intelligence committee backpedaling that the Nunes memo \u201cis not a rebuke of Bob Mueller\u2019s investigation,\u201d as former CIA officer and committee member Rep. Will Hurd said at a Monday forum. Nunes instead told Sean Hannity \u2013 who had earlier said the memo would make Watergate look like \u201cstealing a Snickers bar from a drugstore\u201d \u2013 that the \u201cbigger problem, challenge here, is that the mainstream media is totally uninterested in this. Can you imagine if the shoe was on the other foot?\u201d Nunes also asserted that the \u201cclear link to Russia\u201d was Hillary Clinton, not Trump. \u201cIt seems the counterintelligence investigation should have been opened up on the Hillary campaign when they got ahold of the dossier,\u201d he told Hannity on Monday night. \u201cIn other words: Nunes went from claiming that the FBI misled the court, to saying the Bureau had notified the judges\u2014just not in big enough type.\u201dAfter Monday\u2019s committee vote to release a Democratic rebuttal to Nunes\u2019 memo\u2014which Trump must decide to release by Friday\u2014Schiff, the senior Democrat on the panel, dismissed Nunes\u2019 additional efforts at looking beyond Trump-Russia questions. \u201cWe hope these phases of distraction will come to an end and once again the committee will focus on what the Russians did to interfere in our election,\u201d Schiff said.The controversy surrounding the memo has not deterred Nunes\u2019 investigative efforts, and has exacerbated the partisan acrimony among committee members. Schiff called for Nunes to step down as chairman, while Speaker Paul Ryan has backed his efforts.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/nunes-refused-to-tell-house-intel-whats-next-for-his-doj-fbi-probe?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Julia Arciga", "body": "Asian American advocacy groups are blasting FBI Director Chris Wray for telling Congress that Chinese students in the United States may be covertly gathering intelligence for their government back home.Wray\u2019s comments came during the Senate intelligence committee\u2019s annual open hearing on the greatest threats to the country. A host of Intelligence Community leaders shared a litany of concerns about dangers from around the globe. Then Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, asked Wray about \u201cthe counterintelligence risk posed to U.S. national security from Chinese students, particularly those in advanced programs in science and mathematics.\u201d Wray took it from there. \u201cThe use of non-traditional collectors, especially in the academic setting\u2014whether it\u2019s professors, scientists, students\u2014we see in almost every field office that the FBI has around the country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just in major cities. It\u2019s in small ones as well, it\u2019s across basically every discipline. And I think the level of naivete on the part of the academic sector about this creates its own issues.\u201d What\u2019s more, Wray added, the Bureau is actively investigating some Chinese government-backed groups that facilitate dialogues between Chinese and American academics. It was a rare revelation of active FBI investigations\u2014one that drew pointed criticism from Asian-American advocacy and student groups.OCA-Asian Pacific American Advocates, a group that works on issues related to Asian American and Pacific Islanders, said in a statement that they found Wray\u2019s comments \u201cdishonest and insulting.\u201d \u201cIt is dangerous and irresponsible for him to accuse many individuals seeking a higher education, or to contribute to their field of study, of spying,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHis remarks only further insinuates that Chinese and Chinese Americans continue to be treated racially profiled as perpetual foreigners in the intelligence community,\u201d the statement continued. And Jason Li, who heads Stanford\u2019s Asian American Students Association, also criticized the comments.\u201cWe strongly denounce Director Wray\u2019s comments, which fall in line with a long history of targeting, vilifying, and scapegoating immigrants under the cloak of national security,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cInternational students are our friends, our colleagues, and our family...This overreach of national security harms our communities, and we condemn Wray\u2019s statements in our fight against racial profiling and discrimination.\u201dThe FBI declined to comment on a request for additional details about Wray\u2019s comments. A spokesperson for Rubio did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wray isn\u2019t the first FBI official to raise concerns about Chinese government activity and medical research. Thank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

In some cases, he said, government-backed hackers have stolen health data. But in other cases, Americans give away this data to Chinese government-backed labs that specialize in DNA sequencing and diagnostic tests, You said. American health and academic institutions work with these labs, sharing tens of thousands of Americans\u2019 personal health information with these government-backed entities. He described the situation as \u201ca ticking time bomb.\u201d Rubio spurred Monday\u2019s comments, and said that while the Kremlin poses major threat, China is \u201cthe biggest issue of our time.\u201d It\u2019s a view that\u2019s increasingly common in the Trump administration, which has considered curbing the number of foreign students studying STEM to \u201censure that intellectual property is not transferred to our competitors...such as China.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re exploiting the very open research and development environment that we have, which we all revere,\u201d Wray said in response. \u201cBut they\u2019re taking advantage of this. One of the things we\u2019re trying to do is to view the Chinese threat as not just a whole of government threat, but a whole-of-society threat, on their end. And I think it\u2019s going to take a whole-of-society response by us. It\u2019s not just the Intelligence Community, but it\u2019s raising awareness within our academic sector, within our private sector, as part of defense.\u201dWith foreign students taking up a \u201clarge majority\u201d of graduate STEM enrollment, it seems that the FBI has taken this to be an intelligence risk. Intersections of the academic world and alleged Chinese espionage aren\u2019t unprecedented. In 2015, the Justice Department announced the indictment of six Chinese nationals, including two who met while working on a Defense Department-funded research project as students at a Southern California university. They later stole trade secrets from their employers, which they shared with a university in China, according to the indictment, which said that university went on to use the information to get military contracts. Court filings show the prosecution is underway. \u201cWe understand there is a real threat coming out of China, but expect that top-notched intelligence agencies have better tools to rely on than racial profiling every Chinese person coming to America.\u201d\u2014 John C. YangEspionage isn\u2019t the only concern Rubio and Wray discussed at the hearing. Rubio asked Wray if he worries about the Chinese government-funded Confucius Institutes, which partner with American universities. The senator said one concern, which he recently shared with Institute-partnered universities in Florida, is that these programs aim to covertly change American public opinion on the Chinese government by whitewashing its human rights abuses. Neither Rubio nor Wray went into detail about the Institutes. But the FBI Director said the Bureau has opened investigations into some of them. \u201cWe do share concerns about the Confucius Institutes,\u201d Wray said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been watching that development for a while. It\u2019s just one of many tools that they take advantage of. We have seen some decrease recently in their own enthusiasm and commitment to that particular program, but it is something that we\u2019re watching warily and in certain instances have developed appropriate investigations into them.\u201dJohn C. Yang, who heads Asian Americans Advancing Justice, called the whole interchange an affront to the American way. \u00a0\u201cWe cannot have every Chinese student or scientist assumed guilty until proven innocent of a national security threat,\u201d he said. \u201cWe understand there is a real threat coming out of China, but expect that top-notched intelligence agencies have better tools to rely on than racial profiling every Chinese person coming to America.\u201d", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/fbi-directors-shock-claim-chinese-students-are-a-potential-threat?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matt Lewis", "body": "This may be a problem that only Donald Trump could fix. In the wake of another tragic shooting, both sides of the political spectrum immediately adopt reductionist solutions: For liberals, gun control is the only answer\u2014even though it\u2019s often hard to see how a given law would have prevented a given tragedy. For conservatives, the solution is dealing with mental health (though this often comes across merely as a way to parry the debate, altogether) and arming teachers with guns. \u00a0Anyone who objects to the notion that gun control is the only solution is generally portrayed as evil, uncaring, and a tool of the NRA. Anyone who supports even modest commonsense gun control is either a gun-grabbing fascist, or a patsy who is opening the door for mass gun confiscation. What if both sides have it wrong? What if this is a much more complex problem that will require a combination of overlapping common-sense solutions? And what if we have just the man to make this sales pitch? Ironically, Donald Trump may be the only man who could thread this needle. In doing so, he could gain popularity and cement a lasting legacy. That\u2019s because Trump is viscerally trusted by blue-collar gun owners, a fact that grants him the flexibility to make deals that would brand other Republicans a \u201csellout.\u201d There\u2019s also reason to believe he might actually be philosophically amenable to this. In his past life, the New York billionaire supported moderate gun-control measures. In his 2000 book,\u00a0The America We Deserve, Trump wrote: \u201cI generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.\u201dWhat if Donald Trump was actually serious about championing a comprehensive set of solutions that dealt with the complex causes of this problem? The honest truth is that I suspect there are many factors contributing to the school shooting trend\u2014and that any solution must include a multi-pronged response. \u00a0On one hand, we can look at the fact that other developed countries do not experience these school shootings and draw some conclusions. Some of this may well have to do with some deep-seated cultural differences (American exceptionalism in its worst form, if you like), but our Second Amendment, and the concomitant gun laws, are at least a part of the equation. But it seems to me that any sincere effort to actually address this problem (as opposed to scoring political points) and gain enough votes to actually pass something would involve: (a) some form of common sense gun control; (b) the ability for parents and authorities to force a child to obtain mental treatment, and for law enforcement to monitor (and in the most serious cases, detain) those deemed truly dangerous; (c) dramatically increased security at schools (and I\u2019m open to teachers packing heat\u2014but that\u2019s not the only option); (d) a public information campaign aimed at preserving a strong family structure\u2014and raising awareness about parent\u2019s responsibilities to report behavior that is spinning out of control; (e) policies that empower the police and F.B.I. actually follow protocols and aggressively pursue tips\u2014as well as severe punishments for officers who fail to investigate; (f) stronger efforts to stop school bullying; \u00a0(g) a serious effort to voluntarily curb, shame, or censor violent entertainment aimed at children\u2014particularly violent \u201cshooter\u201d games.Thank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Could this actually get done?I should probably concede that I thought Donald Trump had a similar opportunity to tap into the \u201cOnly Nixon can go to China\u201d narrative by backing a compromise immigration reform agenda. The fact that four different immigration bills failed to make it out of the Senate on Thursday does not bode well for those of us who want to believe that our political system is still not broken. And this issue is actually much harder to fix than immigration. There are good reasons why it\u2019s almost impossible to fix any of the fundamental problems that are leading to this crisis. Any change to gun laws has to comport with our Second Amendment rights, and would have to overcome objections that it is a stepping stone to confiscation. Moreover, conservatives may say they want to empower law enforcement to intervene in the case of someone struggling with mental problems, but this is in tension with our \u201cBig Brother\u201d fears and our libertarian impulses. Mistakes, no doubt, would be made. \u00a0Do we really want to empower loved ones to have us committed just because we\u2019re going through some weird \u201cGoth\u201d stage in middle school? The notion of censoring violent entertainment sounds similarly anti-American and prudish (see Tipper Gore). And the idea that schools should have metal detectors would be a tacit admission that we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore. Likewise, the idea that teachers should be armed to the teeth seems simultaneously dystopian and laughable\u2014even though it\u2019s an idea any parent who has been told an active shooter is on campus would immediately support. I guess the question is: Do we really want to get serious about this, or not? What\u2019s the alternative? Wait until he next school shooting?Our greatest hope for action may be that it would be in Trump\u2019s self-interest (whether he knows it, or not) to actually fix some of our problems.At the risk of sounding clich\u00e9d, because his biggest backer was the NRA, Trump could also have a \u201cSister Souljah\u201d moment. I know what Bill Clinton would do here, but Donald Trump has shown no inclination to move beyond his base\u2014even if it meant pleasing the general public.It won\u2019t be easy. But (ironically) America has elected the guy who could possibly get it done\u2014if he only cared to. \u00a0The sad truth is that I don\u2019t expect anything to happen. This cynicism is a product of experience. The smart political analysis is to say that if Newtown couldn\u2019t get people to take this serious, what will? There are a million reasons why this hasn\u2019t gotten done these last 20 years, but as a father of two school-aged children, there are two really big reasons I want this fixed now.

If the administration didn\u2019t issue an emergency order keeping its power plants open, Murray Energy would soon suffer the same fate, the letter said. \u201cTheir bankruptcy will force Murray Energy Corporation into immediate bankruptcy, promptly terminating our 6,500 coal mining jobs,\u201d he wrote.Two weeks after that letter, and ten days after its America First Policies contribution, Murray wrote to Energy Secretary Rick Perry. He estimated that a failure to prop up FirstEnergy would cost his company more than $4 billion. In fact, he said, \u201cno other viable alternative\u2026will stop the certain collapse of much of the thermal coal industry.\u201dThe Trump administration rebuked the company, and declined to issue the order that Murray sought. But Murray ended up finding a lifeline elsewhere.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on Tuesday that he would \u201cvery much like to\u201d merge those two efforts. And the appetite among the rest of the caucus for doing so is surprisingly strong, aides and lawmakers say..\u201cI\u2019m keenly supporting those pieces of legislation and I think the continued arrows shot at the department and the knowledge that they took one run at Mueller already is a sign that we need to find a way to get this done,\u201d Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) told The Daily Beast. \u201cI agree with any strategy that helps get it done. That\u2019s the prime goal.\u201dSen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), a co-sponsor of one measure to shield Mueller, told The Daily Beast that the party should do \u201canything we can do to get this done as quickly as possible.\u201dBut such a strategy does not come without risks. Democrats have few, if any, levers to force Republicans to add legislation shielding Mueller into a government funding bill. And if the GOP chooses not to do so, Schumer would have to either accept defeat or choose not provide the votes needed to keep the government open until it is included.\u201cI think we need to think carefully about how we\u2019re approaching it. My priority is to get the funding bill done,\u201d Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) told The Daily Beast, expressing concern that a political fight over shielding Mueller could imperil ongoing budget talks.Democratic aides stressed on Tuesday that no lawmaker was considering, let alone advocating for, a strategy that would use the threat of a shutdown to force consideration of the special counsel protection legislation. The conversation, one aide said, was merely about mounting an aggressive campaign to encourage GOP officials to consider placing that legislation in a government funding bill.But even that push has potential downsides. As one aide noted, it could complicate efforts to present the legislation\u2014which has Republican co-sponsors\u2014as being the product of bipartisan consideration and concern.\u201cOne thing I will say is a strong issue is we don\u2019t want this to be seen as a Democratic thing,\u201d said the Senate Democratic aide. \u201cThe second it ends up on a Democratic wish list for negotiations we fell like it is an unhelpful place to be.\u201dIn addition to exploring how to leverage a government-funding fight, Democrats are also considering other avenues for elevating the Mueller-shielding legislation. Some ideas are more dramatic than others, including a proposal to have a member launch a filibuster-like speech on the floor to tout the necessity of legislation. \u201cThe only way you get it into law is to put a spotlight on it,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, President Barack Obama\u2019s former communications director. \u201cWhat you need to do is get Republicans on the record and force them to say they are for it or not. But the only way to do that is to make it an issue.\u201dSuch an idea has been executed before, notably by Senator Rand Paul (R-KY.) when he spoke for 13 hours straight about America\u2019s drone policy. \u201cReally you just need someone who has strong legs and a large bladder,\u201d said Pfeiffer.

Instead, the party is also looking into making a heightened push to force a merger of the two existing bills\u2014which are still being reconciled\u2014 through the Senate Judiciary Committee and on to the Senate floor.Democrats feel as if they may be able to push a bill through that committee since the chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), has held a hearing on the matter and appeared open to supporting it. But the bill would inevitably face a tough path forward through the Senate. On Tuesday, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) declared that he saw no need for the legislation, even amid recent reports that Trump ordered that Mueller be fired last June, only to be talked down by his White House counsel, Don McGahn. Both pieces of legislation were introduced in August amid Trump\u2019s suggestions that the special counsel was conducting an unfair investigation that included his finances. The exact mechanics behind both bills are slightly different, but they both provide a legislative backstop in the event that Mueller\u2014or any special counsel going forward\u2014is removed without cause. Both pieces of legislation also have a Republican co-sponsor\u2014Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.). But in recent weeks Tillis\u2019 enthusiasm for passing a bill has cooled. And aides involved in merging the two pieces of legislation say that progress has been uneven. Democrats had hoped\u2014indeed, assumed\u2014that revelations that Trump had flirted with firing Mueller would compel more Republican lawmakers to support the measures. But the absence of that groundswell has convinced some members that they need to more aggressively demand that their counterparts take a position one way or another. \u201cI have to say I\u2019m really appalled by our Republican colleagues in reference to this,\u201d Schumer said on Tuesday. \u201cThey\u2019ve always been defenders of the FBI and protagonists of Putin, and they seem to have flipped. They remind me of a movie: The Silence of the Lambs. They\u2019re just not saying a thing.

Adam Schiff, claimed after prevailing in a unanimous committee vote on Monday that his document would reveal \u201cmany distortions and inaccuracies in the [Republican] memo.\u201d The vote came hours after Trump taunted Schiff on Twitter. And it was an abrupt reversal for the committee Republicans, all of whom voted against releasing the Democratic document last week\u2014something their Democratic colleagues said was a political stunt to ensure the pro-Trump narrative laid out in the Nunes memo had days to circulate unrebutted. Schiff said Monday night that the Republicans\u2019 transparency rhetoric placed them in an \u201cunsupportable position\u201d to reject the Democratic memo.Much as with last week\u2019s disclosure of Nunes\u2019 memo, Trump now has five days to object to the release of the Democratic counter-memo. Should he, the full House can vote to override Trump and release it. Asked ahead of the Monday committee vote if the FBI had reservations about the release of the Democratic memo, the bureau declined comment. \u201cNunes dodged a question last week from a Democratic colleague as to whether the White House aided in his memo\u2019s creation. He reportedly did the same thing in Monday afternoon\u2019s committee hearing.\u201dNunes\u2019 four-page document, released on Friday after a weeks-long hasthtag campaign, claimed that senior Justice Department and FBI officials manipulated a process for securing court-authorized surveillance against Trump campaign foreign-policy adviser Carter Page. It confirmed that Page had indeed been the subject of foreign-agent surveillance, something intelligence agencies and their oversight committees are typically loath to discuss. Nunes\u2019 memo insinuated that ex-British spy Christopher Steele\u2019s dossier of accusations against Trump aides was the genesis of the Russia investigation that ex-FBI director James Comey has testified began in July 2016. Yet the memo conceded that the surveillance request for Page came later, on October 21, 2016. On its final page, it acknowledged that the \u201copening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation\u201d for the Trump had nothing to do with either Page or Steele, but rather thanks to information concerning a different campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, who is now cooperating with special prosecutor Robert Mueller. Nunes even subsequently conceded that a \u201cfootnote\u201d in the surveillance application for Page indicated that financing for the Steele dossier came from a political entity\u2014 \u2013 undermining another central aspect of the memo\u2019s allegations of FBI and Justice Department misconduct.Once Nunes rejected FBI entreaties to provide additional context, the FBI attacked the memo publicly, saying last Wednesday that Nunes\u2019 narrative contained \u201cmaterial omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo\u2019s accuracy.\u201d The Justice Department called its release \u201cextraordinarily reckless\u201d and said it was \u201cunaware of any wrongdoing\u201d over the Page surveillance. Nunes subsequently admitted he did not read the surveillance application that his memo purported to summarize.The president, for his part, claimed the Nunes memo \u201ctotally vindicates\u201d him, despite its inability to show the centrality of the Steele dossier for a surveillance warrant on Page \u2013 which, in any event, was not the genesis of the FBI investigation into collusion; the Papadopolous information was. Thus far, Trump has not acted on his feelings of vindication and fired deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, a prelude to firing or constraining Mueller. As Republican momentum to release Nunes\u2019 memo intensified, Democrats on the intelligence committee wrote a rebuttal. Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the committee, said on January 24 that the Democratic counter-memo would set \u201cout the relevant facts and exposing the misleading character of the Republicans\u2019 document so that members of the House are not left with an erroneous impression of the dedicated professionals at the FBI\u201d and\u201d the Justice Department.Will Hurd, a Texas Republican on the intelligence committee who joined in the push to release the Nunes memo, stated in a Washington Post op-ed that the Democratic memo \u201cincluded many references that would affect existing intelligence activity.\u201d Through his office, Hurd, a former CIA officer, declined to elaborate, as did numerous Democratic offices contacted for comment. Schiff pledged last week that ahead of any publication of his own memo, \u201cour intention\u201d was to \u201cmake our memoranda, at least, available to the Department of Justice and the FBI, subject to their input and redaction before being made public.\u201d \u00a0Thank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Thus far, Trump has not acted on his feelings of vindication and fired deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, a prelude to firing or constraining Mueller. His White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, has portrayed the White House\u2019s motivations as emerging from simply wanting the truth to come out: \u201cWe've said all along from day one that we want full transparency in this process.\u201d Her deputy on Monday stopped short of expressing White House support for releasing the Democratic memo. According to Schiff, the White House will receive his memo Monday night.During the intelligence committee\u2019s closed hearing last week, an ally of Nunes, Republican Peter King of New York, made a similar argument. \u201cThere are moments in our history when full transparency is required so that all Americans can understand what their government has done,\u201d King said on January 29. Later in that hearing, King, like all his GOP colleagues, voted against releasing the Democratic memo.\u201c\u2018There are moments in our history when full transparency is required,\u2019 the Republican congressman said, just before he voted against releasing the Democratic memo.\u201dAll that \u00a0provided grist last week for Democrats to ready hypocrisy charges concerning their countermemo. \u201cIf President Trump and Congressman Nunes were interested in a full, accurate accounting of why this investigation was launched, they would release Congressman Schiff\u2019s response.\u201d Senator Jack Reed said in a Friday statement. Schiff last week shot back at King behind closed committee doors: \u201cIf it is Mr. King\u2019s position that full transparency is required, certainly full transparency means full transparency, and that would include the minority views as well as the majority views.\u201d Hours before the Monday committee vote, Trump lashed out at \u201cLittle Adam Schiff\u201d as \u201cone of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington\u201d who \u201cmust be stopped!\u201d He subsequently called Nunes \u201ca man of tremendous courage and grit [who] may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero.\u201d Nunes, who has blocked and tackled for Trump from his committee perch for the past year, had previously played a leading role on Trump\u2019s presidential transition team. Nunes dodged a question last week from a Democratic colleague as to whether the White House aided in his memo\u2019s creation. Schiff said Nunes did the same thing in Monday afternoon\u2019s committee hearing, ultimately reading out what Schiff called a \u201clawyerly\u201d prepared statement claiming only that the White House was uninvolved in the drafting of the memo. \u201cThis just looks too much like a rerun of that charade at the beginning of the investigation,\u201d Schiff said. While the committee Democrats solicited \u201cfeedback\u201d from the Justice Department and FBI as to what ought to remain withheld in their memo, Schiff said, the Democrats were concerned Trump would selectively censor its contents in accordance with Trump\u2019s interests.\u201cWe want to make sure the White House does not redact our memo for political purposes and that was a deep concern,\u201d Schiff said.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/your-move-trump-house-intel-oks-release-of-dems-memo?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Gideon Resnick", "body": "Sen.

When CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper asked Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel if his department could have prevented the shooting, Israel answered: \u201cListen, ifs and buts and candy and nuts, O.J. Simpson would still be in the record books.\u201d\n\u201cI don't know what that means,\u201d replied Tapper. Nobody does. What does O.J. Simpson have to do with the price of tea in China (and isn\u2019t he still in the record books)? More to the point, Israel\u2019s flippant reply belies the fact that prosecutors and legal experts told the Miami Herald that the shooter\u2019s \u201ctroubling behavior gave law enforcement plenty of opportunities to investigate and arrest him\u2014and even take away his guns\u2014long before he shot up Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.\u201d What is more, Israel\u2019s weird answer doesn\u2019t comport with reports that at least one of the sheriff\u2019s deputies (and maybe as many as three) waited outside the school during the shooting rampage.\nNow, here\u2019s what I keep expecting to happen: I keep expecting Sheriff Israel to become the scapegoat. I\u2019m not saying he doesn\u2019t deserve serious blame and condemnation (he does). But what I am suggesting is that his incompetence could be used by those who would prefer to do nothing to stem the plague of school shootings to overshadow everything else we should have learned from this whole experience.\nI\u2019m not the only one who suspects that Sheriff Israel is about to become a bogeyman. \u201cNancy Pelosi should watch out,\u201d writes Michael Graham at CBS News. \u201cThe minority leader has a challenger for the GOP's role of favorite Democrat to vilify, and his name is Scott Israel, sheriff of Broward Country.\u201d\nSo far, Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter feed hasn\u2019t turned on Israel. But a few days ago, the president called the deputy who waited outside a \u201ccoward.\u201d On Monday, he continued the attacks, calling him \"frankly, disgusting\u201d and said the other deputies \"weren\u2019t exactly Medal of Honor winners.\" The president has a point, although the notion that Trump would have \u201crun in there even if I didn\u2019t have a weapon\u201d is laughable and unnecessarily shifts attention back to Trump. \nThe danger is that by becoming a convenient foil, Israel makes it possible for people to blame him, call for his dismissal\u2014and postpone making any substantive changes. \nIn the wake of the shooting, I wrote a column outlining a fairly comprehensive reform strategy for preventing the next school shooting. My list included topics such as mental health reform, heightened school security, what I called \u201ccommon sense\u201d gun control (which might include raising the age for buying a rifle to 21, banning bump-stocks, and universal background checks), examining violent culture and entertainment, reducing school bullying, maintaining the family unit, etc. However, it turns out that my ideas aren\u2019t needed\u2014at least, not if you buy into the theory that one bad police department is to blame for this entire tragedy. \nWhat we need are overlapping solutions that serve as a failsafe in case one area (say, law enforcement) drops the ball. We have to have a multi-pronged approach to this complex problem. The best way to ensure that happens is to remember that Sheriff Israel is only one small part of a much bigger problem. \nRevelations of police incompetence also make it less likely that anything bipartisan will happen. Consider Sen. Marco Rubio, who courageously endured booing at a CNN town hall. If the narrative on the right shifts to suggest the shooting was merely the fault of bad policing, he is going to have an even tougher time standing up to the conservative base when it comes to some of the moderate gun control measures he is considering. \u201cWonder if Marco Rubio would still go in national TV and surrender our rights to the rage mob if he knew Scott Israel's credibility would have the shelf life of room temperature cottage cheese,\u201d writes Jesse Kelly, a pro-Second Amendment activist who failed in a bid for Congress to replace Gabby Giffords.\nThanks, Sheriff Israel. \nI\u2019m not saying that we shouldn\u2019t focus on law enforcement\u2019s failures; we should. There\u2019s a pattern with many of these mass shootings and terrorist attacks\u2014red flags are often ignored. Whether it is police incompetence or cowardice, a lack of communication, or bureaucratic red tape that ties the hands of law enforcement, we have to hope that these colossal screw-ups at least result in something positive. \u00a0\nAlong those lines, on Monday, President Trump suggested he was open to \u201cred flag\u201d restraining orders. This idea was championed by conservative writer David French in the wake of the Parkland shooting. French explains that this is a \u201cprocess for temporarily denying a troubled person access to guns\u201d by empowering \u201cfamily members and others close to a potential shooter, allowing them to \u2018do something\u2019 after they \u2018see something\u2019 and \u2018say something.\u2019\u201d It is encouraging that is an idea that would combine concerns about police red tape and also address the mental health aspect of this story. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

But many people felt frustrated as the news weighed on them Monday, asking Russia\u2019s eternal questions: \u201cHow to live on?\u201d and \u201cWho to blame?\u201d\nSome in the opposition fault what they consider a Western obsession with Putin\u2019s alleged skullduggery, from interference in the U.S. presidential elections to the attempted murder in England of ex-spy Sergei Skripal\u2014and perhaps, over the years, more than a dozen other Putin enemies. Even Putin\u2019s detractors\u2014who wouldn\u2019t put such things past him\u2014 say that politically, internally, the attacks on him and on Russia helped turn out the vote in his favor.\nOn Monday, after Putin\u2019s victory, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov embraced that idea. He called the vote an \u201celoquent\u201d response by the Russian people to \u201cattacks\u201d from abroad, adding that sooner or later the U.S. and Europe would \u201cneed to answer for these baseless allegations.\u201d \u00a0\nWith six more years of Putin stretching in front of them, many in the opposition wondered how they\u2019ll survive. \u201cThis is an authoritarian state, there was no election, Putin simply re-appointed himself for six more years but he is not leaving after six years, he is staying forever,\u201d Anton Krasovsky, an adviser to presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak, told The Daily Beast. Sobchak came fourth at Sunday election, winning only 1.5 percent of the vote. \u201cInstead of crying, we should go and work so that in 12 years, when Putin decides to appoint some security officer like Aleksei Dyumin [a former Putin bodyguard reportedly groomed as a successor], we should be there to compete.\u201d\nBloggers suggested various scenarios, including moving abroad, downshifting, escaping into internal immigration, adjusting their views to fit the system. Once again the defeated opposition felt forced to choose between cooperating with the Kremlin or turning into a dissident movement. On Monday morning the Echo of Moscow radio station reminded its listeners that Putin, who makes all the key decisions in the country, could surprise the nation with any sort of radical measures, including a new iron curtain.\nIn the interview with the newspaper Kommersant, the head of the Russian National Security Foundation, Konstantin Simonov, said the Russian president\u2019s decision-making is completely opaque. \u201cPutin is reminiscent of a black box, nobody knows what is going on in his mind, and the most important thing is that he does not allow any leaks,\u201d Simonov said. \u201cSince there is that black box, people discuss, whisper things, make things up for Putin.\u201d \nPublic vibrations\u2014reactions to signals coming from Putin about the course of his thinking\u2014have been a part of Russia\u2019s reality for almost two decades. People try to imagine and believe what they do not know. It\u2019s almost a matter of faith. But serious analysts, even the most brilliant, have grown weary of the guessing game.\nTanya Felgenhauer, one of the most courageous political observers in Moscow, realized she had lost interest in the election turnout as she watched the many violations in the vote count on the Election Day. \u201cI have no emotions whatsoever for any aspect of that vote. Nothing. Total indifference,\u201d Felgenhauer wrote in a post on Facebook. \u201cI am not angry, I am not mad, I do not laugh, I am simply indifferent. \u201c\nOn Sunday, Putin promised to start thinking about the new government\u2014and immediately news analysts smelled intrigue. Some said that Putin was planning to fire Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, others believed that the President was going to keep his old friend and partner in place. Putin\u2019s inauguration is in May, so Russia has two months to roll this lollipop around in the mouth.\nOn Sunday evening, Putin seemed happy enough with his record score. In spite of the opposition\u2019s calls to boycott the presidential election, 67.5 percent of the electorate showed up at the polls.

Both films have lavish action sequences in the overblown style of Michael Bay. Both were massive commercial successes. The former is the highest-grossing Chinese film ever.\nWith the archetype of the Chinese Savior firmly established, attitudes within China are showing a lack of racial sensitivity at best, and a sense of superiority over other races at worst. \n\n\u201cA gala show on state television included a skit that involved an Asian woman in blackface and oversized butt pads and an African actor in a monkey suit.\u201d\n\nIn an infamous incident last month during the Chinese New Year break, a gala show on state television included a skit that involved an Asian woman in blackface and oversized butt pads and an African actor in a monkey suit. Criticisms of the skit were censored. In 2016, an advertisement for a laundry product showed a black man being shoved into a washing machine, only to emerge as a boyish-looking Asian man\u2014with skin of a much lighter hue.\nMoving off-screen, we can see those attitudes play out in Guangzhou\u2019s Little Africa, derogatively called \u201cChocolate City\u201d by locals. Once a vibrant hub where traders from Guinea, Mali, Nigeria, and other African nations gathered or even settled, the neighborhood has been \u201cbeautified\u201d by the city government: street markets that once were abuzz with commerce and camaraderie have been banned; the police maintain a constant presence, checking the passports and visas of the foreigners they encounter; locals often hold the mistaken belief that these outsiders are involved with drug trafficking or prostitution. Many shops have been shuttered. \nAlthough Little Africa was once estimated to be the temporary home of over 100,000 people, few Africans walk its streets now. Sections of the once culturally diverse neighborhood have been paved over to build parking lots and erect pristine residential units; often, the new landlords will not allow Africans to sign a lease.\nA 2008 diplomatic cable obtained by Wikileaks suggests that a decade ago local authorities were \u201cextremely concerned about the high degree of concentration of Africans into a few Guangzhou neighborhoods.\u201d \nThe many entrepreneurs who sought their fortunes by obtaining cheap, sometimes fake, goods in the Pearl River Delta region and shipping them home have been displaced.

Even if they once saw China\u2019s rise as a model to emulate, and came to trade, learn, and grow, a flight back home now seems like the only option.\nChina\u2019s exploitative relationship abroad with African nations became most evident earlier this year. In late January, the French daily Le Monde reported that the Chinese government\u2019s gift of a headquarters building and computer network for the African Union in Addis Ababa contained a back door to facilitate the transfer of data to servers in Shanghai. \nChina\u2019s ambassador to the AU, Kuang Weilin, responded to allegations that China is spying on the AU by calling the findings \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cpreposterous.\u201d\nThe myth of Chinese support for African nations has been perpetuated both at home and abroad, with the $200 million AU complex in Addis as the crown jewel within the narrative of international cooperation fostered by Chinese public funds. But the charm in Beijing\u2019s Africa blitz doesn\u2019t hide the profiteering and wrangling for influence that follow. \nJust next door to Ethiopia, China\u2019s move into Djibouti is a prime example. The tiny east African nation sits along one of the world\u2019s major maritime shipping lanes, and is home to American, French, German, Italian, and Japanese military bases, with the latest addition of a Chinese \u201clogistics and supply center\u201d to the many foreign military installations already there. The Chinese naval facility was inaugurated last summer, and is part of Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s plan to modernize his country\u2019s military, expanding its navy\u2019s blue-water capabilities. \n\n\u201cThe Chinese government\u2019s gift of a headquarters and computer network for the African Union in Addis Ababa contained a back door to facilitate the transfer of data to servers in Shanghai.\u201d\n\u2014 Le Monde\n\nBeijing shells out $20 million a year to lease the real estate for its base in Djibouti, and has already stationed over 1,000 troops there, with sufficient space for 10 times that number if needed. On top of that, the Chinese government has given the host nation loans topping $1.1 billion to upgrade its commercial port, build an additional airport, a railway that stretches to Addis Ababa, and a water pipeline that moves water from Ethiopia. \nSome Djibouti officials have expressed concern about their country\u2019s ability to repay those loans\u2014failure to channel funds back to China would place the nation in an undesirable position in the very near future.\nOver in Kenya, controversy is unfolding around the country\u2019s largest infrastructure project since its 1963 independence. A Chinese-built railway has been designed to be extended through the wildlife reserve just outside of Nairobi. A court ordered that construction be halted as the case is reviewed, but builders and engineers from the China Road and Bridge Corporation have already begun work, with protection from armed guards.\nThe ranking member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Jack Reed, has already warned of China\u2019s influence in African nations. After a recent trip to the region, he said, \u201cWherever we\u2019re going in Africa, they seem to be there, or following close behind.\u201d Under a messy Trump administration, American policy has failed to keep up with the actions of the Eastern superpower. It isn\u2019t even clear whether America aims to cooperate with China on the continent, counter its clout, or implement a combination of the two options.\nBeijing\u2019s goals, however, are much clearer. Chinese industrialists\u2014often with the state\u2019s backing\u2014are eyeing their moves to a new continent as the economic and governance models at home switch gears. \nEthiopia, for instance, has received a cash injection of nearly $11 billion to bulk up its industrial infrastructure, transforming farmland into industrial parks that can house factories that churn out fast fashion clothing items and consumer electronic goods. The country has opened four such parks since 2014, and plans to launch eight more before 2020. Hundreds of Ethiopian farmers have complained of land grabs, displacement, and lack of compensation, as the government clears space for newcomers from Beijing.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how many Friendship Bridges are built, or how many Cooperation Summits are organized.

Those suspects are still being sought.\nThe recovered bomb package, put together with funds provided by ISIS, reportedly included more than eight pounds of C4 and another 12 pounds of dynamite, and would have been used as part of a suicide strike.\nGuti\u00e9rrez had already obtained work as a dishwasher at the targeted cafeteria in order to pull off the attack, which was scheduled for mid-March, before police intervened.

At his arraignment, Guti\u00e9rrez said that he is now dedicated to battling American power and the \u201cnew world order,\u201d according to the Associated Press.\nWhen a Colombian journalist asked him to elaborate on his animosity for Uncle Sam, Guti\u00e9rrez answered, \u201cFor the same reason we all hate them\u2014because they are thieves and conquerors and killers.\u201d\nCESED\u2019s Zuleta speculated that the attack \u201cmay have been planned [for the Bogota embassy] since Colombia has been the most constant ally of the U.S. in the region.\u201d \nZuleta also said certain anti-Latino remarks made by President Donald Trump could have added fuel to the Cuban zealot\u2019s fire:\n\u201cI do believe that Trump's speech and some of his policies generate an increase in anti-gringo sentiment,\u201d he said. \u201cCalling Latinos \u2018bad hombres.\u2019 talking about how they entrap America, \u200b\u200band building walls generates a sense of enmity.\u201d\nNew Recruits\nAlthough other terror groups sponsored by Iran and Hezbollah are known to operate in South America, this marks the first known incursion into Colombia by ISIS. Unfortunately, it likely won\u2019t be the last.\n\u201cLatin America would allow a new ISIS branch a ready opportunity to generate illicit revenues and gain access to military type weaponry, given the narcotics production and smuggling opportunities that exist and with all the armed criminal groups running around with infantry arms,\u201d said Dr. Robert Bunker, of the Strategic Studies Institute at the U.S. Army War College, in an interview.\nBunker pointed out that the region is home to large swaths of \u201cessentially lawless regions\u201d that provide \u00a0\u201cbad actors a certain level of impunity of action.\u201d\nIn fact, would-be bomber Guti\u00e9rrez had been twice deported from Colombia in the past, most recently returning illegally through the nation\u2019s porous southern border with Ecuador.\n\u201c[ISIS] recruitment could be conducted in these zones as well as within slums and jungle areas no longer under governmental control in various regions,\u201d Bunker said.\nDr. Anne Speckhard, director of the International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism (ICSVE), told The Daily Beast that ISIS has its \u201cslick\u201d recruitment tactics down to a science, in large part due to the \u201cimmediate feedback mechanisms\u201d on social media.\nISIS touts can \u201cwatch for who liked, retweeted, shared and otherwise endorsed their materials to identify, and hone in on, and even swarm those individuals for recruitment,\u201d Speckhard said. \nWhen they find someone who likes their materials, ISIS recruiters seek \u201cat first to interest them more, sometimes \u2018love bomb\u2019 them with attention, meet their needs (as most cults do) and eventually overtake them.\u201d\nAntipathy for the U.S., such as that expressed by Guti\u00e9rrez, can also be a flag for terrorist headhunters.\n\u201cISIS has been very good at attracting those with underlying issues to its message of hatred for the West,\u201d said Speckhard, whose ICSVE is actively engaged in producing an anti-ISIS counter narrative, in part by employing terrorists who have defected.\n\u201cCubans have suffered a lot under their government and U.S. anti-Cuban policies [which feeds into] the ISIS message of the West trampling on the rights of other minority communities. ISIS has also used mentally ill people in a similar manner,\u201d Speckhard said. \u00a0\n\u201cIntelligence Work Can Be Useless\u201d\nOutside the Colombian courthouse last week, Guti\u00e9rrez claimed that others would pick up the struggle where he left off. In spite of his arrest, he said, the \u201cseed has been planted.\u201d\nOne strategy to keep that seed from growing into a tree of hate is addressing the root causes of terrorism worldwide, such as poverty and a lack of infrastructure.\nA \u201chearts and minds approach\u201d aimed at stopping the spread of ISIS in Latin America \u201cwould have to be focused [on] educational and economic opportunities [and] basic security[,] so that human rights and liberties can be protected,\u201d in impoverished areas, Bunker said. \nHe also advocated beefed up information gathering, while acknowledging such steps can be limited in the vast wilderness and unmonitored borderlands of South Am\u00e9rica.\n\u201cAn early warning capability derived from HUMINT (human intelligence) networks of agents and informants is always preferred,\u201d he said, \u201cbut is not always a realistic option in some of these scenarios.\u201d \nColombian security expert Zuleta agreed that the Guti\u00e9rrez case highlights the problem of preventing backdoor infiltration of the Americas by ISIS:\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult because there is no radical Muslim community here, and because the [Cuban] terrorist was not Muslim,\u201d Zuleta said, \u201cthis indicates that intelligence work can be useless.\u201d\nICSVE director Speckhard is concerned that the attempted attack in Colombia could be a sign of things to come.\n\u201cWe should expect that ISIS will use mentally and emotionally unstable people as well as true believers in their cause to attack in the West using handguns, vehicles and anything readily available to mount simple but lethal attacks,\u201d she said. \n\u201cThis keeps the brand going and continues to attract more recruits.\u201d", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-isis-terror-plot-to-kill-us-diplomats-in-colombia?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Betsy Woodruff", "body": "A firm helmed by the man who helped run the Republican Party\u2019s efforts\u00a0in Israel is doing lobbying work for an anti-Semitic foreign strongman without registering as an agent of an overseas power.\nTransparency watchdogs called it a likely violation of the rules governing foreign lobbying\u2014the kind of rules that former Trump campaign boss Paul Manafort and Rick Gates were recently indicted for breaking.

Though federal law requires that lobbyists alert the Justice Department within 10 days when they sign to work for a foreign government, Sanitas waited months to give notice. According to a filing with the Justice Department, Harvin signed with BSI on Oct. 3, 2017, but didn\u2019t alert the Department of Justice until March 7, 2018 (PDF). \nThat belated filing is also missing information it\u2019s mandated to include. While it says BSI is paying Harvin, it doesn\u2019t say how much and when. And it doesn\u2019t say how the Hungarian government is paying BSI, which is headed by Brot, who ran get-out-the-vote operations in Israel for the Republican Party. Both pieces of information are required by law, though it\u2019s unclear how the Justice Department may enforce these rules.\nAdditionally, BSI isn\u2019t registered with the Justice Department at all\u2014even though Sanitas\u2019 filings say that BSI is working for a foreign government to influence policymakers in the United States. BSI is incorporated in Delaware. \nLydia Dennett\u2014an investigator for the Project on Government Oversight, a Washington, D.C., watchdog group\u2014said BSI\u2019s failure to register may be illegal. \n\u201cIt seems very clear that this would be captured by the law,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there\u2019s just enough of a gray area or squishiness in the language that it\u2019s not 100 percent certain.\u201d\nVirginia Canter, executive branch ethics counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said she shared that concern. \n\u201cThey are signing this document on behalf of Hungary,\u201d she said of BSI. \u201cSo it seems to me that that they didn\u2019t register raises questions as to whether or not they\u2019re an unregistered foreign agent.\u201d\nThe filings were first reported by Atlatszo, a Hungarian news site. \nA spokesperson for BSI Public Affairs said the company did not register with the Justice Department through its Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) database because it has not yet started lobbying. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\n\u201cBSI did not register under FARA for the simple reason that it was providing only strategic advice to Hungary internally and has not (yet) represented as an agent or otherwise acted on behalf of Hungary or any of its officials, agencies or instrumentalities before the U.S. Executive Branch, Congress, any other agency of the U.S. Government, nor has BSI acted to disseminate information on Hungary\u2019s behalf to the American public,\u201d said Marc Zell, counsel for BSI. \nIn a statement provided to The Daily Beast, Sanitas said it strives to comply with FARA requirements and that the issues with its filing were because of closing out a past account. \n\u201cThis process was further delayed because Sanitas was required to update several corporate documents, which were required to file along with a new initial registration statement,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAgain, we have worked with FARA throughout this process and an explanation of the delayed filing was detailed in a cover letter filed with the initial registration statement last week. We are also in the later stages of filing an amendment to the initial filing, which details outreach made, as well as the compensation received for our efforts.\u201d \nThe statement also said that Sanitas is not a lobbying firm and did not provide \u201cany stakeholder outreach in the U.S.\u201d The firm\u2019s FARA filings, however, say it was retained to do \u201c[o]utreach to U.S. media and government officials,\u201d to foster \u201ccloser cooperation with the United States,\u201d and to strengthen ties with Western government officials. \nThe Hungarian Embassy in the U.S. did not respond to a comment request. \nHarvin has done unpaid volunteer advance work for Vice President Mike Pence when he travels. He was also a spokesperson for Trump during the transition, according to the Orlando Sentinel. \nBSI Public Affairs, meanwhile, appears to be well-connected in Israeli politics; Walla! News reported in January that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked Brot to be his spokesman. During the 2016 campaign, Brot (whose name is also sometimes transliterated to Brut or Barot) ran the Republican Party\u2019s efforts to get votes of the 300,000-odd U.S. citizens who live in Israel. According to YNetNews, Trump won three quarters of their votes. Brot is close to Israel\u2019s right-wing Likud Party, per Haaretz. \nBefore special counsel Bob Mueller\u2019s probe kicked off, firms that violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act rarely if ever faced legal action.

Breitbart News frequently praises Orb\u00e1n\u2019s \u201canti-globalist, conservative government,\u201d and he is arguably the continent\u2019s most powerful voice against helping migrants and refugees. Orb\u00e1n presents himself as the Trump of Central Europe, and all but endorsed Trump in the 2016 election. \nOn Thursday, Orb\u00e1n gave a speech in Budapest that blamed a stateless people group with connections to the financial industry\u2014centuries-old codewords for Jews\u2014for the country\u2019s struggles. \n\u201cWe are fighting an enemy that is different from us,\u201d he said, according to Shaun Walker of The Guardian. \u201cNot open, but hiding; not straightforward but crafty; not honest but base; does not believe in working but speculates with money; does not have its own homeland but feels it owns the whole world.\u201d\nMany human rights advocates say Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government has made the country less free. \n\u201cTo a large degree, the Hungarian government is lobbying to deflect criticism of its growing repression of dissent,\u201d said Daniel Balson of Amnesty International. \nHe said that Orb\u00e1n\u2019s criticism of billionaire financier and philanthropist George Soros has anti-Semitic overtones, that the media environment in Hungary is becoming increasingly repressive, and that Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party is looking to dramatically curtail the ability of charities and civil society organizations to help migrants fleeing violence in the Middle East. \n\u201cOn human rights, the Hungarian government has been going in the wrong direction, and through its resolute inaction on these issues, the Trump administration has really been abating its slide,\u201d Balson added. \u201cThe Hungarian government certainly wants to keep it that way and deflect any criticism of its growing human rights violations from being raised in Congress.\u201d\nAnd to do that, you need lobbyists.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/watchdogs-gops-man-in-israel-illegally-lobbied-for-anti-semite?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Michael Tomasky", "body": "Two items in Monday\u2019s news cycle show us different but complementary sides of what the Republican Party is doing to this country what Donald Trump did to Stormy Daniels, except without the bribe. Alas, they also show us why it can be so hard for Democrats and liberals to explain the truth to people.Item one is infrastructure. As you\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s \u201cInfrastructure Week.\u201d Again. The last time the White House declared it Infrastructure Week, it actually ended up being War on James Comey week. So who knows, maybe this will end up being Defend Wifebeaters Week.But for now anyway, it\u2019s Infrastructure Week. So the Trump proposal is billed as being a \u201c$1.5 trillion\u201d plan. But it\u2019s actually a $200 billion plan, in terms of commitment of federal money. The rest is supposed to come from state and local governments, which are broke, and the private sector, which will only build highways it can make money on through tolls. It\u2019s a joke. It\u2019s a joke on the American people. There\u2019s one way to finance infrastructure that\u2019s far, far better than all the others. Doesn\u2019t require this game-playing, this lying. Raise the gas tax. May I say it again? Raise the gas tax.The federal gas tax is 18.4 cents a gallon. It hasn\u2019t been raised since 1993. The raise was tucked into Bill Clinton\u2019s first budget\u2014the one, you may remember, that not a single Republican in either house of Congress voted for. It was a big budget bill, so they had many other reasons to vote against it, but the gas tax increase loomed large. When he ran for president in 1996, Bob Dole even campaigned on repealing the modest \u201993 increase.Why is the gas tax the right mechanism to fund infrastructure? Well, because it\u2019s chiefly the gas tax that fills the coffers of the Federal Highway Trust Fund, and logically enough, it\u2019s through the Federal Highway Trust Fund that we do most of our spending on highways (and bridges, and even mass transit, too). And it\u2019s broke. Broke, broke, broke.If the gas tax had been indexed to inflation in 1993, it would be 31 cents today, and we\u2019d be in far better shape. But it wasn\u2019t and we\u2019re not. And it\u2019s all pretty much one man\u2019s fault. Grover Norquist and his awful anti-tax pledge that nearly every Republican in Congress has signed makes it impossible to pass a tax increase. Republicans won\u2019t even discuss it.As it happens, Democrat Chuck Schumer last fall also came out against a gas tax increase, while speaking to my Beast colleague Sam Stein. Schumer believes infrastructure can be paid for through repatriation of tax dollars that we\u2019ve let flow overseas. Maybe. But I was chagrined to read this because, in addition to just getting the money in a clean and simple way, a gas tax increase would also help break the back of the pledge. Democratic priorities aren\u2019t going to do very well on Capitol Hill until they beat the pledge. It\u2019s been enormously destructive.But\u2014and here\u2019s why this is a tough one for Democrats politically\u2014it\u2019s hard for them to say this. I can say whatever I want. I write a column, I\u2019m not seeking votes. But those seeking votes feel they still have to be careful about being for a tax. And it\u2019s true, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m enthusiastic about asking working people to pay more at the pump. But it\u2019s been 25 years. Here\u2019s a timeline of gas tax increases. There was one 24-year interregnum, from 1959 to 1983. This one is now the longest.So while a tax increase is verboten at the federal level, what\u2019s happening instead? States are raising their gas taxes! Because they\u2019re broke, and they need to fix roads. Since 2012, more than half the states have raised gas taxes, and look at which ones: Alaska, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arizona, Texas, and Alabama are among the biggest tax hikers.Trump administration officials, interestingly, say they\u2019re open to a gas tax hike. But they say that in part because they know it\u2019ll never happen. And it\u2019s also an admission that they know their financing is a scam. If it weren\u2019t, why would they need to be open to more funding mechanisms in the first place?So that\u2019s item number one. Even if they pass something, it won\u2019t come close to doing the needed job. It\u2019s a pretend bill.

The CFPB has saved consumers trillions of dollars in various forms of usury and outright robbery. Trump named his OMB director, Mick Mulvaney, the interim head of the CFPB. Mulvaney, a former congressman, has long been on record as hating the bureau.NPR\u2019s Chris Arnold got his hands on a memo saying that the bureau will now \u201cfulfill its statutory responsibilities but go no further.\u201d It adds that the bureau should act \u201cwith humility and moderation.\u201dSo now the CFPB will stop pursuing a case against Golden Valley Lending, a notorious payday lender. Arnold\u2019s report named a Detroit woman who borrowed about $900 from Golden Valley and ended up paying the firm $3,735. In other cases it charged people as much as 950 percent interest.Question: Who could possibly be against a government agency preventing shyster companies from charging people 900 percent interest? Seriously. Who could be against that? No ideology supports that. It\u2019s criminal activity. There is no remote \u201cconservative\u201d basis for defending this. No actual, honest conservative could oppose this. But we know that someone who took $62,000 from the payday lending industry could, since Congressman Mulvaney did.But here\u2019s the kicker, and why I say it\u2019s hard to get the truth out. That Detroit woman above? She voted for Trump. \u201cTo be honest I\u2019m really mad, really pissed, because I actually voted for Trump,\u201d Julie Bonenfant says. \u201cSo knowing that his guy threw out this case that affects people like me, I feel kind of like stupid\u2014just kind of like betrayed.\u201dWell, Julie, I sympathize with your situation, I do. And I hate to say it, but you should feel a little stupid. The Republican Party is the party of payday lenders. Has been for years.

From there, Wolf had until this Thursday to to tell the state Supreme Court whether he approved of the map; and if he did, it would be enacted. Citing a number of nonpartisan analysts on Tuesday, however, Wolf said: \u201cLike the 2011 map, the map submitted to my office by Republican leaders is still a gerrymander. Their map clearly seeks to benefit one political party, which is the essence of why the court found the current map to be unconstitutional.\"This quick process, reshaping the heavily gerrymandered districts of Pennsylvania that had favored Republicans for years, all began on January 22. On that day, the state\u2019s Supreme Court decided that the current Republican-drawn map was unconstitutional and set in motion a multiple-week sprint to redraw all of the state\u2019s 18 districts. Republicans in the state were initially not thrilled with this new task. They appealed their own state\u2019s court ruling to the Supreme Court to try to get them to delay the mandated redrawing. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito denied the request this week without even referring it to the entirety of the court. What\u2019s more is that Joseph Scarnati, the top Republican in Pennsylvania\u2019s Senate, said he was going to refuse the court order to redraw the map. And another top Republican, Rep. Cris Dush, went as far as to say he wanted Democrats on the state\u2019s highest court to be impeached. Amid all of this chaos, Gov. Wolf remained nonplussed as he attempted to hear the input of his colleagues and citizens around the state. \u201cMy job is to figure out what a fair map is,\u201d he told The Daily Beast in an interview last week in the Harrisburg State Capitol. \u201cAnd I have a team of people including a mathematician from Tufts, mapmakers, people who will know\u2014be able to help me figure out whether as objectively as possible, this is a fair map.\u201dLast week, Wolf also toured the state to hear what his constituents would specifically want out of a new map. He described an active audience that was engaged and ready to have a redrawing that made more sense\u2014instead of districts that are not contiguous and carved into oblong shapes.\u201cPeople are fed up and very cynical about all the things that people have done over the years to manipulate our democracy,\u201d Wolf said.

We\u2019re also here to make sure that this democratic system, this system of self-government, continues to evolve, develop and get better.

In a no less dramatic live address to the nation (usually saved for instances of real war), the prime minister pleaded his innocence, claiming not only that his goal always is the \u201cfuture and security of the State of Israel\u201d and \u201cthe good of the country,\u201d but that the entire police investigation was a political witch-hunt meant to topple him.In a tactic familiar to those observing the White House, Netanyahu has thrown the integrity of the police into doubt, going so far as to call for the investigation of the investigators investigating him. In this 2017-2018 annus absurdum, life in Israel doesn\u2019t so much imitate art as it imitates Donald Trump. And yet, in the Israeli system, it\u2019s not the police that issue indictments, but the Attorney General. The police investigate, questioning witnesses and gathering evidence, after which they summarize the case and decide whether an evidentiary basis exists to move forward with an indictment. This summation is then transferred to the State Prosecutor (the body tasked with trying a criminal case) and the Attorney General. The police conclusions are therefore referred to as \u201crecommendations\u201d based on the police\u2019s judgement, and not legally binding. \u00a0Binding or not, though, what do the police conclude happened in the two major Netanyahu corruption probes?In the first, \u201cCase 1000\u201d as the police call it, Netanyahu is alleged to have received expensive gifts\u2014including high-end cigars, Champagne, and jewelry totaling 1 million shekels (nearly $300,000)\u2014from Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire James Packer. The police now allege that in return for this lavish quid, Netanyahu worked to provide financially beneficial quos \u00a0to Milchan in particular: \u00a0tax breaks possibly worth millions of dollars in total, a renewed U.S. visa, and the introduction of three other business schemes that would be helpful to Milchan.Aside from the size of the gifts, the major police revelation was arguably the tax break provision that Netanyahu pursued\u2014again, allegedly on behalf of Milchan\u2014as well as the fact that the quantity of the gift giving increased dramatically once Netanyahu took office nearly a decade ago.The second case, \u201cCase 2000,\u201d is allegedly a straight favor-trading gambit between Netanyahu and the publisher of Yediot Aharonot, a local mass-circulation daily. Recordings surfaced last year of conversations between the prime minister and the publisher negotiating better coverage for Netanyahu in return for legislation and other moves favorable to Yediot\u2019s bottom line. Here, the major police revelation was arguably that Netanyhau convened a meeting of several parliamentarians in order to move these plans forward, indicating the seriousness of his intentions\u2014not just the usual minor backroom dealings between politicians and the media. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Netanyahu, for his part, has publicly rejected the accusations, oftentimes in painstaking detail, calling the police recommendations a \u201cbiased document, extreme, riddled like Swiss cheese and doesn\u2019t hold water.\u201d Netanyahu claims that in the first case, gifts are permitted between \u201cclose family friends\u201d\u2014one lawyer advising the prime minister even called them \u201cbrothers\u201d\u2014and that he in fact \u201cworked against Milchin\u2019s interests\u201d in many of the alleged instances. In the second case, Netanyahu claims that the deal with the publisher was clearly never consummated: Yediot\u2019s fervently anti-Netanyahu editorial line remained, and Netanyahu per his interpretation called snap elections precisely in order to torpedo legislation meant to diminish the power of a rival daily (owned by yet another billionaire Netanyahu friend, Sheldon Adelson).So why does this mind-numbing minutiae matter? Because politically and legally, Netanyahu and his allies have masterfully sown doubt about the exact details of the allegations and the individual police officers making the allegations. Vast left-wing conspiracies involving the media, police, and opposition parties have been proffered, with several Likud parliamentarians calling it an \u201cattempted legal putsch\u201d against a democratically-elected government. For their past, opposition lawmakers allege, with reason, that this is precisely \u201chow criminals talk.\u201d Whether you believe one side or the other usually comes down, at bottom, to your political allegiance.Inexplicably, the police commissioner, Roni Alsheich, a mustachioed former intelligence officer, chose to waddle into this polarized swamp, giving a wide-ranging television interview last week. Alsheich stated that the police had evidence that \u201cpowerful elements\u201d had sent private investigators to gather dirt on officers involved in the Netanyahu probe. That would be like special counsel Robert Mueller allowing 60 Minutes to interview him in real-time about the ongoing Trump-Russia collusion investigation.Thank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The prime minister immediately made political hay out of Alsheich\u2019s allegations, claiming the investigators couldn\u2019t possibly be objective \u201cif they believed I acted against them.\u201d Oshri Ben-Ishai, a Tel Aviv defense attorney\u2014with experience in both organized crime and party political cases\u2014told The Daily Beast that the police commissioner had made a terrible mistake. He suggested obstruction of justice charges could even be brought against him for speaking out before the police recommendations were made public.\u201cIf the police allegations are true, it would be like if a judge trying a mob case found a grenade outside his home. How would the judge respond? It would have to impact his thinking even if he didn\u2019t know for certain it was that specific gangster,\u201d Ishai said.The smokescreens seem to be paying off for Netanyahu: the immediate danger of the police recommendations \u2013 and the premier\u2019s alleged corrupt dealings \u2013 coming to light and sparking a public outcry have not come to pass. \u00a0All of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition partners quickly closed ranks, saying they would wait patiently for Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit\u2019s decision on the cases. This could take months, with many pointing to this coming fall as the most likely timeframe. Per the Israeli judicial system, Mandelblit must now study the case; make a preliminary decision regarding an indictment; and then allow Netanyahu to present his side of the story at a hearing. Only after that does he makes his official decision.In all likelihood, Netanyahu may be safe in the short-term\u2014all it took was sacrificing the integrity of his law enforcement system and democratic norms. Indeed, he woke up this morning the only prime minister in Israel\u2019s sordid (political) history to remain in office as indictments loomed.Yet this is simply the end of the beginning of Netanyahu\u2019s legal saga, not the beginning of the end. At some point he will have to address the allegations arrayed against him by the police. Legal experts here are divided over what Mandelblit will ultimately decide to do. \u201cUnlike Ehud Olmert, there is no \u2018live money\u2019 involved here,\u201d Ben-Ishai said, referring to Netanyahu\u2019s predecessor as prime minister. Olmert was forced to resign after evidence connected him to envelopes stuffed with cash\u2014he was later found guilty and jailed. \u00a0\u201cWith Netanyahu now, these really are gifts. It\u2019s very dirty, but Mandelblit has to decide that it\u2019s also criminal.\u201d Legal interpretations, and hence the evidentiary details, are crucial. Are there enough witnesses to prove that the prime minister pushed for new tax laws solely because his gift-peddling friend asked him to? Were these gifts material ethical breaches and outright bribes, or simply expensive expressions of affection between two well-heeled friends? Was Netanyahu sincere in passing legislation knee-capping his patron Adelson\u2019s newspaper?The police have responded in the affirmative to all of the above\u2014and more\u2014saying outright that Netanyahu in these dealings \u201cworked against the interests of the state.\u201d It\u2019s now Mandelblit\u2019s turn to provide his own interpretation.In his address to the nation last night, a stern-looking Netanyahu spoke of his many decades \u201cfighting for Israel\u2019s security,\u201d the unending criminal investigations against him going back to the 1990, along with his current line of defense against the police allegations. \u201cAll these efforts, without exception, ended with nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis time, too, things will end with nothing.\u201dHe promised that his government would fulfill its term, and that elections would be held on time late next year. Undermining the power and confidence Netanyahu was attempting to project, every few seconds drops of precipitation fell from an unknown locale between the camera and the podium. It was disorientating for the nation watching at home, yet Netanyahu for his part didn\u2019t seem to notice. A little more time is needed to find out whether he can continue dancing through the raindrops.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/netanyahu-is-trying-to-use-trumps-tactics-to-survive-his-corruption-and-bribery-scandal?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Josh Russell", "body": "A leak of internal data from the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency discovered by The Daily Beast serves as the first confirmation that the Russian troll farm deployed its online agitators on Reddit as part of its campaign to interfere in American politics.\nThe leak also reveals 21 Tumblr accounts, including login credentials, run by the Internet Research Agency (IRA).

Wilson Rodriguez Macarreno was arrested on Thursday morning by police in Tukwila, a Seattle suburb, after calling 911 on an intruder, according to KIRO 7. Police did not arrest the intruder due to a lack of probable cause, The Seattle Times reported, but they arrested Macarreno after discovering a 14-year-old warrant issued for him by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Macarreno has been held at a nearby detention center since Thursday. Macarreno\u2019s lawyer Luis Cortes told The Daily Beast that deportation for his client, a 32-year-old father of three, is a \u201crealistic possibility,\u201d said Cortes. The carpenter fled to the United States 14 years ago to escape violence in Honduras. \u201cHis brother was shot and killed, and one of his friends was chopped up in pieces in El Salvador,\u201d Cortes claimed. In his hometown community, Macareno actively participates in church and helped increase the Spanish-speaking congregation, according to his attorney. Police said they discovered Macarenno\u2019s warrant from 2004 when running his information through the National Crime Information Center database, but \u201cit was later determined that the warrant in question was administrative in nature and that it had been entered in the...database the same way a criminal warrant would have been entered.\u201d Maccarreno\u2019s attorney, Cortes, said his client had a \u201crun in with immigration officials in Texas\u201d in 2004 and received an \u201cin absentia order\u201d from ICE when he missed a court hearing to review his deportation case. According to the American Immigration Council, immigration judges can issue an in absentia order when the government has properly notified undocumented immigrants of their court dates.Cortes said he plans to fight the deportation by trying to reopen the 2004 case and request a hearing before an immigration judge. If the request for a stay of deportation based on merit fails, Macareno \u201cwill be deported back to Honduras in a matter of days,\u201d said Cortes.

And despite overwhelming opposition to the policy as crafted, Congress isn\u2019t likely to send a message to the president legislatively, either.\n\u201cWe ought to push back here. I mean, who are we?\u201d Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), who is seeking to nullify the tariffs legislatively, said in an interview. \u201cI think Republicans and conservatives need to stand up and say, \u2018This is not who we are.\u2019\u201d\nTo Flake\u2019s dismay, GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have suggested that they prefer to work with the administration to narrow the policy, rather than respond legislatively. But other Republicans are warning that without substantive actions now, the administration could impose tariffs on other imports, too\u2014as Congress continues to refuse to exercise some of its most basic constitutional powers under Article I.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been worried about the fact that in a number of areas\u2026 the legislative branch has outsourced its authority, it\u2019s delegated away its power,\u201d Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), who has introduced legislation to scale back presidential authority on trade policy, said in an interview. \u201cWhether it\u2019s this president or another president in the future who will go ahead and impose other tariffs and other trade restrictions on other imports in the future.\u201d\nBut leadership isn\u2019t anxious to bring legislation to the floor, and overcoming a presidential veto would be a difficult feat\u2014especially for this Congress.\n\u201cI think the president is listening to some of the concerns that some of us have voiced,\u201d Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) told The Daily Beast. \u201cAs a practical matter, it would be a struggle to get 60 votes in the Senate, and even more so, 291 in the House. So I think it\u2019s better for us just to have constructive dialogue.\u201d\nOthers warn that stripping a president\u2019s trade authority could set a dangerous precedent. A GOP congressional source told The Daily Beast that House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) was in close contact with Trump to encourage him to narrow the policy such that Mexico and Canada would be exempt from the tariffs. And sources familiar with the tariff process expect that that the new policy would be challenged in court by companies and other entities that would be negatively impacted. These sources pointed out that such lawsuits could be successful because Trump acted under his \u201csection 232\u201d national-security authority to impose tariffs\u2014even though the stated reasons for the tariffs have nothing to do with national security.\nBut Congress\u2019 hesitance to push back more forcefully against the Trump administration on trade policy underscores a broader reluctance to exercise its constitutional powers to curtail executive authority. Despite widespread concerns among Democrats and Republicans about the president\u2019s apparent desire to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, Congress hasn\u2019t acted on legislation aimed at shielding Mueller from political interference. And both the House and Senate have failed to advance measures that would dial back Trump\u2019s war-making and surveillance powers.\n\n\u201cMembers who support free trade now risk the ire of Trump and receiving the \u2018Flake treatment.\u2019 Most conservatives will calculate that it\u2019s not worth the risk and now the pushback is dead on arrival.\u201d\n\nRepublicans weren\u2019t likely to change Trump\u2019s mind on the tariffs. For decades, Trump has espoused protectionist views on trade that would align him more with the populist left than the free-market right. And with free-trade proponent Gary Cohn exiting from his role as top economic adviser at the White House just as the new tariff policy was being crafted, GOP lawmakers weren\u2019t optimistic that they\u2019d have an ally in Cohn\u2019s replacement\u2014whomever that may be.\nLawmakers are considering at least two pieces of legislation as a response to the new tariffs. One is the Global Trade Accountability Act, a proposal authored by Lee that would require Congress to approve any trade-related policies imposed by the executive branch.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a path forward where the president would receive it well,\u201d Tillis said.\nAnother measure is being crafted by Flake, a longtime supporter of free trade who has been critical of Trump on a number of fronts\u2014even suggesting that a Republican who shares his views should challenge Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. Flake\u2019s legislation will aim to nullify the steel and aluminum tariffs altogether.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nFor many of Flake\u2019s counterparts, though, now isn\u2019t the right time to upend ongoing conversations with the administration about further narrowing the tariffs policy to include more exemptions for certain countries.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a little quick to turn to either the Flake or the Lee bill,\u201d Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO), a member of Senate Republican leadership, told The Daily Beast. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about the current trade policy, but I\u2019m not of the view that it\u2019s time yet to re-do the executive structure in that policy.\u201d\nEven some of Trump\u2019s staunchest allies on Capitol Hill are opposed to the new tariff policy, and many of them have aired their frustrations to the president directly. And while many of them would be inclined to support legislative action in response, they believe Flake isn\u2019t the right person to carry the free-trade banner\u2014not because of his longstanding views in support of free trade, but because of his opposition to Trump.\n\u201cWhat could have been a cordial disagreement over policy is now a rallying cry for Never Trumpers,\u201d a senior GOP aide told The Daily Beast. \u201cMembers who support free trade now risk the ire of Trump and receiving the \u2018Flake treatment.\u2019 Most conservatives will calculate that it\u2019s not worth the risk and now the pushback is dead on arrival. It\u2019s a shame because this is a genuine instance of where Congress should assert Article I authority.\u201d\nOne Senate Republican aide implored lawmakers to take the rare opportunity to curtail executive power over a policy that nearly everyone on Capitol Hill opposes.\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s unilateral action on tariffs is a tremendous opportunity for both parties to come together and limit executive branch power,\u201d the aide told The Daily Beast. \u201cI hope the Democrats don\u2019t waste it.\u201d\nBut Democrats on Monday didn\u2019t seem eager to join Republicans\u2019 attempts to push back against the administration based on the substance of the policy.\n\u201cI think the process the president followed to make his tariff decision and to announce it has troubled a lot of my colleagues was troubling because it was clear that it wasn\u2019t fully vetted through the different departments and the White House,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) told The Daily Beast.\nAside from their opposition to the policy itself, Republicans are concerned that the tariffs could upend the economic message they\u2019re hoping to use with voters in the upcoming midterm elections, especially on the heels of the tax-cut legislation. In particular, they worry that the tariffs could function as a tax hike on consumers at the same time that they plan on touting a booming economy.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-trade-war-swelling-but-congress-wont-act?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Margaret Carlson", "body": "An interview on Morning Joe last week of former Fox News anchor Eric Bolling inadvertently gave another startling glimpse into Trump\u2019s (in)capacity to run the country and deal with its crises. By design, the segment wasn\u2019t about Bolling\u2019s departure from the network over sexual misconduct allegations but something more tragic\u2014the death of his son from opioids later on the very day he packed up his office and left. What Bolling kept returning to in the segment was how many times Trump had called to comfort him, even having him to the White House for a visit. That\u2019s all to the good. Bolling deserves whatever help he can get in coping with his terrible loss. For the rest of us, it\u2019s one more reminder of how Trump substitutes gestures for action in solving an opioid crisis that addicts more than 2.5 million each year with deaths rising 28 percent in the past year. Nearly 175 Americans die from opioids every day. In fact, Trump hasn\u2019t just neglected the effort, he\u2019s diminished it. Opioids, like school shootings, are the moral failing of our time. We know what would work in that studies show it\u2019s not primarily economic despair driving the increase in addiction, as those who want to relieve drug makers of responsibility would have it. It\u2019s increased supply. With both drugs and guns, a solution takes standing up to powerful corporate interests, which Trump will not do. Despite promises all during the campaign and a declaration that opioids were a national health emergency a year ago, the Office of National Drug Control Policy, popularly known as the drug czar\u2019s office, has hardly been an office; nor has it had a drug czar. In fact, after Trump\u2019s dramatic pronouncement, last year he floated cutting the drug czar\u2019s office by 95 percent with the goal of eventually eliminating it altogether. That didn\u2019t fly. At least Capitol Hill believes the crisis deserves the fig leaf of having the White House behind it. That didn\u2019t stop Trump from quietly gutting it. The office\u2019s most important duties have been handed over to the Justice Department, where drugs are a matter of law enforcement, not regulating the pharmaceutical companies or helping ravaged communities in their efforts to rescue the addicted. This Monday, Trump continued his effort to remove his White House from the drug control effort with his proposal to slice the drug czar\u2019s budget from $385 million to $29 million by 2019. This proposal came two days after Trump finally got around to nominating a drug czar. It\u2019s Jim Carroll, a fine lawyer, but how he ended up being nominated tells you a lot about Trump\u2019s interest in solving a problem. Carroll currently serves as White House deputy chief of staff, a job that now-disgraced secretary Rob Porter was going to be promoted to before his alleged wife-beating was exposed. If you think the moribund drug czar\u2019s office is anything but a place for Carroll to land with dignity, you\u2019ll believe Trump\u2019s lawyer Michael Cohen\u2019s recent assertion that he personally paid a porn film star $130,000 out of the goodness of his heart. \u00a0The drug czar position under Trump began in infamy. The first nominee, former Rep. Tom Marino, was chosen by Trump for his successful effort to gut the law designed to punish pharmaceutical companies that flood drug mills with pills. 60 Minutes exposed the scandal, and Marino had no choice but to withdraw his nomination. Although it defies belief, the gutted law still stands, despite Senators Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joe Manchin from hard-hit West Virginia proposing legislation to restore the government\u2019s power. Until a few weeks ago, the drug czar\u2019s office, into year two without a permanent director, was largely being run by Taylor Weyeneth, a 24-year old campaign volunteer put into the office\u2019s number-two slot by the White House with no relevant experience other than being moved by a relative\u2019s death from a heroin overdose and having organized a golf tournament. According to an investigation by The Washington Post, he picked up the duties of eight departed administration appointees including the general counsel and chief of staff. In actuality, as described by a former staffer, Weyeneth, who inflated his resume to include a master\u2019s degree from Fordham, did little but cook up reasons to visit the West Wing, schedule meetings in attractive destinations, and, for all we know, take long walks on the beach. Coming to grips with drugs and guns aren\u2019t like the moon shot or conquering Mars, speculative and massively costly. With attention, an experienced director, and full budget, it could be done. Instead, as with so much else, Trump is empty promises and phone calls. Whether his neglect is benign or malignant, doesn\u2019t matter.

Now, he\u2019s announced his comeback in an interview with Ben Schreckinger in GQ magazine. He is, Schreckinger writes, \u201cplotting the next stage of his right-wing populist revolution\u201d which he plans to launch this spring or summer. Bannon tells him, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be focused on the promulgation of ideas, the weaponizing of ideas and building and binding together through affiliate groups.\u201d Social media will be an important component in building \u201ca 10 million man digital and analog army.\u201d \nBannon picked a rather strange venue to announce his plans. Likely, the foot soldiers he hopes to enlist have never read GQ or even heard of it. The interview must therefore be viewed as a message from Bannon to the establishments of both political parties. He claims American elites are out of touch with the people and are \u201ccomfortable with America being in decline.\u201d Now he is putting both parties on notice. He plans to recruit from Trump\u2019s right-wing base while maintaining that he supports Trump, a stance that will be important if he is to attract Trump\u2019s followers. He also plans to recruit from Bernie Sanders\u2019 left-wing flank of the Democratic Party with his appeal of economic nationalism. \nTo those who tell him that his populist nationalist movement does not have concrete policies, he points out that neither did the Tea Party in the first few years; but they were against Obamacare, observing that \u201cthere\u2019s plenty of power in just being against.\u201d On foreign policy he says we are confronted with a new \u201caxis of evil,\u201d one quite different from the one George W. Bush laid out in his first term. \nThe threat to the United States, and the entire West, according to Bannon, is coming from China, Iran (which he calls by its old name, Persia), and Turkey. That axis, he argues, is \u201cconfronting the Christian West\u201d and resembles the period in the 1930s before the start of World War II. In that era, FDR had to break the isolationist mood of the country to take on the threat from Germany and its allies which of course he never really succeeded in doing until Pearl Harbor. \nAs for Putin\u2019s Russia, Bannon acknowledges that \u201cthe Russians are bad guys.\u201d Nevertheless, given the threat from the axis, he believes that the United States must \u201creset the relationship with Russia\u2026 and end the Cold War.\u201d He thinks Donald Trump gets this, but most of the other political forces don\u2019t. His stance on the Russian issue seems a throwback to the policy of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and it puts Bannon in line with the views of pro-Russian analysts like Stephen Cohen and others writing for The Nation magazine, as well as Trump followers who buy Bannon\u2019s thesis on the Russian issue. \n\n\u201cIt is rather fanciful for Bannon to assume he will get the support of leftists simply because they have one economic goal in common.\u201d\n\nCohen has appeared many times on Tucker Carlson\u2019s Fox News program, where in terms similar to Bannon, he argues against a \u201cCold War\u201d stance by the United States and urges friendship with the Putin regime. While the editors of America\u2019s premier left-wing opinion magazine stand among those who hate Trump, their obstinate stand on the Russian issue could apparently lead them to giving support to Bannon on this foreign policy position. \nI would not be surprised if he gains the support of Russophiles like the hard-right congressman from California, Dana Rohrabacher. The Putin government is so enamored of the congressman that he evidently received a code name from the Russian spy agencies, whose leaders saw him as an intelligence source. A supporter of Trump, who now may well be critical of some of Trump\u2019s new anti-Russian moves like giving arms to Ukraine, Rohrabacher would be ready and more than willing to join forces with Bannon. \nIt is on domestic policy that Bannon\u2019s approach becomes quite interesting. While his foreign policy is in line with an \u201cAmerica First\u201d position and is clearly nationalist, on domestic policy Bannon lines up with many on the left, whose support he hopes will shift to the new movement that he intends to build. Remember that at the time of the announcement of the tax cut introduced by Trump, Bannon argued for a much higher tax on the rich and bemoaned the fact that the bill was negligent in that regard. \nBannon believes that on economic issues, Sanders and many self-proclaimed socialists are \u201ceconomic nationalists.\u201d They favor tough negotiations to get trade deals that benefit the American worker as well as protectionist tariffs that protect goods made in the United States, and hence the jobs of American workers. Bannon in the interview does not address the problem that the foreign powers we\u2019re dealing with could institute their own retaliatory tariffs, leading to a trade war that will drive prices up in the United States and produce serious negative repercussions, as many are predicting right now in the wake of Trump\u2019s announcement about steel and aluminum. \nBannon has not repudiated his friendly relations with those in Europe he sees as allies for a new movement, especially like Marine Le Pen and the National Front in France, which many have described as a \u201ccrypto-fascist\u201d party. Le Pen, like Bannon, believes that Islam is at war with the West, and like American nationalists, is against open borders, for immigration restriction, and especially banning further immigration from Muslim nations that harbor many jihadists. \nShe is also pro-Putin and for reconciliation with Russia. Putin\u2019s government was openly funding her last run for the French presidency, and she is sympathetic with his authoritarian bent and his repressive stance toward those who favor the creation of a democracy in Russia. \nIn France, Le Pen ran her campaign to the left of the French Communist Party on many domestic matters, calling for more welfare state spending and defending herself as a protector of working people who are losing all because of \u201cwild and anarchic globalization.\u201d She favors the reindustrialization of France, and pulling out of the Eurozone. Reports indicate that many French Communists voted for her and support her party and its programs. In many ways, Bannon\u2019s respect for and his outreach to the left is similar. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s election became an inspiration to the new hard-right European parties. Le Pen was ecstatic about his victory, and her claim that she would \u201ctake back France\u201d is her version of Trump and Bannon\u2019s goal for America. Trump also favors France leaving the EU, which is a common nationalist demand. And of course, the Brexit victory in Great Britain was the fulfillment of the goal of one of their main allies, Nigel Farage.\nBannon said in one of his interviews with the journalist Joshua Green in his book that Trump\u2019s rise was one manifestation of a new powerful global undercurrent. \u201cThat\u2019s why,\u201d he explained, \u201cyou see a nationalist movement\u2026 Look at Le Pen in France, Orban in Hungary, and the nationalists in Poland.\u201d\nThat is why he sees Orban and others as potential allies, even though in Hungary, Orban boasts about creating a new \u201cilliberal democracy.\u201d Orban sounded much like Bannon when he explained in a July 2014 speech that the \u201cnew state that we are constructing in Hungary is an illiberal state, a non-liberal state. It does not reject the fundamental principles of liberalism such as freedom\u2026 but it does not make this ideology the central element of state organization, but instead includes a different, special, national approach.\u201d \nSimilarly, Bannon is much in line with the new authoritarian government of Poland, where the Law and Justice Party supports the type of protectionist policies that were once the domain of the left, and where the government has moved to curtail the opposition press and to tear down an independent judiciary. All these measures echo Donald Trump\u2019s many statements that he sees the same enemies at home and wishes he could accomplish in the U.S. what Poland and Hungary have in Europe.\nBannon, who always presents himself as anti-Wall Street, although he made his fortune working at Goldman Sachs, argues that he and his new movement will represent working people. \u201cThe greatest power on earth,\u201d he tells his interviewer, \u201cis the working men and women of this country. They have a nobility to them. They have a certain power to them.\u201d When Schreckinger observes accurately that his statement \u201creminds me of Woody Guthrie,\u201d the ironies are many. \nIn a recently discovered song, Guthrie wrote a ballad against Trump\u2019s father Fred, titled \u201cOld Man Trump.\u201d His song protests the racial restrictions on properties held by his company in the 1950s, for which he and his son Donald were both sued by the Justice Department in the 1970s. Guthrie, who lived for two years in the Trump property known as Beach Haven, wrote the following:\nBeach Haven is Trump\u2019s Tower\nWhere no black folks come to roam,\nNo, no, Old Man Trump!\nOld Beach Haven ain\u2019t my home!\n\n\n\nAnd of course, Guthrie was a Communist. Yet Bannon says that although people say that \u201cThis Land is Your Land\u201d is a communist song, the \u201cpopulist left have taken it, but it\u2019s still one of the most powerful songs written in this country. So I\u2019m a big fan.\u201d Somehow, I don\u2019t think were he alive, Woody Guthrie would be pleased to hear Steve Bannon\u2019s praises. \nLet us not forget, however, that during the years of World War II, Communists endorsed the strategy of becoming a pressure group on FDR\u2019s administration, hoping to push it to the left. Bannon\u2019s obvious hope is that a movement he forms will have the same effect on whatever conservative administration is in power, especially the current Trump one. It is also rather fanciful for Bannon to assume he will get the support of leftists simply because they have one economic goal in common. The left will never support a movement that sees itself as ethno-nationalist and which the left already perceives as racist. \nNor is it certain that he will get the backing of the white working-class voters in swing states that put Trump in power. If he does succeed in getting some of them to join him, others will stay where they are or even vote for someone like Sanders. Many will already be disillusioned with Trump, and Bannon cannot count on their votes. As J.D. Vance put it about Trump before the election, Trump was selling \u201csnake oil\u201d to them, and the same will be said about Bannon. It could also split the GOP and conservative vote, thereby assuring Democratic Party wins. The future for Bannon\u2019s movement is therefore problematic.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/steve-bannon-thinks-lefties-will-join-his-xenophobic-crusade?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "John Stoehr", "body": "I suppose Bernie Sanders believes he's accomplished something in not endorsing Senator Dianne Feinstein for a fifth and final term. At this point, however, we should be doubtful the Vermont independent can achieve more than political gesture. \nIt\u2019s true that today\u2019s Senate is among the oldest in the nation's history and probably does not reflect the viewpoints of younger Americans as it might if it were less geriatric (a caucus that could include, some might argue, Sanders himself). But is that good reason to unseat an 84-year-old incumbent seeking her final term?\nActivists aimed to accomplish one thing at the California Democratic Party\u2019s convention last month. They\u00a0denied\u00a0Feinstein, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, their party\u2019s endorsement. Oh, and they booed a lot. Otherwise, Feinstein is a four-term senator from California in the era of Donald Trump.\nWill she be primaried? Yes. In California, everyone competes with everyone in primaries regardless of party. Will she win? Almost certainly. Along with the jungle party, Feinstein has another built-in advantage: being a Democrat in a midterm year that\u2019s a referendum on a Republican president. \nStill another advantage is that she\u2019s lead to charge to reinstate the ban on assault weapons, and she\u2019s hammering the president for kowtowing to the gun lobby\u2014especially important in a year when it seems that this issue might actually cut in the Democrats\u2019 favor.\n\n\u201cIf certain Democrats who\u2019ve been inside the system for a while seem corrupt, there\u2019s probably a good reason for that.\u201d\n\nI get that her senior status is an issue, but seriously, the only instrument of direct power a senator has is her vote. As long as she can vote in accordance with her constituency, and mostly in line with her party's priorities, Feinstein\u2019s advanced age is nary an impediment. Hell, Strom Thurmond was a century old when he retired. As long as his aides could\u00a0wheel him onto the Senate floor\u00a0to vote along party lines, his age was pragmatically moot.\nWhy is Feinstein\u2019s age being\u00a0held up\u00a0as an issue? Because activists will take any excuse to whack her. Feinstein has never been popular with the party's grassroots. She favored capital punishment when they were against it. She supported the Iraq War when they were against it. For these and other political sins, Feinstein is seen as a relic of another age when the Democrats were a truly centrist party (think Bill Clinton) rather than the center-left party it is today.\nThat activists are targeting Feinstein is worrisome\u2014for progressive politics. It suggests the base, as it functions in California, will accept gesture in lieu of power, an outcome of the Sanders campaign that does not receive the scrutiny it deserves. \nIt\u2019s one thing to blast a sitting senator as insufficiently loyal to progressive causes. It\u2019s another to accomplish something for having done that. If all you've done is deny an incumbent an endorsement, you haven\u2019t done much. If denying an endorsement results in defeat, what then?

It should establish a channel of communication with Feinstein and find common areas where it can push like hell. Instead, it attacks her, thus marginalizing the left, thus fueling soaring levels of resentment, thus giving people like California State Senate leader Kevin de Le\u00f3n ample fodder for exploitation.\nWhat\u2019s the point of politics? It shouldn\u2019t be ideological purity. It should be \u201cmaximizing human freedom.\u201d That\u2019s how the radical\u2019s radical, Saul Alinsky, put it. The question, then, is what\u2019s needed to do that. In part, it would be keeping a shoo-in like Feinstein in place in the Senate while attacking vulnerable Republicans\u2014all in the interest of acquiring the power needed to effect change.\nDoing that will dirty your hands. That\u2019s inevitable. But that should not be an impediment to doing what\u2019s needed. Guess whose hands are dirty? Dianne Feinstein voted with her party to increase Pentagon spending\u2014a no-no for most leftists\u2014in exchange for billions in relief funding for Puerto Rico and other disaster areas. Democrats got billions for children\u2019s health, too. Feinstein did something \u201cbad\u201d to achieve something good. Activists should understand that.

When we act politically, he wrote in\u00a0Rules for Radicals\u00a0(1971), we must do so bearing in mind what\u2019s best for humanity, not what\u2019s best for our own consciences.

Crack open the champagne, pat yourselves on the back, and welcome Conor Lamb, the apparent winner of the latest special election, to Washington with open arms. \nBut then sober up, for you may not see his likes again. Democrats say there are many Conor Lambs out there. Honk if you\u2019re a Democrat who\u2019s served in the military, holds a respectable job and has an all-American family who\u2019s not been recruited to run. \u00a0\n It\u2019s just that not every candidate with the right resume is a best-in-show candidate as Lamb was, a prosecutor who put drug dealers in jail in a place where opioids are killing family and neighbors, and didn\u2019t talk like an Ivy Leaguer. Most candidates can\u2019t pull off being Mr. Potato Head, loose parts plugged in to make him look palatable to a divergent electorate: a Democrat against abortion, at home firing an AR-15 when 17 children were just slain at school in Parkland, and comfortable throwing shade on his party\u2019s leader Nancy Pelosi in the midst of resurgent women\u2019s movement led by #MeToo. \nThat and a decent economic message that neutralized the tax bill is what it took to do well not just in Allegheny County outside Pittsburgh but in blood-red Westmoreland and Washington counties. This is not to say Democrats shouldn\u2019t go right or won\u2019t be able to without losing their souls. Certainly being in the minority erodes your soul and steps must be taken. But not everyone is as smooth as Lamb, not every election is special, and not every opponent as weak as Rick Saccone, although he wasn\u2019t as lame as his party would have you believe.\nPennsylvania\u2019s 18th congressional district may be conservative but we now see a \u00a0limit in such places for Trump-style chaos. I\u2019m from Harrisburg in the swath of the state called Alabama, where we like our coffee burnt, our funnel cakes coated in sugar, and remember the 50\u2019s fondly. Generally, a candidate as dull as Saccone would go down easily. \nBut Trump, who\u2019s not delivered much to them but chaos, was on the ballot, despite Lamb trying to downplay that in his victory lap Wednesday. Trump is so unhinged right now that a rally meant to help Saccone was so full of self-involved ranting and rambling it likely hurt more than it helped. The president is \u00a0in a particularly unhinged phase. Driving to the polls, voters were treated to coverage of the firing of the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, which could have only been handled more poorly if chief of staff John Kelly hadn\u2019t kept the president from doing it while his top diplomat was on foreign soil trying to patch up the president\u2019s s-hole remarks about Africa. \nHe not only took out his admittedly weak secretary but did so in a coward\u2019s way by twitter, relishing the cruelty, like the bully on the playground who punches you where you are already bruised. Pre-Trump winning CD-18 by 20 points, those voters agreed with Tillerson on the merits: that there\u2019s a lot of work to be done to make Trump\u2019s impulsive decision to meet with Kim Jong-Un have a chance of bearing fruit and that going soft on Russia is a fool\u2019s game that may have emboldened Vladimir Putin to poison two former spies sitting on a bench in London with nerve gas. \nAs Tillerson was taking deep gulps in an emotional farewell press conference, Trump was promising yet more firings. There should be\u2014Trump chose losers he\u2019s tired of with good reason, in particular those who make headlines flying around on what look like vacations and first class ones to boot. \nBut Trump revulsion is not a given among voters like those in PA-18. True, we can be fairly certain he\u2019s going to keep up the behavior the parent of a high school sophomore wouldn\u2019t tolerate. The president can rise five points in the polls by merely reading a State of the Union speech off the teleprompter, hiring a Marine general to run the place, and getting rid of the disheveled, angry Steve Bannon. The bar is so low, we\u2019ve grown accustomed to so much, it doesn\u2019t take much for relief from the turmoil to provide a bump. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMuch of the energy among Democrats lies not with the Lamb model but with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren wing, who play well on the coasts but not far inland. The tent has to grow to win but not so big it collapses under the weight of bolted-together, focus-grouped candidates. \nIn some ways, Lamb is a novelty act, given a one-time pass to talk trash about Nancy Pelosi. The press noted it but didn\u2019t pound away every day. As is often the case, there was unconscious rooting not for the candidate but the story, an upset by an underdog that might signal a blue wave. So Lamb got away with it.\nBut for others, taking a swipe at the most powerful Democratic woman in the country might lose the growing bloc of female voters 30 and up who can pull Democrats across the finish line in close races. Hugging an AR-15 to neutralize the NRA while holding on to those who think it\u2019s ludicrous that any teenager can buy a weapon of mass destruction is a stunt that shouldn\u2019t be tried again.

Using F-15s, F-22s, AC-130 gunships, Apache helicopters, MQ-9 unmanned drones, and artillery, U.S. forces killed an estimated 100 attackers, according to some Russian media reports, and destroyed numerous tanks and artillery pieces. Among the reported fatalities, according to a Pentagon official, were Syrian Arab Army soldiers enlisted in the \u201cISIS Hunters\u201d unit, as well as Russian mercenaries working for Wagner, a private military company under the command-and-control of the Russian Ministry of Defense that has been tasked with re-taking oilfields from ISIS.Initially, Moscow denied any connection. \u201cThe reason for the incident were [sic] reconnaissance and search activities by Syrian militia not coordinate with the command of the Russian operations group,\u201d Interfax cited the Russian defense ministry as saying. But much like the Kremlin\u2019s denial of Russian army soldiers or special operators being deployed in Ukraine, this narrative is rapidly eroding against a tide of social media and even pro-Kremlin press claims naming the names of the slain mercenaries and giving details of their funerals in St. Petersburg. If confirmed, this would be first time that U.S. forces directly engaging and killing Russian combatants in Syria, albeit not the first time that CIA-armed forces have done so, as The Daily Beast has previously reported.Additionally, the scuttlebutt among Russian adventurers has swirled with information of those killed and wounded in battle. The problem is that many of the claims being made offer wildly different casualty figures.Curiously, the story of the Wagner losses has not appeared at all on Fontanka, the independent St. Petersburg website that first broke the story of the private military company\u2019s deployment to Syria in 2013. (After Fontanka journalist Denis Korotokov published a series of articles on Wagner in 2017, he was accused on anonymous websites of \u201cbetraying the motherland,\u201d having ties with ISIS, and helping Ukrainian intelligence. Then he began to get violent threats.) Independent war bloggers such as Necro_mancer66 on Twitter and the Conflict Intelligence Team, which usually report on war deaths in Syria unacknowledged by the Russian defense ministry, have been only cautiously reporting individual deaths they have found on social media. (They\u2019re so far up to six.) This time, the story is being promoted largely by pro-Kremlin Russian nationalists, which should make us slightly wary of what conclusions to draw.For instance, Igor Girkin, known by his nom de guerre of Col. Igor Strelkov, a former Russian intelligence operative who commanded separatist forces in east Ukraine before he was sidelined by rivals, took to the social-media platform Vkontakte to claim that no regular Russian forces were in the area, but that \u201c2 tactical divisions of Wagner\u201d \u201cwere hit by strikes from American aviation. One is practically totally destroyed, and the second is smashed 'to smithereens.\u2019\u201d Strelkov, who is based in Moscow, estimated that as many as \u201c100\u201d Wagner mercenaries were killed. And while he once inadvertently furnished the first real evidence that pro-Russian separatists downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in 2014, after they mistook the commercial airliner for a Ukrainian military cargo plane, he cannot be counted as a credible source.For that reason, we suspect that the Vzglyad article is disinformation meant to embarrass the Russian government for failing to defend its assets in the field, if not cajole it into retaliating against the U.S. Privately owned pro-Kremlin news site Vzglyad, produced by top pro-Kremlin social-media propagandist Konstantin Rykov has published purportedly decoded Russian mercenaries chatting with one another from voice tapes that appeared on the Russian-language Telegram channel \u201cWarGonzo\u201d shortly after the firefight with the SDF and U.S. warplanes. Four distinct voices put the total number of mercenaries dead at well over 200, although even they disagree as to the exact figures and details; with some arguing that entire companies were \u201cdestroyed,\u201d and that American flags were draped over the vanquished Russian trenches, which would certainly incite an incensed reaction back in Russia. For that reason, we suspect that the Vzglyad article is disinformation meant to embarrass the Russian government for failing to defend its assets in the field, if not cajole it into retaliating against the U.S. Today, Bloomberg News appeared to corroborate the Vzglyad allegations, reporting that \u201c[m]ore than 200 mercenaries, mostly Russians\u201d were killed in the episode, citing an unnamed U.S. official and \u201cthree Russians familiar with the matter.\u201dThus far, Moscow has not even acknowledged a single loss, much less responded in kind to the U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition. Instead, a Russian defense official couched the official response in more broadly anti-American terms: that the attack \u201ddemonstrated that the true goal of continuation of the unlawful presence of USA forces on Syrian territory is not a battle with the international terrorist group ISIS, but a capture and hold of economic assets under its control that belong only to the Syrian Arab Republic.\u201d Thank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.When pressed on reported Wagner casualties in the Syrian desert, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov answered: \u201cThese reports require verification.\u201d He also said, \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, there is a fair amount of our compatriots in various countries across the world.\u201dOfficially, private military companies are illegal in Russia. But you wouldn\u2019t know it if you listened to Vladimir Putin. In April 2012, Putin voiced his interest in PMCs\u2014known as Chastnye Voenniye Companiye (ChVK)\u2014and their potential utility as \u201can instrument in the pursuit of national interests without the direct participation of the state,\u201d continuing, \u201cI believe that it should be considered, thought over.\u201d Despite his support, and some efforts in the State Duma to draft legislation in support of the mercenaries, PMCs remain outlawed, leaving them in a precarious position and dependent upon their utility to the Russian state. PMCs have the same attraction to Putin that all proxies, mercenaries, or contractors have to all states: deniability and low-cost. They are expendable, easily written off as patriotic \u201cvolunteers\u201d and not state actors, whose demise needn\u2019t be counted as wartime losses, and whose possibly lethal behavior lowers the risk of escalation with the enemy. Dead mercenaries avoid the unwanted press and attention that comes with young army conscripts returning home in zinc-lined coffins. The very first deployment of Russian PMCs in Syria was more Keystone Kops than Spetsnaz. First appearing in 2013, the Slavonic Corps was formed as an offshoot of the Hong Kong-based Moran Security Group. From the get-go, their intervention was marked by confusion, poor coordination, and aged equipment. First tasked with seizing back regime oil fields, the Slavonic Corps\u2019 mission quickly turned into a rout as they were outmatched in both numbers and equipment by anti-Assad opposition forces. The embarrassment did not end there. On their return to Russia, the ex-members of the Slavonic Corps were arrested by the FSB, Russia\u2019s domestic intelligence service, and most were charged with violating Article 348 of the Russian Criminal Code, banning mercenary service. And yet, while Russia\u2019s first use of PMCs was less than an unalloyed victory, the Kremlin\u2019s appetite for soldiers of fortune has only increased in the years since. The next opportunity came with the conflict in Ukraine, and Russia\u2019s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and incitement of rebellion in the Donbas. The use of proxies and PMCs came to form a central component of Russia\u2019s \u201chybrid war\u201d strategy. In order to support Russia\u2019s activities in Ukraine, a veteran of the Slavonic Corps and former Spetsnaz officer was chosen. Lt. Col. Dmitry Utkin, who until 2013 was an officer in the 2nd Spetsnaz Brigade of Russian military intelligence (GRU), called this new group \u201cWagner\u201d in honor of Hitler\u2019s favorite composer. Apparently, in addition to being a veteran of both the Slavonic Corps and Spetsnaz, Utkin has an affinity for the \u201caesthetics and ideology of the Third Reich,\u201d making him not just a neo-Nazi but that oh-so-perfect embodiment of Putinist disinformation efforts: a combatant ostensibly deployed into a neighboring country to stop a \u201cfascist junta,\u201d as the Kremlin routinely called the government in Kiev, from exterminating ethnic Russians.However, this outing turned out to be far more favorable than the maiden foray into Syria. Among the mixture of rogues, Mafiosi, and killers that made up Russia\u2019s rebel army in Eastern Ukraine, Utkin and Wagner provided Russia with a competent and loyal unit able to do its bidding (including, reportedly, eliminating those more feral rebel commanders who had outlived their usefulness). A crucial feature of Russia\u2019s support of the Assad regime has been to stabilize it. Spetsnaz advisers provide crucial reconnaissance to Russia\u2019s air contingent and support Syrian government offensives. Russian officers help organize, train, and deploy the various militias that make up most of the regime\u2019s fighting force, along with advising the regime\u2019s larger military and strategic planning. For the most part, Russia has been successful in avoiding getting its \u201cofficial\u201d forces sucked into direct ground combat. Getting directly involved in on-the-ground fighting would damage the Kremlin\u2019s narrative that they are there as \u201cpeacekeepers\u201d and, recently, that the combat portion of their mission has ended. But Syrian forces are unable on their own to obtain key objectives that are crucial to sustain the Assad regime, and the narrative that they are fighting\u2014and winning\u2014the war against ISIS. To get around these issues, Russia has turned to Wagner. Crucial in the offensive to retake Palmyra, Wagner and its Russian mercenaries have become an even more important element of Russia\u2019s efforts in Syria. They allow Russia to deploy capable and professional forces who have the experience and training to seize strategic objectives without the potential blowback of casualties. Mercenaries receive no state funeral and are not officially reported, allowing Russia to maintain the fa\u00e7ade of winding down its involvement.As Assad\u2019s position has solidified, Russia\u2019s focus has centered around regaining assets that will enable the regime to economically support itself\u2014and pay for the continued supplies and weaponry. According to documents seen by the AP and Fontaka, Evro Polis has signed a contract with Syria\u2019s state-owned General Petroleum Corp. for 25 percent of the proceeds from all the oil and natural-gas fields it captures from ISIS. Peskov\u2019s \u201ccompatriots\u201d around the world should all be so lucky.While at first the agreement seems similar to other resource rights for mercenary deals of the past, the ownership and structure of Evro Polis gives even greater insight into the workings and connections between economics, favors, and power in Russia. Evro Polis is reportedly Wagner\u2019s commercial front in Syria. It is owned by Putin\u2019s \u201cfavorite chef\u201d Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose companies have extensive contracts to provide food for everyone from the Russian defense ministry to most of Moscow\u2019s public schools. Most famously, Prigozhin set up a \u201cKremlin troll factory\u201d in St. Petersburg to influence public opinion in the West by peddling conspiracy theories and disinformation on social-media platforms.Not simply an agreement to incentivize Wagner\u2019s continued involvement in Syria, the Evro-General Petroleum deal is also an incentive for keeping mercenaries on board for future Russian adventures abroad. And given the tensions between Moscow and Damascus owing to latter\u2019s reliance on Russian loans and oil shipments to keep the lights on and the Syrian war machine humming, the Kremlin has every reason to coax its team of expendables into helping Assad regain control of more of his captured hydrocarbon industry, be it from ISIS or an emerging U.S. protectorate in eastern Syria, which has shown every intention of not handing major oil fields back to the regime.For this reason, last week\u2019s events seem more a prelude than an anomaly in what has been a war of proliferating sideshow conflicts. So long as Putin has Wagner to provoke or skirmish against the Syrian Democratic Forces, he can attack U.S. allies without formally attacking them and risk retaliation from the Pentagon, while insisting that the Russian military was nowhere near the scene of the crime.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/did-the-us-really-kill-200-russians-in-syriaor-just-a-few?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Spencer Ackerman", "body": "Republicans on the House intelligence committee investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election have refused Democratic entreaties to subpoena Twitter for direct messages of Donald Trump associates, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell The Daily Beast. \nSources would not share with The Daily Beast specifically whose DMs committee Democrats wanted to subpoena Twitter to acquire. But in hearing transcripts, Democrats have indicated they want DMs concerning Donald Trump Jr. and Trump consigliere Roger Stone\u2014both of whom have been linked to Wikileaks, which famously released hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 campaign. \u00a0\u00a0\nIt\u2019s the latest sign that the Republicans on the hyper-factionalized committee are willing to focus on anything but potential collusion between Donald Trump and the Kremlin in the 2016 election. Trump\u2019s associates tend to share their boss\u2019s love for Twitter and, like many users of the social network, have been known to use direct messaging for sensitive communications.\nAnd it comes as frustrated Democrats are accusing their Republican colleagues behind closed doors of intransigence that leaves them in a precarious position for any investigation: being asked to trust witnesses without the tools to verify their stories. \n\u201cFor months, we have repeatedly requested that the Committee subpoena Twitter for communications between numerous persons of interest in our investigation,\u201d Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the committee, confirmed to The Daily Beast. \n\u201cA complete investigation would subpoena relevant communications records\u2014including Twitter messages\u2014to corroborate or contradict witness testimony,\u201d added Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat on the committee and a former prosecutor.\n\u201cThe GOP has been unwilling to do that. If we don\u2019t do that, we are conducting a take-them-at-their-word investigation. There are too many Trump team members who are not worthy of being taken at their word.\u201d \nDemocrats who want to subpoena Twitter for the private messages of Trumpworld figures are operating on the theory that the communications would either reveal substantive discussion of election machinations tied to Russia or vindicate the denials of actual and potential Trump-camp witnesses. But the Republicans have sat on the requests instead of fulfilling them or denying them outright.  \nRepresentatives for committee chairman Devin Nunes and Russia investigation chief Mike Conaway did not reply to a request for comment. \n\n\u201cWe are conducting a take-them-at-their-word investigation. There are too many Trump team members who are not worthy of being taken at their word.\u201d\n\u2014 Rep. Eric Swalwell\n\nDemocrats are getting restless. They\u2019ve urged in committee hearings dominated by Nunes\u2019 accusations of surveillance malfeasance that the Republicans are blocking access to witness documentation, including travel records and communications logs. The DMs fall in that category. \nTwitter, for its part, has pledged to cooperate with both the House and Senate Russia inquiries and Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s unfolding inquiry. But the company has said a lot less about how it cooperates. Turning over a user\u2019s DMs without being lawfully compelled to do so would spark serious questions about how the company treats user privacy with implications far beyond the Russia probe. \n\u201cTwitter continues to work with the Special Counsel\u2019s Office and with Congress throughout their investigations, providing relevant information and cooperating through appropriate law enforcement channels,\u201d the company said in a Friday statement. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

In the published DMs, WikiLeaks nudges the younger Trump toward its 2016 publication of Democratic emails that U.S. intelligence assesses Russia hacked, and even suggests that Trump refuse to concede the election if he lost. Congress acquired those messages not from Twitter, but from the younger Trump\u2019s attorneys \u2013 raising questions about how complete the Trump Jr.-WikiLeaks colloquy actually is. \nOn February 5, the committee met to consider the release of the Democratic rebuttal to Nunes\u2019 accusations against the FBI and Justice Department. But the transcript revealed a deep Democratic frustration over the committee\u2019s inability to access all sorts of relevant documentation. \nFor example: Peter King, a Long Island Republican, referenced not \u201csee[ing] anything at all\u201d to contradict the Trump attorney Michael Cohen\u2019s insistence that Cohen never met in Prague in August 2016 with a Russian official. \nSchiff, the senior Democrat on the panel, replied in the meeting: \u201cWhat we have not had the opportunity to do is determine whether he was telling us the truth, because we have made requests to get documents, the subpoenaed documents, and the majority has been unwilling to support those requests to subpoena documents. When that is the case, then we have no way of verifying or disproving information.\u201d \nAmong the information Schiff said the GOPers had declined steps to acquire are subpoena requests for unspecified Trump Jr. documents and unspecified Deutsche Bank records. (Trump is approximately $360 million in debt to Deutsche Bank, which faces accusations of acting as a vehicle for Russian money laundering, and there are disputed reports that Mueller has served subpoenas on the bank.) \n\u201cNumerous times, we have asked for documents, we have requested to subpoena documents from Twitter when we know there were direct communication between Don Jr. and Twitter, and Roger Stone and Twitter. These requests have gone nowhere with [the] majority,\u201d the February 5 meeting transcript records Schiff saying. \n\n\u201cWe have requested to subpoena documents from Twitter when we know there were direct communication between Don Jr. and Twitter, and Roger Stone and Twitter. These requests have gone nowhere.\u201d\n\u2014 Rep. Adam Schiff\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Don Jr. who was prone to DMing about the election. Stone, in August and September 2016, DM\u2019d with the Russian cutout Guccifer2.0, an intermediary that claimed to provide the DNC material to WikiLeaks. Stone has also claimed to have a backchannel to WikiLeaks, which would explain his prescient fall 2016 predictions about material damaging to Democrats the group would publish. But it\u2019s not clear if that backchannel, said to be radio host Randy Credico, is genuine, and WikiLeaks has denied it. \nNunes, the committee chairman, has wide-ranging authority for subpoenas under the committee bylaws. (PDF) He hasn\u2019t seen fit to subpoena Twitter for the DMs, but has subpoenaed Fusion GPS, the political research consultancy that sponsored ex-British spy Christopher Steele\u2019s dossier. That followed on an August subpoena (PDF) to the FBI and Justice Department for documentation surrounding their \u201crelationship\u201d to Steele and the dossier. More recently, Nunes has announced unilateral plans to investigate Trump investigators and members of the Obama administration, either at the current Justice Department or the State Department under John Kerry.\n\u201cThe committee\u2019s rules provide that only the chairman can authorize a subpoena, and a serious investigation requires that the committee not simply take witnesses\u2019 word at face value, but verify their testimony when possible through communication records obtained from third parties,\u201d Schiff told The Daily Beast. \n\u201cAnd while that power has been used freely against government officials and Fusion GPS, for the purposes of the Russia investigation this vital investigative power has been foreclosed.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Andrew Desiderio", "body": "The Trump administration on Thursday approved a massive new weapons sale to Ukraine, as that country continues to defend itself against Russian-backed separatists.\nThe decision represents a show of force against Russian President Vladimir Putin, as the United States and its allies continue to accuse Moscow of destabilizing eastern Europe and the Middle East through the use of military incursions and cyber warfare.\nThe $47 million sale includes 210 Javelin anti-tank missiles and 37 launch units, the State Department said, and it comes less than three months after the administration approved a similar lethal defensive weapons sale.\n\u201cThis proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by improving the security of Ukraine,\u201d the department said. \u201cThe Javelin system will help Ukraine build its long-term defense capacity to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity in order to meet its national defense requirements.\u201d\nCongress has 30 days to nix the sale, but lawmakers from both parties have been supportive of such measures in the past and are unlikely to block it. Republicans, in particular, have praised the administration for approving weapons sales to Ukraine in the past, and have pointed to those actions to rebut criticisms that the Trump administration hasn\u2019t been tough enough on Russia\u2014particularly when it comes to mandatory sanctions against Moscow, many of which have not yet been implemented as required by law.\nDemocrats have derided President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson over the non-implementation of new sanctions against Russia that Congress passed overwhelmingly last year. But when it comes to providing military assistance to Ukraine and sanctioning alleged Russian human-rights abusers, they\u2019ve praised Trump and other top officials.\nThursday\u2019s announcement runs counter to a controversial change that was made to the Republican party platform in 2016. The Daily Beast reported at the time that top Trump campaign officials tried to soften language in the party\u2019s official platform about military aid to Ukraine in order to make it more Russia-friendly. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who has been indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller, used to work for Ukraine\u2019s pro-Kremlin president, Viktor Yanukovych. In December, a GOP delegate said Trump himself was directly involved in the platform change.\nRep. Mac Thornberry (R-TX), the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told The Daily Beast on Wednesday that the administration should be doing more to ensure that Moscow pays a price\u2014including the full implementation of those congressionally mandated sanctions. Still, Thornberry said Thursday, Trump\u2019s team is doing more to counter Russian aggression than the Obama administration.\n\u201cBy renewing strategies to confront Russia in the National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy, agreeing to help arm Ukraine and restoring America\u2019s military strength, the Trump administration is taking important steps to turn that trend around, but much more needs to be done,\u201d Thornberry said in a statement.\nThe timing of Thursday\u2019s weapons announcement likely wasn\u2019t lost on top administration officials.

The Daily Beast was not invited, but was briefed on its contents by three sources with knowledge of the meeting.\nAccording to those sources, Kelly recounted a very awkward conversation with Tillerson during which he informed the secretary that President Donald Trump would very likely soon fire him. The awkwardness was less a result of the contents of the conversation than its setting.\nTillerson, Kelly told the room, was suffering from a stomach bug during a diplomatic swing through Africa, and was using a toilet when Kelly broke the news to him.\nSources were stunned that, even in an off-record setting, Kelly would say this\u2014to a room filled with White House officials and political reporters\u2014about Tillerson, who does not officially leave the State Department until the end of the month.\nKelly is routinely touted as one of the more mature members of Trump\u2019s top brass and has often been branded as one of the \u201cadults\u201d in charge.\nThe comment was especially bizarre given Kelly\u2019s reported past cover for Tillerson.

At the time, the United Nations was gearing up for its largest-ever meeting of heads of state to mark the organization\u2019s 60th anniversary. The fete was to take place the annual United Nations General Assembly that September, the focal point of which was a major package of reforms that had been painstakingly negotiated by countries prior to the September summit.\nBut weeks before presidents and prime ministers were to arrive to celebrate the successful signing of these reforms, John Bolton entered the picture. Bolton was granted a recess appointment by George W. Bush on August 5, just as negotiations entered their final stages.\nThe talks were \u00a0immediately thrown into disarray.\nBolton inserted hundreds of objections to a late draft of the agreement, creating new \u201cred lines\u201d for the United States where none had previously existed. His objections covered issues big and small -- even on semantics. For example, he rejected the mere mention of a poverty-alleviation program called the \u201cMillennium Development Goals.\u201d He refused to budge from his maximalist position on this and every other edit he made to the document.\nAt the time, he seemed to relish in the chaos that he had sewn. During late night press encounters he would quip \u201cAll night, all right!\u201d, as if his goal was less to negotiate in good faith and more to just drag out the negotiations as a deadline loomed.\nEventually, as I reported at the time, then-Secretary General Kofi Annan got so fed up with Bolton\u2019s antics that he called then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and asked her to reign him in. She did. The reform packages passed at the eleventh hour. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIn his memoir, he reserves his harshest criticism and deepest vitriol not for the representatives from Iran or Venezuela, but for his British counterpart, UK Ambassador Emyr Jones Parry, whom he mercilessly pillories as an \u201cEU Roid.\u201d\u201d\n\nThat incident presaged Bolton\u2019s entire tenure at the UN. The memoir he wrote of his experience at the UN was titled \u201cSurrender is Not an Option.\u201d But Bolton\u2019s time at the UN suggests that, to him, the natural give and take of diplomacy is akin to \u201csurrender\u201d and must be avoided at all costs. Understanding how he performed his job at the UN gives us big clues as to how he might approach the job as National Security Advisor to which he has just been named. \nAt the United Nations, Bolton demonstrated a profoundly zero-sum view of international relations. Other countries\u2019 gains -- no matter how insignificant -- \u00a0were ipso-facto America\u2019s losses. This upended traditional alliances at the UN. Typically the United States and its European allies would band together in negotiations that reflected common interests. But Bolton was never willing to give an inch and accept the kinds of trade-offs proposed by American allies. In his memoir, he reserves his harshest criticism and deepest vitriol not for the representatives from Iran or Venezuela, but for his British counterpart, UK Ambassador Emyr Jones Parry, whom he mercilessly pillories as an \u201cEU Roid.\u201d\nThe same dynamic also existed in his interagency battles. He steadfastly opposed a joint European-American initiative to negotiate with Iran, only to be overruled, again, by Condi \u00a0Rice. Bolton also pushed back against efforts by the Bureau of East Asia and Pacific Affairs at State Department (known as the \u201cEAP\u201d bureau) to re-open negotiations with North Korea through a format called the Six Party Talks. In his memoir, Bolton derides American diplomats at the bureau as \u201cEAPeasers.\u201d\nEven before he became Ambassador to the UN, Bolton demonstrated a propensity to fixate on relatively minor foreign policy issues and elevate them to major crisis points. In 2003, Bolton served as the Under Secretary of Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security. As he recounts in his memoir, he relished the opportunity to knee-cap the nascent International Criminal Court, which was set up to prosecute individuals for genocide and mass atrocity. \u00a0\nPresident Bill Clinton, in his final days in office, signed the treaty that created this court. In Bolton\u2019s early days as Undersecretary of State he declared that the United States had \u201cunsigned\u201d the treaty. He remarked that this was his happiest moment of his life as a public servant. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nBut that was not enough. Bolton then embarked on an international campaign to secure bilateral agreements with as many countries as possible to theoretically grant Americans immunity from prosecution by the ICC. He would threaten these countries with a cut-off of military assistance should they not sign onto the agreement.\nOne can argue about the propriety of the International Criminal Court. But his fixation on these immunity agreements created awkward and unnecessary friction with American allies. In 2003, for example, Latvia saw its military aid cut even as it was one of the very few countries in Europe to contribute its troops to George W. Bush's war in Iraq. Latvia was a member of the coalition of the willing, but it was not willing to sign one of these agreements with the United States and so saw some military aid suspended even as its troops were in Iraq.\nWhat does Bolton\u2019s past suggest about how he will approach the job of National Security Advisor?\nGenerally speaking, there are two kinds of National Security Advisors. There are those who emphasize their role as an honest broker between competing viewpoints and bureaucracies to judiciously oversee what is known as the \u201cinteragency process.\u201d And there are those who are infighters themselves, who advocate for specific viewpoints and policies.\nI think we can safely guess what role John Bolton will fill. And that is the real danger. Bolton has famously called for pre-emptive war with both North Korea and Iran. He\u2019s demonstrated a callous propensity to alienate allies. He enters into negotiations unwilling to give an inch.\nSo this is the man who, as of April 9, will be whispering in Donald Trump\u2019s ear and running National Security Council meetings. You\u2019ve read about his extreme positions vis a vis North Korea and Iran. And now you\u2019ve read that he enjoys alienating allies and thinks diplomacy is appeasement.

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, a man who has compromised himself and his supposed values to accommodate and indulge President Trumphausen\u2019s various whims, impulses, urges, feuds, and paranoid episodes finally drew the line and busted Kushner\u2019s security clearance down from TS/SCI to Wal Mart Greeter Background Check (Provisional).\nHear that? That was America's intelligence community down to the last GS-7 breathing a loud sigh of relief.\nKushner is a man who needs a billion dollars fast, and is willing to cast shame on the winds to get there. The stench of his venality and desperation hangs around him like stripper perfume, cloying and obvious. Jared all but hiked up his sassy pink petticoats while whistling, \u201cHey, sailor!\u201d to the Chinese, Israeli, Arab, and Russian investors he begged to invest in his failing 666 5th Avenue white elephant.\nKushner has no one to blame but himself. His ambition exceeded his abilities by orders of magnitude so vast it would take a team of advanced mathematicians a generation to devise a system by which to measure the differential. Even his simpering beta-male, child-voiced affect couldn\u2019t hide his spectacular reach and overpowering thirst for the power, influence, and financial rewards of Washington.\nIt wasn't just that Kushner omitted tens of millions of dollars of investments from his SF-86 and was forced to revise again and again and again, or that his listing of foreign contacts and engagements was glaringly insufficient. It's that he lied and omitted information in a way that was painfully obvious to the FBI and government officials examining his qualifications for the most elevated intelligence clearances. Then, the whispers in foreign capitals started; Kushner, they whispered, is for sale. American intelligence was listening.\nTuesday night, the Washington Post broke a massive story on intercepted intelligence from the UAE, China, Israel, and Mexico in which foreign officials capered in glee over how to manipulate and bribe the Naif Prince of Trumplandia. It\u2019s one thing to be a target. It\u2019s another thing to be an easy target.\nThe knowledge that every foreign intelligence agency in the world saw Kushner\u2019s desperation for cash no doubt set America\u2019s beleaguered counterintelligence community into a state of raw panic. The fact that Kushner is up to his hot-yogaed ass in dealings with Sergei Kislyak and was a key member of the infamous Trump Tower meeting in which Russia offered a quid for a still mysterious quo is just the icing on that cake.\nUntil today, Jared Kushner was one of a handful of recipients of the President\u2019s Daily Brief, a product that compiles the crown jewels of the American intelligence community\u2019s input and analysis. He was exposed to source and methods, high-grade analytical product, and the darkest secrets we have gleaned from the most sensitive sources. Although President Postliterate Bestwords has his PDB presented in graphic novel form or performed by costumed dancers, Jared was apparently an aggressive consumer of intelligence, ordering up briefings and information outside even his broad purview. What he knows after a year in this position makes him the juiciest intelligence target in the world.\nTrump\u2019s nepotism always put the soft-handed Kushner on an impossible pedestal. By the time it was clear even to a slowcoach like Trump that Jared couldn\u2019t be the Minister of All Portfolios, it was too late. The imagined power couple of Jared and Ivanka waged their snippy, passive-aggressive media war from their offices in the West Wing, leaking diligently to boot first Reince Priebus, and then Steve Bannon from the White House. The humiliation of being ousted by Jarvanka must rankle Bannon to this day. Kelly was their next target, but he moved first, and struck hard.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Trump can either give in to the simpering \u201cBut Daaaaaaaady\u201d whinge of Princess Ivanka and restore Jared to his full suite of security clearances, or face a tornado of razor cuts from leaks over Jared\u2019s business dealings and behavior. \nThe almost certain knowledge that Robert Mueller isn\u2019t done with Jared by a long stretch doesn\u2019t make it any easier for Trump, even as the red flags thrown up by Rod Rosenstein over the president\u2019s son-in-law and very special adviser were one more sign of the urgency of closing up the leakiest, riskiest White House in history. The best part of this trap is that Trump (R-Oppositional Defiant Disorder) will be tempted to do the one thing that will make his political situation more politically tenuous and legally risky by restoring Jared\u2019s clearances. It\u2019s within his rights as the President, but he would be dumber than a sack of hammers to do so. A smart President would have already told Jared to pack up and get the hell out, but...oh, who are we kidding?\nThis battle was only ever going to end one way, and in the war of the Deep State vs. Team Trump, the bad guys often make it easy by being greedy, sloppy, and stupid.

They needed only to show they had not come forward simply seeking personal gain as the coach alleged.\nSchechter cites in her decision Trump\u2019s repeated accusations that Zervos and the other women had come forward either seeking fame or at the instigation of the Hillary Clinton campaign.\nAs the decision notes, Trump tweeted that the allegations were \u201ctotally made up nonsense to steal the election.\u201d\nThe decision further quotes Trump at an October, 2016 rally in Pennsylvania:\n\"Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign, total fabrication.

Its chairman Devin Nunes and the committee itself are both hopelessly compromised. Nunes has done everything in his power to cover for the President, his staff, and their Russian contacts, and to elide Vladimir Putin\u2019s stated intent and obvious actions.\nWhen secret agent man Devin Nunes raced to the White House to break a phony story of illegal and inappropriate surveillance from a mysterious \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d it turned out the super-secret intel he set his ass on fire to reveal came from\u2026\u00a0wait for it\u2026\u00a0the White House itself. \u00a0Ezra Cohen-Watnick and Michael Ellis, both employees of the White House, provided Nunes with top secret material outside the approved channels to push one of many of the White House\u2019s endless variations on the \u201cno collusion\u2014no puppet, you\u2019re the puppet\u201d defense. \nNunes released a memo last month that tried and failed to bring the grown-ups\u2019 investigations to a halt, and to change the facts of why Carter Page and Trump campaign officials came under the baleful glare of the FISA Court.

Republican turnout was up just 16 percent.\nDemocrats have specifically targeted three House races in the Houston, San Antonio and Dallas areas, where Hillary Clinton won in the 2016 presidential election. In all of them, it appeared that the top two candidates were likely to head to a runoff following Tuesday\u2019s vote.\nBut the first definitive result of the night was for the state\u2019s marquee matchup of the year. \nRep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX) easily won his primary contest with over 60 percent of the vote, defeating two opponents. Incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) similarly romped in his contest, with nearly 85 percent of the vote. \nWhile Cruz is still the odds-on favorite, political observers believe O\u2019Rourke could potentially give him a run for his money in November. The Democrat has raised $2.3 million in the first 45 days of this year alone, triple Cruz\u2019s haul during that time. \nBefore the results even rolled in on Tuesday night, Cruz issued a stern warning to the Republican party about the unbridled enthusiasm on the Democratic side. \n\u201cIf conservatives are complacent, we know that the left is going to show up,\u201d Cruz said on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s radio show. \u201cThe extreme left, they\u2019re angry.

Those texts \u00a0were then retweeted by our president, in a brushback pitch for Warner's insistence on investigating Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election\u2014and potential collusion with the Trump campaign\u2014without fear or favor. \nThis bombshell story, first reported by the New York Times, is not your garden variety Trump-related drama.

His committee has turned the pursuit of truth into a partisan mockery, choosing to do the White House's bidding at the expense of honest inquiry and fact-based debate. \nThis is a stunning violation of whatever is left of congressional norms, but it also establishes the collusive relationship between hyper-partisans on the Hill and hyper-partisan media, particularly the opinion side of Fox News (there are some good reporters at Fox, including Shepard Smith, Bret Baier and Chris Wallace, who don\u2019t deserve to get dragged into this swamp). This sharing of private information was apparently designed not just to influence domestic debate and inflame internal divisions but also to supply talking points to the President, who \u00a0dutifully retweeted the information as if it was impartial evidence. \nIn fact, as Republican senators, including Marco Rubio, immediately pointed out, the spoon-fed Fox \u201cscoop\u201d was simply dishonest deflection and distraction. \u00a0But that has become the calling card of the Trump administration and its apologists. \nThis cold congressional civil war is another departure from normal, let alone our best traditions.

In some ways, it\u2019s a shame because Nunes had a decent reputation before assuming chairmanship of the House Intelligence Committee. \u00a0But this position seems to have made him more of a hack instead of elevating his game. \nThe once and future dairy farmer should know when he\u2019s shoveling manure.

He was the beneficiary of the highly questionable Russian contacts his campaign made and desperately tried to keep secret leading up to the 2016 election, which speaks of collusion and much worse. Trump couldn\u2019t have chosen two top advisers with more contacts with the Kremlin than campaign manager Manafort and national security adviser Michael Flynn. He could hardly have praised Russia President Valdimir Putin more. And he could have hardly benefitted more from Russian interference than to win. \nOf course, there\u2019s no law against Trump liking Putin; unseemly yes, illegal, no. But a veteran Washington former federal prosecutor who served during both the Clinton and Bush administrations believes there is a strategy that Mueller is quietly pursuing and that explains his actions so far. \nSeth Waxman, now a partner specializing in white-collar crime in Dickinson Wright\u2019s Washington office, has a theory of Mueller\u2019s case, which requires no novel reading of existing law to find Trump broke it. It employs the main weapon any federal prosecutor uses to police public corruption. It is Title 18 United States Code, section 201 that specifically makes it a crime for a public official to take \u201canything of value,\u201d a bribe, in exchange for government action, which can be prospective. \nNote that above I wrote \u201cpublic official.\u201d That\u2019s because the law is generally wielded against public officials. Problem: Mueller is investigating conduct before Trump became one. Enter Waxman. He points out that in 1962, Congress extended the bribery law to cover activity prior to the assumption of office. It did so, he says, in order to close a \u201cloophole\u201d afforded those \u201cwho assume public office under a corrupt commitment.\u201d The upshot? Trump became covered by 18 USC not when he was sworn in but as of July 21, 2016 when he became his party\u2019s nominee in Cleveland, Ohio. \nWhat we know of Mueller\u2019s strategy so far is consistent with leveling charges under the bribery statute. This is not to say Mueller is going to indict Trump. He would need an exception from a Justice Department rule, which advises against it. But neither is he likely to send a report laying out grounds for impeachment as former independent counsel Ken Starr did against Bill Clinton relying solely on perjury and obstruction of justice without a finding of an underlying crime. \n\n\u201cThe upshot? Trump became covered by 18 USC not when he was sworn in but as of July 21, 2016 when he became his party\u2019s nominee in Cleveland, Ohio.\u201d\n\nThe bribery statute requires a finding of a quid pro quo, a this for a that. The quid is obviously Russian meddling in our election\u2014a given to everyone but Trump himself\u2014which worked to his everlasting benefit. Thus Mueller\u2019s focus on the summer 2016 meeting at Trump Tower, the one Trump\u2019s senior team of Donald Jr., Jared Kushner, and Manafort had with Natalia Veselnitskaya, a prominent Kremlin lawyer. \u00a0This was the meeting former chief White House strategist Steve Bannon called \u201ctreasonous.\u201d When it became public, Trump was so concerned he got uncharacteristically involved in the details of defending it, drafting a statement, which said the meeting was simply about \u201cadoptions.\u201d \nIt wasn\u2019t at all. It was an offer of \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton which Don Jr. eagerly accepted, responding, \u201cI love it.\u201d The mere contact, Bannon said, should have prompted an immediate call to the FBI. But Trump was too soft on Putin to see the Russian contacts for what they were and thought he could hide behind the adoption excuse. In any event, Trump welcomed Russian involvement (\u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing\u201d) not to mention Trump\u2019s hope that WikiLeaks would turn its attention to Democrats. He wasn\u2019t joking.\nTrump never got Hillary Clinton\u2019s personal emails but he got a systematic and sophisticated effort to undermine his opponent on social media, the reach of which we only dimly understand, and, according to U.S. intelligence, a successful hacking by Russian military intelligence (the GRU) of the servers of the Democratic National Committee and the email of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, which were handed over to Wikileaks to be published. Podesta\u2019s email set off the rumor a few days before the election that Podesta and Clinton were part of a satanic cult enslaving children in the basement of a Washington pizza parlor. \u00a0\u00a0\nProving the quo specifically is hard but for a bribery to succeed, the act of returning the favor does not have to be completed, especially in the case of a candidate who can\u2019t deliver until later. Trump repeatedly signaled his willingness to warm up the country\u2019s cold war with Putin. When it was pointed out that he was praising an enemy of the United States who kills his political opponents, Trump retorted that we kill people in this country too. \u00a0Trump had his own web of connections to Moscow, from the Miss Universe pageant to business enterprises that Manafort and Flynn were only too happy to enlarge. Kushner hoped to open a backchannel to Moscow once he was in charge of world peace. Manafort already had strong ties to various oligarchs and a line into Putin (a version of which Kushner wanted to establish once in the White House) and slipped in a Russia-friendly clause on Ukraine into the GOP platform. \nIt could be a coincidence, but Veselnitskaya, the Kremlin lawyer who was at the Trump Tower meeting, had long been fighting a money laundering case in New York and suddenly won a favorable settlement after Trump\u2019s election. Most significantly the lawyer wanted relief from the Magnitsky Act, which imposes harsh monetary sanctions on senior Russian officials, a wish being fulfilled by inaction on Trump\u2019s part. During the transition, Flynn was overheard on an intercept advising a Russia official to just hold tight and not overreact to Obama\u2019s sanctions because help in the form of a Trump presidency was on the way. And it has been. Congress overwhelmingly voted to impose new sanctions on Russia. But Trump has yet to bring any. \nEven as more and more in his party concluded Russia meddled, Trump preferred to call the investigation a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and cite Putin\u2019s \u201cfeelings\u201d that there had been no such interference well into his presidency. While Trump has no problem insulting allies like Britain\u2019s Teresa May and Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, he kept Putin close, abandoning his seat at a formal G-20 dinner to go sit beside him, like a teenager at lunch in middle school. Just last week, Trump\u2019s own FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that Trump had yet to ask for an investigation of Russia\u2019s meddling although he was concerned enough to have started one on his own. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nIt took a 13-person indictment against the Russians to pry the slight admission out of Trump that the intelligence community correctly concluded there was an \u201canti-U.S. campaign.\u201d His response was not to reconsider sanctions. Not at all. To Trump, the indictments didn\u2019t implicate him; they incriminated Barack Obama. To prove his point, \u00a0he ordered Attorney General Jeff Sessions to launch an investigation into why, if interference was such a problem, Obama didn\u2019t do more. This ignores that Obama sanctioned four Russian individuals, five agencies including the GRU, expelled 35 diplomats, and closed two vacation compounds. Compared to Trump doing, well, nothing.\nTrump didn\u2019t just do nothing, he welcomed Russia\u2019s help. Trump keeps it simple, declaring he loves those who love him. Russia spread the dirt without his fingerprints on it and he returned the love in the form of a stance toward Russia so positive that his most ardent allies can\u2019t countenance it. \nWaxman notes that July 21 wasn\u2019t only the date Trump became his party\u2019s nominee to be president of the United States. It was also the date he may someday come to rue when he became subject to its bribery law. \nLast week Trump jumped on the statement by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that there was \u201cno allegation in the indictment [of the Russians] that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity\u201d as exoneration of him. But the operative phrase there is \u201cin the indictment.\u201d With Trump aides flipping like pancakes at a state party fundraising breakfast, there are almost certainly indictments to come.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/this-is-the-law-that-could-take-down-trump?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Margaret Carlson", "body": "In many ways, Jared Kushner won\u2019t be any worse off than prior presidential family members working in the White House.

Kushner was given authority to stick his fingers in every pie so that the wattage of any number of other experienced officials was seriously dimmed. Rex who? H.R. Mc Master did what?

At the top of the list in recent years would be Donald Nixon (brother Dick tapped his phone after Don got a large loan from defense contractor Howard Hughes to save his failing burger business); Billy Carter (drank way too much of his eponymous beer and lobbied for Libya); Neil Bush (lucrative business deals, admitted encounters with escorts, and a sordid divorce); Roger Clinton (rock non-stardom after getting out of prison for dealing cocaine); both of Hillary Clinton\u2019s brothers (importing hazelnuts from a former Soviet country and pocketing $200,000 for helping drug dealer friends with presidential pardons). \nIt was only a matter of time before chief of staff John Kelly moved in to stop Jarvanka, with Kushner up first. From the moment he arrived, his main task was really to build a wall around the Oval Office. He blocked those with a hall pass from floating in and out, including, to their consternation, Kushner and Ivanka, a turn of events that must make them regret pushing out former chief of staff Reince Prebius. In the hole after keeping Rob Porter on after domestic violence delayed his security clearance and with no margin for error when it comes to women\u2019s issues, Trump gave Kelly total discretion. He happily grabbed it as a chance at redemption for his lying about the Porter fiasco, and because he finds Kushner and Ivanka dilettantes. \nThe White House insists that multiyear lapses in clearances happen all the time when, of course, they do not. The only thing Trump can do for Kushner now is to grant him a presidential waiver. It would be wrong, usually not an impediment to presidential action in this White House. But more significantly it could lead to Kelly\u2019s resignation when there is no one willing to take such a perilous job. \nIt\u2019s more likely to send Kushner and Ivanka the way of Hope Hicks, sooner rather than later. Their capitol life is a comedown from the heady days when they moved to a white house on the hill in a leafy neighborhood close to their jobs in the other White House. They not only expected to enjoy the fruits of power and influence but to be rescued from the brink of bankruptcy on a flagship building on Fifth Avenue. It wasn\u2019t working out that way even before the smackdown of Kushner. The strain on Ivanka showed earlier this week when she scolded NBC\u2019s Peter Alexander for asking an \u201cinappropriate\u201d question about her father\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct in a whispery voice dripping with \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d hauteur. \nThere have been few glittery evenings to be had, no dinners in the residence with movie stars or historians, the first White House in decades not to hold a State Dinner in the first year.

Hannity has gone to the wall to push for the public release of the memo, which the Intelligence Committee and its chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), authorized this week in a party-line vote despite the classified information therein.Sources say Hannity\u2019s persistent advocacy reinforced Trump\u2019s already growing determination to get that memo into the public realm\u2014despite huge potential fallout within the law enforcement and intelligence arms of his own administration.In their conversations, Trump and Hannity discussed the Nunes memo\u2019s supposed bombshell-level significance, and how it could shed light on the alleged anti-Trump bias and \u201ccorruption\u201d at the FBI. On these calls, Trump has directly referenced specific recent Hannity segments related to #ReleaseTheMemo, according to one of three sources with knowledge of their conversations.The White House press office did not respond to requests for comment, and Hannity declined to comment. Sources, two in the White House and the other an outside adviser, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.Trump not only deeply values the private, after-hours political and policy advice and gossip from his favorite cable news hosts, but is a notoriously avid consumer of their broadcasts, particularly highly sympathetic shows like Hannity and Fox  Friends. As he has inched closer to publicly releasing the Nunes memo\u2014he has privately said it\u2019s all but a foregone conclusion\u2014cable news and right-wing media have shaped his views on the issue, as they have on many other topics, far more so than the briefings or private intelligence provided by those within his administration, White House officials say.On Monday afternoon, the day before President Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, the White House summoned some of the president\u2019s most trusted allies and outside advisers to the Entrance Hall in the official residence.

In some cases, he cited specific TV interviews and segments from the past weeks that he found particularly compelling and fun to watch.

Those spying tools do not belong in the hands of ICE agents.\u201dIf ICE joins the Intelligence Community, then its officials will have increased access to raw intelligence, unfiltered by analysts. This could prove useful to both of the agency\u2019s components: Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which investigates transnational crimes, including drug trafficking, money laundering, cybercrimes, and arms trafficking; and Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), which arrests and detains undocumented immigrants. \u201cICE has for the past decade been keenly interested in joining the Intelligence Community,\u201d Peter Vincent, general counsel for ICE under the Obama administration, told The Daily Beast. \u201cICE officials have felt that by doing so, they would have greater prestige and credibility and authority.\u201dThe question is: at what price?ICE\u2019s two components sometimes work together on operations. Both components\u2013\u2013HSI and ERO\u2013\u2013could face challenges if the agency joins the Intelligence Community. Unlike most intelligence agencies, which focus on gathering information about America\u2019s adversaries, ICE\u2019s agents and officers deal with federal courts every day. If they use classified material to generate leads, that information could be inadmissible in court. Both the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, which are in the Intelligence Community, deal with this issue. Adjusting would be a challenge for ICE. Vincent said this could create \u201cmany potential mission creep spectres, especially in this current climate,\u201d and that he doesn\u2019t think it would be necessary for ICE to join the Intelligence Community. Thank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\u201cThere would have to be massive changes,\u201d said the current official. Charlie Allen, formerly chief of intelligence at the Department of Homeland Security, told The Daily Beast he thinks this move would be unwise.\u201cI think it works fairly well,\u201d he said of ICE\u2019s intelligence work. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should complicate the architecture further.\u201d He said it\u2019s \u201cvery vital and important\u201d to take the head of ICE\u2019s intelligence work into certain critical IC meetings, but added a larger change could complicate the way DHS handles intelligence issues. \u201cI do believe that it would be a step backward to make ICE a separate element within the U.S. Intelligence Community,\u201d he said.A spokesperson for ICE declined to comment on this story, and a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security didn\u2019t respond to a request. \u00a0\u201cSuch a move threatens to give an agency responsible for domestic immigration enforcement access to a vast pool of sensitive information collected by our spy agencies for foreign intelligence purposes.\u201d\u2014 Patrick Toomey with the ACLUBut Vincent told The Daily Beast that this stop-and-start effort is more likely to gain White House support under President Donald Trump than it was under Obama. While Trump frequently lambasts the FBI, he has yet to say anything critical of ICE, the agency which arrests and detains undocumented immigrants. A former senior ICE official told The Daily Beast that one possible outcome would be that part of ICE\u2019s internal Office of Intelligence could join the IC. The former official added that some ICE officials currently have access to unfinished intelligence and counterintelligence products called Intelligence Information Reports. Joining the IC would give the agency greater access, a seat at the table to potentially influence the IC\u2019s priorities, and a greater ability to share intelligence it gathers with the broader IC. ICE officials would need additional training on how to minimize data involving U.S. persons the agency shares throughout the Intelligence Community, the former official added. Right now, ICE data on U.S. persons\u2013\u2013meaning, all citizens, as well as non-citizens in the U.S.\u2013\u2013isn\u2019t automatically minimized, the official said. So officials would need training on how to protect U.S. persons\u2019 identities before sharing their information throughout the broader IC\u2013\u2013training which would be doable, but would take effort. Trump could put ICE in the IC by executive order, though that would be unusual. A lengthy process is more likely. First, ICE officials would have to get approval of their efforts from Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Then the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and members of Congress would consider the request.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/ice-wants-to-be-an-intelligence-agency-under-trump?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "The Trace", "body": "By Brian Freskos. This piece originally appeared on\u00a0TheTrace. Nikolas Cruz was too young to buy a pistol at a gun shop. But no law prevented the teenager from purchasing the assault-style rifle he allegedly used to kill at least 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida, on Wednesday.Authorities said Nikolas Cruz, 19,\u00a0passed a background check\u00a0and bought the rifle from a licensed dealer in February 2017.\u201cNo laws were violated in the procurement of this weapon,\u201d Peter J. Forcelli, the special agent in charge for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Miami,\u00a0told The\u00a0New York Times.Florida isn\u2019t unique. In most states, people can legally buy assault-style weapons before they can drink a beer. Federal law stipulates that gun stores and other licensed dealers may not sell a handgun to anyone under the age of 21, but they can sell long guns\u2014i.e., rifles and shotguns\u2014to anyone who is at least 18, according to\u00a0Giffords Law Center to Prevent Violence.Only two states\u2014Hawaii and Illinois\u2014have raised the minimum age to purchase a long gun to 21.And when it comes to owning a gun, age limits are even looser. There is no federal minimum age requirement for long guns. As\u00a0The Washington Post pointed out, if a father wants to buy his young son a rifle for his birthday, it is perfectly legal for him to do so in much of the country.Twenty-three states have set minimum age requirements for the ownership of long guns, ranging from 14 in Minnesota to 21 in Illinois and Hawaii. In the District of Columbia, a person has to be 21 to own a long gun unless they have parental consent, in which case they only have to be 18. In Florida, where the mass shooting took place, the minimum age requirement for owning a long gun is 18.Handguns are subject to much stricter requirements. A 1995 Bureau of Justice Statistic\u00a0report\u00a0found that handguns were involved in more than 85 percent of gun related crime. Handguns were involved in 57 percent of all homicides (including non-gun related killings), while rifles were connected to just 3 percent.But assault-style rifles have been involved in many of the high-profile mass shootings over the last six years. In 2012, Adam Lanza used an rifle made by\u00a0Bushmaster\u00a0to kill twenty children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Omar Mateen was armed with a\u00a0Sig Sauer rifle\u00a0when he massacred 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Florida two years ago. Stephen Paddock reportedly had multiple assault-style rifles when he sprayed bullets into a crowd of Las Vegas concertgoers in October, killing 58 and injuring hundreds.Last year, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals declared assault-style rifles\u00a0weapons of war. The ruling meant that Americans did not have an unfettered right to buy such rifles under the Second Amendment and that states were free to regulate them. Seven states and the District of Columbia\u00a0have banned\u00a0such rifles. Florida is not one of them.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/heres-why-american-teenagers-can-buy-ar-15s?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Sam Stein", "body": "The Trump White House spent the latter part of this week teasing the likelihood that someone was going to be fired. It could be a National Security Adviser. Or the HUD secretary. Perhaps the chief of staff. Or all of them. \nBy Friday morning, senior Trump administration officials were wondering if their own jobs were even safe. And then\u2026.. nothing happened. The day came and went and no one was let go. Unless they were after this piece was posted. Honestly, it could happen. No one knows, including those sitting inside 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.\nThis is the current state of Trumpland: a presidency conducted like a reality show with no one quite certain of the script. Those close to the president say he revels in the drama that he\u2019s allowing to unfold. But veterans of past White Houses find it both counterproductive and, if they\u2019re being blunt, certifiably insane. \n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what is happening in Trumpworld. Up is down and down is up. Everyone is getting fired and no one is. The cast of Fox and Friends is going to run the National Security Council,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, a former top aide to President Barack Obama. \u201cWe obviously operated differently.\u201d\nFor embattled agency officials in particular, the unfolding drama has fed a sense that, when controversy flares, the West Wing is unhelpful at best and adversarial at worst. \u201cIf there\u2019s a crisis, they\u2019re not there to help us,\u201d as one senior administration official put it. \u201cEach agency operates on its own.\u201d\nInside the administration, some officials have grown convinced that the president and his staff can no longer be relied on to defend top officials from controversy and, indeed, will actively work to worsen a cabinet secretary\u2019s troubles if it means insulating the president from any blame. \nOne official pointed to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson\u2019s staff, which was mostly left to fend for itself this week in the wake of revelations that the secretary spent tens of thousands of dollars on adornments to his office. As a number of cabinet secretaries face scrutiny of their travel habits, that official added, agencies have grown loathe to provide the White House with any information due to concerns that the information will be leaked\u2014or used against those bosses down the line, if they end up on Trump\u2019s bad side.\nEven officials who are not on the president's shortlist for sacking seemingly grasp the risks of providing material on demand. \nTwo knowledgeable West Wing sources have told The Daily Beast that the White House had weeks ago requested that EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt\u2019s staff turn over documents pertaining to Pruitt\u2019s travel expenses. (The administrator is currently facing increased scrutiny after reports surfaced that Pruitt was flying first class on the taxpayer dime.) These sources say that Pruitt\u2019s team has frustrated the White House by \u201cdragging their feet,\u201d according to one source, and not handing over comprehensive documentation of these expenses.\nAs of Friday morning, the EPA still had not produced the requested materials to the White House. One source described it as further evidence of a \u201cbreach of trust\u201d that has become \u201ctoo common\u201d between senior officials at the EPA and the Trump White House.\nEven as it stonewalls the White House, the EPA appears to be working cooperatively with Congress on a nearly identical request. As The Daily Beast reported this week, the EPA missed a deadline for handing over travel records to the House Oversight Committee, but both the committee and the agency said they were working to get those records turned over.\nThe creeping paranoia and feelings of distrust between cabinet agencies and the West Wing are not without merit. Behind the scenes, White House officials and Trump in particular have mused with outside advisers about potential replacements for officials facing controversy\u2014musings that then made their way into press reports of a seemingly imminent high-level purge. On Friday, Axios reported that in an off-the-record meeting with reporters, Chief of Staff John Kelly acknowledged that the president was likely the source of many of those reports. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

McMaster, whose job seems to be perpetually close to an inglorious end. Senior officials told reporters on Thursday that Trump had finally decided put his National Security Adviser out to pasture, only for other officials to clarify that McMaster wasn\u2019t going anywhere\u2014at least not at this immediate second. \n\u201cMcMaster death watch has been going for a long time now; it\u2019s now a matter of who replaces [him] and when,\u201d is how one senior White House official described it to The Daily Beast on Thursday evening. \u201cIt could be National Security Adviser [John] Bolton, it could be Geraldo. Place your bets.\u201d\nOn Thursday night, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted, \u201cJust spoke to [Trump] and Gen. H.R. McMaster - contrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC.\u201d A White House official later told The Daily Beast that the tweet was calculated and \u201ccarefully worded,\u201d noting \u201cnothing in there [is] a lie.\u201d\nSpeculation has also swirled around Kelly\u2019s future, only to (as in McMaster\u2019s case) be hastily downplayed as Beltway gossip. By mid-day Friday the White House was assuring reporters that Trump and his chief of staff had smoothed out their differences, which stemmed from the firing of White House staff secretary and alleged wife beater Rob Porter last month.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin has been on thin ice over the misuse of taxpayer funds. But his standing has been hurt even further as White House officials have agitated for a replacement.\nProminent Trump allies publicly state that all is well, the change can be good\u2014including for the ousted\u2014and that a little bit of uncertain can prompt harder work and energy. \n\u201cThis is normal turnover that you get in any administration from time to time,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s former press secretary Marc Lotter, who left the administration on his own accord last year, told The Daily Beast. \u201cObviously, they are 14 months in. These jobs are mentally and physically demanding. So, I think you do see that natural transition in bringing in some new faces and new ideas, and folks to deal with these high-stress and mentally taxing positions.\u201d\nBut not everyone is convinced that the president is playing a game of three-dimensional chess as he lets his top aides and cabinet members wonder if they\u2019ll have a job in the coming day. \n\u201cTo say what he is doing is mind games would be like calling a monkey throwing his feces art,\u201d said Pfeiffer. \u201cI don't think he knows what he is doing.\u201d", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-is-mindfking-his-own-cabinet-and-senior-staff?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Betsy Woodruff", "body": "Cambridge Analytica hoped to capitalize on Russian hacking of Hillary Clinton and her ally, an email written by one of its employees indicates. \nEmily Cornell, the employee, sent the email on July 29, 2016.

According to Mueller\u2019s indictment, which heavily relied on findings by The Daily Beast, the baker\u2019s dozen were linked to a Kremlin-backed troll farm, the Internet Research Agency, and \u201chad as its object impairing, obstructing and defeating the lawful governmental functions of the United States by dishonest means in order to enable the Defendants to interfere with U.S. political and electoral processes, including the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\u201d\u201cI know this is a slow-moving story, the [Russia probe] indictments\u2026but this was big today,\u201d offered Maher at the top of his monologue. \u201c[Mueller] indicted 13 Russian nationals [and] three Russian companies for their plot to use social media to rat-fuck our 2016 election.

If they want to see the devil\u2014let them see one.\u201d Mueller charged that the troll farm engaged in identity theft and established fraudulent social-media accounts to spread propaganda to targetable audiences both pro- and anti-Trump. As The Daily Beast has extensively detailed, the Russians pounced on issues from immigration to racialized policing to gun violence. The objective was \u201csupporting radical groups, users dissatisfied with [the] social and economic situation and oppositional social movements,\u201d echoing the intelligence assessment\u2019s central view that Russia began its election interference to heighten domestic U.S. political discord.Deniability of their Russian origin came through stealing and falsifying American passports, driver\u2019s licenses, Social Security numbers, and birthdates, which they used to establish American identities tied to online ads and social-media accounts. One such false identity was the alias \u201cMatt Skiber,\u201d Mueller charged, who offered to an unwitting Trump supporter aid facilitating a \u201cMarch For Trump\u201d rally.

The false \u201cMatt Skiber\u201d was involved in that one as well, asking the secretly-Russian-run Being Patriotic Facebook group: \u201cWhat about organizing a YUGE pro-Trump flash mob in every Florida town?\u201dAround August 18, the \u201cFlorida For Trump\u201d Facebook account administrator gave \u201cSkiber\u201d instructions to \u201ccontact a member of the Trump Campaign (Campaign Official 1) involved in the campaign\u2019s Florida operations. A different fake account, [email\u00a0protected], emailed the official to offer the support of Being Patriotic: \u201cYou know, simple yelling on the Internet is not enough. There should be real action. We organized rallies in New York before. Now we\u2019re focusing on purple states such as Florida.\u201dBut not all of them were presumed Trump supporters. In a case first reported by The Daily Beast, Russian imposters cybersquatting the Facebook page of the United Muslims of America posted a plea to \u201crefuse to vote for Hillary Clinton because she wants to continue the war on Muslims in the middle east and voted yes for invading Iraq.\u201d Offline, they \u201crecruited a real U.S. person\u201d to hold a Clinton sign with a fake quote: \u201cI think Sharia Law will be a powerful new direction of freedom.\u201d In total, Mueller charges, the troll farm had an internal list of \u201cover 100 real U.S. persons\u201d they contacted\u2014complete with \u201ca summary of their political views,\u201d their Russian-directed activities and their contact information\u2014to monitor what Mueller called \u201ctheir recruitment efforts and requests.\u201dAnd in an example of the Russians fueling both sides of U.S. political division, they greeted Trump\u2019s election with dueling pro- and anti-Trump rallies in New York, as well as a \u201cCharlotte Against Trump\u201d rally a week later in North Carolina.

Trump ping-ponged between various policy positions and postures, invariably making unforced interjections that would make his staunchest pro-gun supporters cringe.\nWhen Vice President Mike Pence talked about how those who are a \u201cdanger to themselves or others\u201d should have their firearms taken away, but also afforded due process, the president jumped in to one-up Pence.\n\u201cOr, Mike, take the firearms first, and then go to court,\u201d Trump said, breaking with his own vice president on live TV. \u201cBecause that's another system. Because a lot of times, by the time you go to court, it takes so long to go to court, to get the due process procedures.\u201d \nThe president continued, sounding like the gun-grabbing Democrats he\u2019d once warned against: \u201cI like taking the guns early. Like in this crazy man\u2019s case that just took place in Florida\u2026 To go to court would have taken a long time. So you could do exactly what you're saying, but take the guns first, go through due process second.\u201d\nWhite House spokespeople did not immediately respond to questions on whether or not this was now the official position of the Trump White House. However, two administration officials told The Daily Beast that aides were already preparing \u201cclarifications\u201d for future statements or briefings in anticipation of being asked if the president wants to take away people\u2019s guns without due process. \nThe comment did, however, rankle some feathers among Republican lawmakers. \u201cBefore you take away someone\u2019s gun, they\u2019re entitled to due process,\u201d Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA), a Trump ally, told The Daily Beast.\nTrump\u2019s gun-grabbing moment, of course, would be another addition to the ongoing trend of senior Trump aides claiming after the fact that the president did not say what he, in fact, said publicly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s to the effect of: the president was not talking about violating anyone\u2019s rights, he was talking about keeping guns out of the hands of violent, mentally unstable people and criminals,\u201d one official said, explaining what a canned response would look like.\nIn the course of an hour, Trump cast aside other key pillars of Republican orthodoxy on gun rights. \nHe endorsed legislation first pushed by the Obama White House to expand federal background checks for private gun sales, shot down GOP efforts to expand the rights of concealed carry permit-holders, and even suggested reviving a Democratic measure to ban \u201cassault weapons.\u201d\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), who has pushed an assault-weapons ban for years, was visibly giddy as the president suggested including that measure in congressional gun-control legislation. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get it passed,\u201d the president then declared.\nFor Trump, it was a reversion to positions he held nearly two decades ago. In his 2000 book, The America We Deserve, Trump wrote, \"I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.\u201d \nAfter returning to the Capitol, Democrats who attended the meeting were elated but cautious that the president could renege on his promises like he did on immigration, when he promised to sign whatever legislation Congress sends him.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t mince words about it. I don\u2019t understand how, then, he could back away from that,\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much clearer he could have been.\u201d\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) said the onus is on Trump to deliver GOP votes on a comprehensive background-checks bill.\n\u201cHe asked why nothing has happened. The reason why nothing has happened is because Republicans have given the NRA veto power on background-checks legislation,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIf the president is the deal maker, the closer that he claims to be, then he will deliver Republican votes on a background checks bill.\u201d\n\u2014Andrew Desiderio contributed reporting.", "link": null, "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Scott Bixby", "body": "Sam Nunberg, stop your mouth from moving.\nThat\u2019s the legal consensus among some of the country\u2019s top criminal defense attorneys when asked how they would counsel the onetime Trump campaign adviser, whose Triangle Shirtwaist-scale flameout on Monday led confidants\u2014and one anchor\u2014to worry if he was drunk-dialing cable news hosts.\n\u201cI would tell him that he\u2019s had his fun, now put on your big-boy pants, shut up and hire a lawyer,\u201d said Charles Clayman, founding partner and chair of Clayman  Rosenberg LLP.

In 2005, she helped destroy 92 videotapes showing their torture. She faced no consequences for those actions, and, assuming senators ask about them at her upcoming confirmation hearing, it\u2019s likely that her answers will be given in a closed, secret session.\nBut Haspel\u2019s actions may well have violated international law, specifically the UN Convention against Torture. Could she face prosecution?\nLegally speaking, yes. But politically, almost certainly not.\nThere are two legal avenues for a case against Haspel. The first is the International Criminal Court (ICC), and the second is a domestic court of a European nation. \nThe ICC is a better fit conceptually. Its entire purpose is to prosecute people for \u201cgenocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and aggression.\u201d And despite legal counsel provided to the Bush administration at the time, the kinds of torture which Haspel supervised when she oversaw a CIA \u201cblack site\u201d in Thailand are almost certainly violations of the UN Convention against Torture. \nMary Ellen O\u2019Connell, professor of international law at Notre Dame Law School, told The Daily Beast that Haspel \u201cclearly broke the law\u2026 Every member of the CIA is aware that the U.S. is a party to the Convention against Torture. Even members of the military would have had the duty to disobey a manifestly unlawful order from superiors to use torture.\u201d\nNot only did Haspel not disobey orders, some experts believe that she gave them herself, while supervising the interrogation of Zubaydah and Nashiri, and subsequently destroyed the tapes. The answers may be in the 6,000-page Senate intelligence committee report on torture during the Bush administration that remains classified (only the 524-page executive summary is authorized for release).\n\n\u201cEvery member of the CIA is aware that the U.S. is a party to the Convention against Torture. Even members of the military would have had the duty to disobey a manifestly unlawful order from superiors to use torture.\u201d\n\u2014 Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell, professor of International Law at Notre Dame\n\nMoreover, O\u2019Connell noted, the ICC itself is \u201cunder pressure, with developing world countries leaving, for the court to look even handed.\u201d Nearly all ICC prosecutions have thus far been of Africans; a high-profile investigation of a sitting CIA director would help dispel concerns that the ICC is biased in favor of \u201cfirst world\u201d defendants.\nThe problem with the ICC is jurisdiction. Under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which established the ICC in 1998, the court can only hear of abuses that were either committed by an ICC member nation or took place within an ICC member nation. The United States is not a member: It signed the Rome Statute, but the Senate didn\u2019t ratify it. \nThailand, where Haspel\u2019s black site was located\u2014at the international airport outside Bangkok\u2014is in the same situation. It\u2019s a signatory, but not a member. \nThe only way that Haspel could be prosecuted at the ICC, then, is if she had responsibility for war crimes that took place in another country that, unlike Thailand, is an ICC member nation. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nThe most likely candidate is Poland, where the CIA operated another black site, but it is not known whether Haspel had responsibility for that site, or exactly what took place there. \nIn other words, the ICC may not have jurisdiction at all, and absent additional leaks, it\u2019s hard to see them gaining any information about what did or didn\u2019t happen in Poland.\nEven Haspel\u2019s testimony to the Senate may be of little use. It is common practice for intelligence officers to request a closed hearing for matters related to national security, and until the Russia Investigation, it was unheard of for members of Congress to divulge the records of such hearings. \nAt Haspel\u2019s public hearing, you can expect her to refuse to answer any question that has to do with torture, black sites, extraordinary rendition, on the grounds it could compromise national security\u2014to say nothing of her own prosecution.\nSo much, then, for the ICC. What about the second option: domestic courts in other countries?\nAndrew Novak, professor of international law at George Mason University, told The Daily Beast that \u201cmany countries have universal jurisdiction laws when the law of nations has been violated, as in cases of torture, slavery, or genocide. They would have jurisdiction if someone\u2019s not being prosecuted elsewhere.\u201d\nMoreover, \u201cafter Rwanda and Yugoslavia, there are very broad laws to prosecute war crimes,\u201d Novak said.\nThis has happened before. According to O\u2019Connell, cases against Americans implicated in torture have proceeded in Spain, Italy, and Belgium. For example, O\u2019Connell said, \u201cItaly issued arrest warrants for CIA agents involved in the kidnapping and rendition of a Muslim cleric. One of the agents\u2026 was arrested on the warrant and held for a time in Panama. Another woman was arrested in Portugal a few months ago.\u201d\nA similar process is already underway in Haspel\u2019s case. In Germany, the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), has filed a series of complaints with the country\u2019s federal prosecutor, urging him to investigate.\nAndreas Sch\u00fcller, director of ECCHR\u2019s International Crimes and Accountability Program, told The Daily Beast that this campaign has been going on for years. \u201cIn 2014, when the Senate report on the CIA came out, we filed a brief criminal complaint\u2026 They opened a preliminary examination\u2014not yet an investigation, but a file that establishes the initial suspicion to open a case.\u201d\nIn 2015 and 2016, ECCHR filed two more extended complaints, one regarding the Army\u2019s alleged torture of inmates at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, and a second on the CIA\u2019s alleged torture at black sites.\n\u201cIn 2016, Gina Haspel\u2019s name was not known,\u201d Sch\u00fcller said, \u201cbut when she was nominated as vice-director of the CIA last year, we had a name to connect to other facts we had presented already.\u201d \nNow, the ECCHR says, \u201cGina Haspel must face arrest on traveling to Europe.\u201d\nBut would the German federal prosecutor really go after the the CIA director, when such a move would gravely damage U.S.-German relations? \nSch\u00fcller agreed it was unlikely.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect to see that move,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we want to achieve is to say: look, there was torture, there is the UN Convention Against Torture, and you [the government] know who this person is. If you allow her to come here, you are making a clear political decision that you prioritize that over your obligations under the Convention Against Torture\u2026 They can\u2019t say they didn\u2019t know who was coming here.\u201d\nMoreover, Sch\u00fcller added, \u201cthe legal accountability debate continues and makes life at least a little bit harder for the people making those decisions [to conduct torture]. It\u2019s something they have to take into account.\u201d\nIn sum, while the actions documented in the Senate\u2019s report would be strong grounds for a war crimes prosecution of Gina Haspel, it\u2019s very unlikely that anyone will make use of them.

On at least 19 different occasions, candidate Trump insisted the unemployment numbers were cooked. \u00a0At a media event in September 2015, for instance, Trump bashed the rate, which stood at 5.3 percent, as \u201csuch a phony number,\u201d and \u201cthe biggest joke there is in this country.\u201d The actual rate, he claimed, fell somewhere between 18 and 32 percent, maybe even 42 percent. As late as December 2016, Trump was calling the jobs numbers \u201ctotally fiction.\u201d \u00a0But all this was while Barack Obama was president. Once Trump was inaugurated, the numbers became real.\nAfter the first jobs report of 2017 was released, which revealed the unemployment rate was continuing its downward trend set under Obama, reporters asked Sean Spicer if Trump still believed the report was phony. \u00a0\u201cI talked to the president prior to this,\u201d Spicer said, \u201cand he said to quote him very clearly: 'They may have been phony in the past, but it\u2019s very real now.'\u201d Huh?\nTrump\u2019s derision of the unemployment rate\u2014like his derision of the press, intelligence community, justice department, and federal judiciary\u2014was typical cynical political maneuvering; in this case, an attempt to puncture Obama\u2019s record on jobs, which was in fact excellent. During Obama\u2019s presidency, the U.S. saw 75 straight months of job growth, the longest streak in American history. Unemployment under Obama plunged from nearly 10 percent in late 2009 to 4.8 percent when he left office. The stock market, too, did extremely well under Obama, as the Dow Jones nearly tripled from 6,800 when he took office to almost 20,000 when he left. (While GDP didn\u2019t grow particularly well under Obama, it remained sluggish in virtually every developed country in the world, indicating significant global factors at play.)\nIn addition to Obama\u2019s record-setting jobs streak and tripling of the Dow, consumer confidence and wages were trending upward when he left office. And despite Trump\u2019s relentless boasting about his own \u201ceconomic revival,\u201d the 1.7 million new jobs added in 2017 were surpassed by Obama in five out of seven years (excluding 2009, which was before Obama\u2019s policies went into effect). All this following the most devastating economic crisis since the Great Depression.\n\n\u201cThere are signs that a severe economic downturn will occur under Trump\u2014just as one has occurred under every Republican president since Reagan.\u201d\n\nBut talk to your typical Trump supporter and they will insist Obama was a disaster for the economy. Ask them about Trump\u2019s first year in office, however, and they will point to the economy as proof he\u2019s done a terrific job. \u00a0Never mind Trump\u2019s stripping away of environmental protections (toxic waste, methane leaks, and drinking water pollutants are no longer regulated as strictly); his profiting from public office (Mar-A-Lago\u2019s membership fees doubled to $200,000 last year); normalization of lies (the Washington Post counts more than 2,000 Trump falsehoods since he\u2019s taken office); demonization of the press; shrinking of our national parks; intimidation of federal judges; coarsening of our culture; cheating on his wife and allegedly paying hush money to a porn star; failure to fix health care; abandonment of Puerto Rico; or even that the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists advanced its Doomsday Clock to \u201ctwo minutes to midnight\u201d largely because of Trump\u2019s belligerence toward North Korea. The economy, say his supporters, is what we should focus on.\nThe economy is, indeed, robust. But let\u2019s not forget that the economy was robust under the last Republican president, George W. Bush, until it wasn\u2019t. Trump\u2019s tax cuts, as the Guardian recently pointed out, are set to kick in \u201cat the worst possible moment,\u201d with rising interest rates looming and a \u201cdanger of the economy overheating.\u201d Indeed, there are signs that a severe economic downturn will occur under Trump\u2014just as one has occurred under every Republican president since Reagan. \u00a0Conservative economic philosophy over the past 40 years has been remarkably myopic: reflexively cut taxes and slash regulations to give the economy a quick boost, future budgets be damned. As then-vice-president Dick Cheney infamously asserted when justifying budget shortfalls under George W. Bush: \u201cReagan proved deficits don\u2019t matter.\u201d In fact, Reagan\u2019s reduction of the top income tax rate from 70 percent to 28 percent and his tripling of the national debt have been widely blamed for the Bush I recession.\nAlong with Trump\u2019s ill-advised tax cuts\u2014that are expected to add more than $1 trillion to the national debt\u2014the president has slashed regulations at a feverish pace. Reagan, Bill Clinton (the \u201cnew Democrat\u201d who borrowed many of his financial policies from conservatives), and George W. Bush all notably cut regulations on the financial industry. We saw how that worked out. Slashing regulations, like cutting taxes, typically excites industry and provides a short-term boost to the economy. But less oversight almost invariably leads to risky, reckless behavior. It\u2019s no coincidence that the big financial scandals of recent decades have occurred under Republican administrations. The junk bond scandal of the \u201980s, the Enron collapse of 2001, and the 2008 global financial meltdown were all fueled by deregulation, fraud, and lack of transparency.\nOne major piece of regulation that Trump (with bipartisan support in the Senate) has begun chipping away at is Dodd-Frank, the Wall Street reform bill Obama signed in the wake of the 2008 crisis. By increasing oversight of financial firms, Dodd-Frank helped stabilize our financial system, allowing the stock market to begin its steady climb that has lasted through the present (two of three major market indexes grew more during Obama\u2019s first year than Trump\u2019s). Commercial banks were more profitable than ever in 2016, yet Trump Tweeted that Obama\u2019s regulations \u201chave been devastating.\u201d So he appointed Mick Mulvaney as the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2014\u201ca guy who doesn\u2019t even believe the CFPB. should exist,\u201d one critic charged\u2014and his Treasury Department is trying to make it easier for banks to avoid the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d label that would subject them to more oversight. Wall Street penalties have already plummeted under Trump. But even Trump\u2019s own Office of Management and Budget vindicated Obama\u2019s regulatory approach. In its annual report, released last month, the non-partisan OMB found that the benefits of Obama-era regulations far exceeded the costs.\nIn a 2004 interview with Wolf Blitzer, citizen Donald Trump observed that \u201cthe economy does better under the Democrats than the Republicans,\u201d adding, \u201cwe\u2019ve had some pretty bad disasters under the Republicans.\u201d \u00a0He was being perceptive. In a 2014 paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research, Alan Blinder and Mark Watson examined every presidential administration since World War II. They concluded: \u201cThe U.S. economy has grown faster\u2014and scored higher on many other macroeconomic metrics\u2014when the president of the United States is a Democrat.\u201d Our current president would do well to heed the words of his younger self. He should embrace the Democratic policies that have helped our economy prosper and eschew the Republican policies that dragged our country into those \u201cpretty bad disasters.\u201d", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/its-obamas-economic-recovery-stupid?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kate Briquelet", "body": "Charles Harder, the attorney who destroyed Gawker, has joined President Trump\u2019s legal battle with Stormy Daniels.

Daniels argues the nondisclosure contract is void because it was signed only by Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, and not the president himself.\nCohen drafted up the agreement under a Delaware LLC, Essential Consultants, and paid Daniels $130,000 for her silence.\nA notice of removal filed by attorney Brent Blakeley, who represents Trump and Essential Consultants, states that the NDA that Daniels signed comes with stiff penalties: $1 million per breach of the confidentiality provisions.\nDaniels filed her lawsuit on March 6, knowing that Essential Consultants had initiated an arbitration proceeding on the matter, court papers allege.\nOn March 12, Daniels\u2019 attorney sent Cohen a written proposal to make the NDA \u201cnull and void\u201d in return for the $130,000 payout. \nBut, Trump\u2019s legal team argues, Daniels violated their October 2016 settlement agreement at least 20 times. They argue Essential Consultants and/or Trump can collect as much as $20 million from the porn star. \nStill, the legal filings are the closest President Trump has come to acknowledging he\u2019s the mystery man named in the NDA.\nIn the agreement, the parties used aliases: \u201cPeggy Peterson\u201d and \u201cDavid Dennison.\u201d\nDaniels\u2019 attorney, Michael Avenatti, hinted to the commander-in-chief\u2019s admission on Twitter, after the latest court filing made headlines. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

We are NOT going away and we will NOT be intimidated.\u201d\nAvenatti called the filing \u201cyet another bullying tactic from the president and Mr. Cohen\u201d that would only lead to \u201cprivate arbitration, thus hiding the truth from the public.\u201d\nThe court maneuver followed allegations Friday morning that Daniels had been threatened with \u201cphysical harm\u201d if she went public over her year-long affair with the president.\n\u201cMy client was physically threatened to stay silent about what she knew about Donald Trump,\u201d Avenatti told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo on Friday.\nSpeaking on New Day, Avenatti declined to say whether Trump or anyone close to him was behind the alleged intimidation, which he said had continued after Trump became president.

Let me put it to you this way. Which would you rather have: a bumbler who disagrees with Donald Trump from time to time, or a seemingly efficient bureaucrat who agrees with him almost all of the time? Because we had the former in Rex Tillerson, and soon, in Pompeo, we will have the latter, and that\u2019s a lot more dangerous.\nTillerson was always in over his head and always not-quite-sure what he was doing in the job. His hesitance with the press and that \u201cI\u2019d rather be golfing\u201d expression on his face marked his tenure from the start. He will not exactly live in history alongside George Marshall. \nBut whatever else we may say about him, the fired secretary of state was the Hippocrates of Foggy Bottom: He did no harm\u2014 at least in broader world, that is; he did plenty of harm inside the building, where morale was in the sewer. But he did little to make the geopolitical situation worse. Considering the man he\u2019s working for, in time we may come to appreciate that as a world-historical accomplishment. \nHe kept Trump from blowing up the Iran deal. He hewed to the traditional line on North Korea, which was no talks without some meaningful preconditions. When he got the axe, he was on his way home from a trip to Africa, where he was trying to make amends after Trump\u2019s \u201cshithole\u201d countries remark, and more specifically from Chad, where he was trying to explain to a perplexed capital why the Trump administration added Chad to the travel ban last year and offer hope that the country might be removed.\nWe won\u2019t know the whole story until the memoirs come out\u2014if he bothers\u2014but it would hardly be shocking to learn that Tillerson saved our country from a few international mini-crises.\nPompeo? By all accounts he admires Trump; is for the most part on the same page. He\u2019s been briefing the president daily. They have, as Trump said himself on Tuesday morning, \u201cchemistry.\u201d When I think about what kind of man it takes to develop \u201cchemistry\u201d with Donald Trump, and realize that that man is about to be the United States\u2019 top diplomat, it somehow leaves me less than reassured.\nPompeo will be, in all likelihood, a better manager of the department than Tillerson. He\u2019s been a congressman and he\u2019s been running the CIA. Of course, Tillerson hailed from one of the biggest private companies in the world but Pompeo also knows his way around Washington better than Tillerson did. He\u2019ll fill posts. I\u2019d bet we\u2019ll have an ambassador in Seoul now\u2014one of the more glaring empty diplomatic seats\u2014fairly soon. This is where the positive stories will come in two months from now.\nBut he\u2019ll be filling those posts with hard-liners and Trump loyalists. So now we are likely to see, in a way we did not see for these first 14 months, the president being able to execute his foreign-policy, well, vision.\nSo look for the administration to cancel the Iran deal. Pompeo has been a big critic of it. Look for a harder line, if such is possible, on Israel and the Palestinians. On Russia, Pompeo has taken a far more anti-Putin line than Trump; after all, he heads an agency that is part of the consensus view that Russia meddled in the election to help Trump. Just this past weekend Pompeo challenged Putin\u2019s dismissal of meddling claims as \u201cfalse.\u201d Will Pompeo try to persuade the president of this view, or spend the next few months trying to make his boss forget he ever held it? Count me among those skeptical that the potentially new Secretary of State won\u2019t learn the lessons from the just axed Secretary of State\u2014that fealty to Trump is the key currency. \u00a0\nSo we have no idea what we\u2019re in for. What will Pompeo\u2019s posture be on these allegedly upcoming North Korea talks? (\u201cAllegedly\u201d because I\u2019d bet there\u2019s a chance they don\u2019t actually happen.) If they\u2019re really taking place in a mere two months, that\u2019s an awfully short time for a new secretary of state and a new diplomatic team to get on the same page and try to convince the president to read a memo.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nBut Trump doesn\u2019t think about such things. Nothing about this was planned. Trump was waiting for an excuse, it seems, for a while, and Tillerson appears to him given him the excuse he needed with the Russia comments. But he doesn\u2019t think about consequences in firing his secretary of state any more than he thinks about them when accepting a no-conditions sit down with Kim Jong-Un on the spur of the moment. \nWe were spared one bullet here. Trump didn\u2019t name Tom Cotton to replace Pompeo at CIA, as expected. My guess: The Republicans didn\u2019t want to risk losing a Senate seat. If a Democrat could win in Alabama, as Doug Jones did, maybe one could win in Arkansas too. We have the Republican primary voters of Alabama to thank for that, for nominating a pervert.\nBut we have problems enough.

Devin Nunes (R-CA), alleging partisan behavior by the FBI and the Department of Justice in a \u201cDeep State\u201d conspiracy against Donald Trump is, what we would call in the CIA, \u201cdisinformation.\u201d Tougher words could be used. But let\u2019s put it simply at this: It is a deliberate diversion from the hard facts that the FBI and CIA have been amassing of Russian espionage activity with members of Donald Trump\u2019s entourage. And it presents FBI and CIA officers with a progressively grave constitutional crisis. The Nunes memo makes it difficult for those officers to serve an executive who\u2014evidence increasingly indicates\u2014has betrayed his oath to the Constitution. It also makes it hard for them to serve a legislative oversight committee that is distorting its functions so as to protect that executive. Inside the CIA, where I served for decades, and the FBI, the strongest reaction to the Nunes memo will be anger and alarm. Top officials in both those institutions operate in a manner fundamentally at odds with what is now being depicted. In the CIA, I encountered colleagues with views that ranged from the far right to far left\u2014every view except, perhaps, that of the communists. This broad diversity is also true for my colleagues in the FBI. Indeed, the \u201ccultures\u201d of both institutions are utterly apolitical. Officers take their oaths with sometimes life-sacrificing devotion: To \u201csupport and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\u201d I have been moved literally to tears on numerous occasions by my colleagues\u2019 devotion to our laws and the institutions charged with protecting them; and not to any man, be he president, general, or party leader; nor to any party. CIA and FBI officers seek to give life to James Madison\u2019s hope, expressed in Federalist #10, that our system be impartial and unaffected by non-democratic influences, and that it be \u201cmore difficult for unworthy candidates to practice the vicious arts by which elections are too often carried.\u201d They seek to make sure that no foreign power can affect our elections, plant spies among us, or even choose our leaders and shape our policies.I never saw an officer\u2019s personal views interfere with how the agency performed its duties. Personal political opinions, like cellphones and football pools, are left out of the office. This commitment and motivation is why we spend our careers working for a fraction of what our peers in the private sector earn. Nor do the CIA or the FBI as institutions have political agendas.\u00a0The idea of the \u201cDeep State\u201d opposing elected leaders and the rule of law is\u2014I will be blunt here\u2014a fascist concept, which is intended to discredit the institutions of democracy. It is done, precisely, so that a \u201cLeader\u201d can represent the \u201cpeople\u201d without the encumbrance of law or representative institutions. Most CIA and FBI officers share my alarm that such a distorting and harmful term has even entered American political discussions. Those who use the term \u201cDeep State\u201d frankly disqualify themselves from public life in a democracy. If anything, the Nunes memorandum shows how carefully the FBI, CIA, and Department of Justice protect an individual from any official abuse. The memorandum notes that at least five senior officials, from three separate departments, on seven different occasions, every 90 days, had to review the FBI\u2019s request to investigate Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. That was before they passed the request to the separate Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court that grants or denies the requests. And all of this occurred each time after officers in the rank and file of the FBI had themselves judged that there was sufficient probable cause of espionage activity to merit the request. I have lived this process. Its multiple levels of review make it just about certain that FISA requests are based on solid concern about foreign intelligence activity. So, I can state with confidence that the reaction in the FBI and the CIA to the Nunes memorandum will be disdain for what Madison calls, the \u201cvicious arts\u201d in it. It will be seen for what it truly is: an attempt to protect what appears to be the Trump entourages\u2019 ties to Russian intelligence.

But the agency is highly mindful of the political consequences for the generation of officers that took part in the program, which is one reason why it waged such vociferous opposition to the Senate intelligence committee\u2019s investigation of torture. (Ironically, Haspel and her boss Jose Rodriguez\u2019s fateful decision to destroy the torture tapes directly prompted the Senate investigation.) \nNow comes Haspel, a career CIA official by all accounts well respected by her colleagues over a 30-plus year career. She\u2019s the first CIA director nominee since William Colby in the 1970s who would come to the job directly from the agency ranks without time on the outside\u200d. Accordingly, former senior intelligence luminaries have lined up behind her, suggesting in a Cipher Brief roundtable that she\u2019ll be a counterweight to Trump deeply trusted by Langley and downplaying her role in torture. (\u201cGina Haspel did precisely what the agency and the nation asked her to do,\u201d wrote Mike Hayden, who presided over the terminal phase of the torture program as CIA director.) \nWhile some officials involved in the legal aspects of the torture program have been nominated for higher appointments, Haspel would be the first such nominee who played an operational role in mock executions and waterboarding. To civil liberties groups, the message a Haspel directorship would send to that generation of CIA officers is \u201cthat torture, or other activity outside the bounds of the law, is not a career-killer,\u201d according to Christopher Anders, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Washington office. \nAnd it\u2019s not just any president who has nominated Haspel. Trump as a candidate spoke rapturously about implementing torture worse than waterboarding, and only Defense Secretary Jim Mattis appears to have swayed Trump. But now that Trump is ousting moderates like Rex Tillerson and elevating hardliners like Mike Pompeo \u2013 who as a congressman adopted an anti-anti-torture posture \u2013 \u201cher appointment as CIA director could lead to a reemergence of torture, either as a matter of policy or in practice,\u201d said Dixon. (Congress in 2015 reiterated the illegality of torture, but civil libertarians are quick to note that torture was illegal when the CIA enacted the Bush-era program in 2002.) \nThe civil-libertarian plan to defeat Haspel is still coalescing, as is its membership. Thus far on board ae Human Rights First, Human Rights Watch, the Center for Victims of Torture, the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, the ACLU, Center for Constitutional Rights, Demand Progress, Open the Government and Amnesty International (where, full disclosure, this reporter\u2019s wife is a senior executive). Some of the campaigns contours are becoming clear as well. \nLater this week, an open letter to the Senate will emerge from many of these prominent civil libertarian groups. It will call for senators to seek a substantial declassification of what, exactly, Haspel did at the Thailand black site she oversaw for Abu Zubaydah and Nashiri\u2019s interrogation. By the CIA\u2019s design, the public record is full of discrepancies and obfuscations, including those within the declassified text of the Senate torture report and the agency\u2019s prevention of Haspel\u2019s deposition in a torture lawsuit. (Similarly, a book from CIA contractor James Mitchell, a co-defendant in that suit that includes a quote from a figure who might be Haspel\u200d mocking a tortured Abu Zubaydah, but it\u2019s not clear.) The groups will argue that those gaps are untenable for oversight of a potential CIA director.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe confirmation hearings are going to be a bad joke if stuff isn\u2019t declassified,\u201d said Katherine Hawkins of the Project on Government Oversight, one of the most tenacious outside investigators of CIA torture. Hawkins, also part of the coalition to defeat Haspel, plans on drafting questions to ask Haspel for Senate staff. \nIn addition to fanning out to the airwaves to warn against Haspel, the groups are targeting key senators, and they see favorable math. They got a big boost on Wednesday, when Kentucky Republican Rand Paul came out against Haspel. In a 51-49 Republican Senate majority, Haspel\u2019s nomination is no sure bet even before the fight begins in earnest. \nBut that depends on the civil libertarians convincing Democrats to stand together against Haspel \u2013 and that\u2019s far from a certain thing, thanks in part to the reflexive fear amongst Democratic leaders about getting tarred as weak on security. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that he\u2019s not instructing Democrats to oppose her \u201cat this point.\u201d And many civil libertarians were disappointed \u2013 even shocked \u2013 that the leading figure behind the torture report, Democrat Dianne Feinstein, did not reject Haspel out of hand, even as she seeks reelection this year in deep-blue California.\nFeinstein told The Daily Beast on Wednesday that she \u201cnever announces a view before the hearing.\u201d\nShe continued: \u201cNo one could doubt how much I care. And anyone that knows what we went through to get this report to see the light of day will understand that. Like everybody, I have to do my due diligence. And I don\u2019t just make a kneejerk opinion. I wait, because I\u2019m on the [Senate intelligence] committee and I have an opportunity to ask questions to do just that,\u201d Feinstein said. \nBut now Paul is to Feinstein\u2019s left on Haspel. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if she has the courage of her convictions to actually vote no,\u201d Paul jabbed on Wednesday. \nCivil libertarians are also looking to a torture survivor to give a few Republicans cover to break with the White House on Haspel and to shore up Democrats: Arizona Republican John McCain. McCain stopped just short of opposing Haspel on Tuesday and called on her to \u201cexplain the nature and extent of her involvement\u201d in torture. Along with Feinstein, McCain was the architect of the successful 2015 amendment formally prohibiting the CIA from returning to torture, so the civil libertarians consider McCain persuadable as a substantial voice against Haspel.\nThe groups believe they have some recent history is on their side. Last year, they came just short of stopping Steven Bradbury, a Bush-era Justice Department official who lent his legal imprimatur to CIA torture, from becoming the senior attorney at the Department of Transportation. Bradbury won 50-47, but all Democrats who voted were against him, as were McCain and Paul. And that was for a position unrelated to national security featuring a nominee without an operational role in torture. Additionally, the McCain-Feinstein amendment passed in 2015 by a wide margin, 78 to 21.\nCivil libertarian groups do not win many major congressional battles. Capitol Hill is typically favorable territory for the security agencies, as crossing them opens politicians up to demagoguery. Liz Cheney, a Wyoming congresswoman whose father Dick was a pivotal architect of the torture program, tweeted that Paul was \u201cdefending and sympathizing with terrorists\u201d by criticizing Haspel.\nBut whether they can succeed against Haspel or not, the civil liberties groups feel they cannot sit out a fight to prevent a woman deeply involved with acts like stuffing a wounded man into a box barely larger than a coffin and threatening another captive with a pistol from running the CIA. \n\u201cEveryone is super revved up on this,\u201d said Human Right First\u2019s Wala. \u201cTorture is the quintessential human rights violation.

That office declined to comment, telling The Daily Beast on Friday that it does not confirm or deny the existence of ongoing investigations.\nShulkin, an Obama-era holdover, is already on thin ice with the White House owing to a separate IG report last month, which found that he improperly expended taxpayer resources so that his wife could join him on a trip to Europe last summer. During that trip, both Shulkin and his wife attended the Wimbledon tennis tournament, claiming (it appears falsely) that they were provided the tickets by a family friend. That report also found that Shulkin\u2019s chief of staff had forged an email, ostensibly showing that Shulkin was slated to receive an award from the Danish government, in order to create a post-facto pretext for his wife\u2019s attendance.\nShulkin\u2019s attorneys vehemently disputed the IG\u2019s findings, and the secretary suggested that his chief of staff\u2019s email account may have been hacked. The IG\u2019s office released a letter this week saying there was no evidence of such an electronic intrusion.\nPublicly, the administration remains fully behind Shulkin. Veterans service organizations met with White House chief of staff John Kelly in the West Wing\u2019s Roosevelt Room on Monday. A source present at the meeting, also attended by Domestic Policy Council director Andrew Bremberg and Office of Public Liaison Deputy Director Jennifer Korn, told The Daily Beast that Kelly expressed the Trump White House\u2019s full \u201cconfidence in\u201d Shulkin and shot down any suggestion that he would be ousted from his position.\nThe White House press office referred questions about the forthcoming report to the VA.

The White House has had to intervene to prevent Shulkin from firing a number of senior political appointees, according to one source familiar with the situation.\nAmong those in Shulkin\u2019s crosshairs is John Ullyot, the VA's assistant secretary for public affairs, who has been trying to convince lawmakers on Capitol Hill to call the White House and explicitly recommend sacking the secretary, according to a USA Today report that also mentioned Cashour by name. (Both denied the report, saying they had never recommended that their boss be removed.) Others who Shulkin views as prominent adversaries are Darin Selnick, a White House veterans affairs adviser, and Jake Leinenkugel, a White House senior adviser on veterans affairs, both of whom Shulkin has reportedly blamed for attempting to subvert or undermine his authority.\nOutside of the building, Shulkin\u2019s standing is precarious. Rep. Mike Coffman, a Colorado Republican on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, officially called for the secretary\u2019s replacement this week in a letter to President Donald Trump.\nBut Shulkin retains some powerful allies in Congress too, including Rep.

Fox News and CNN reported that Trump\u2019s appointed FBI director, Chris Wray, ventured to Capitol Hill on Sunday to view the memo\u2014another sign that both sides were attempting to reconcile differences that emerged into public view last week. On Wednesday, as House Republicans led a groundswell to, as they put it, #ReleaseTheMemo, the Justice Department\u2019s Hill liaison warned a declassification of the memo that sidestepped the FBI and the department would be \u201cextraordinarily reckless.\u201d \u00a0At issue is a memo prepared by Republican chairman Devin Nunes, who has previously cooperated in secret with White House officials to undermine the Russia inquiries, that purportedly claims Justice Department and FBI officials manipulated the process to surveil suspected assets of a foreign power within the United States. The White House views it as exculpation that senior officials involved in the Russia probe harbor bias against President Trump. According to the Washington Post, Trump views it as a potential pretext for firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees special counsel \u00a0Robert Mueller and has pledged to safeguard Mueller\u2019s independence. In a statement last week, all the Democrats on the intelligence committee called the memo \u201ca misleading set of talking points attacking the FBI\u201d for the political goal of \u201cspreading a false narrative and undermining legitimate investigations.\u201d Declassifying the Nunes memo in the absence of Justice Department-FBI guidance risks revealing information relevant to counterintelligence and providing active or potential surveillance targets with tips for circumventing investigations. The Justice Department\u2019s Stephen Boyd, in his letter last week to the committee, said the department and the bureau sought to review the memo in order to advise on \u201cthe risk of harm to national security and to ongoing investigations that could come from public release.\u201d Representatives for Nunes and Texas Republican Mike Conaway, who is helming the panel\u2019s Russia probe, did not respond to inquiries. The FBI declined to comment. Named in the memorandum are recent targets of Trump and the House Republicans, as The Daily Beast first reported: Rosenstein; FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe; and James Comey, the FBI director Trump fired over the Russia inquiry. The Republicans\u2019 declassification efforts come while Mueller is seeking to interview Trump about firing Comey, the Washington Post reported, though it is unclear if the president\u2019s legal team will assent. \u00a0The New York Times reported that the memo blames Rosenstein for seeking renewal of an already-authorized surveillance warrant against Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page. McCabe has been a target of Trump\u2019s ire since it emerged that his wife received financial contributions for an unsuccessful Virginia state Senate bid as a Democrat from Terry McAuliffe, then the Virginia governor and a close ally of the Clintons, before McCabe oversaw the Hillary Clinton private-email-server investigation. Hours before the House committee meeting, McCabe stepped down from his FBI responsibilities, something long forecasted in preparation for his long-scheduled retirement, but occurring as McCabe is in the center of a political storm. Axios reported that Wray refused to fire McCabe at Trump\u2019s behest\u2014even threatening to quit. It is an extraordinary fight for the House Republicans on the panel to wage. The House intelligence committee typically gives the prerogatives of the intelligence agencies a wide berth\u2014particularly over securing classified information, and especially over the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which governs the highly sensitive processes for investigating possible U.S.-based spies.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The senior Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, Mark Warner of Virginia, who has viewed the underlying surveillance information that the memo purportedly summarizes, told Politico that the memo was \u201cconnecting dots that don\u2019t connect.\u201dThe House intelligence committee\u2019s Democrats have prepared an alternative memo intended to refute the one Nunes compiled. They are expected to seek declassification of that memo during the Monday afternoon hearing as well, though it is unclear that they possess the votes to do so, or have themselves avoided the disclosure of surveillance information should they prevail.Even if the House intelligence committee votes to declassify the Nunes memo, the process will take at least several days to result in the memo\u2019s release. A little-exercised rule of the House provides for five days for the president to register objections to declassification before the full House can take a vote on release. A White House official indicated to CNN that Trump is prepared to override Justice Department reluctance to release the memo.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/fbi-scrambling-to-get-more-info-on-explosive-nunes-memo-ahead-of-vote-to-release-it?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Andrew Desiderio", "body": "A key Democratic lawmaker on Monday vowed to significantly ramp up his efforts to build support for bipartisan legislation that would shield special counsel Robert Mueller from political interference, amid renewed attacks on the Russia investigation from President Donald Trump and his legal team.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the statements and actions from the president and his lawyer over the weekend have led me to believe that the special counsel is now at real, immediate risk of being removed, and I believe the Senate needs to pass legislation to ensure that does not happen,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) said.\nCoons, one of the chief architects of a bipartisan bill that would institute judicial review for any attempt to fire a special counsel, said he plans to \u201cspeak individually with as many of my colleagues as possible to build support for this effort.\u201d\nBut the new push comes as many Democrats have already resigned themselves to the fact that despite Trump\u2019s and his lawyer\u2019s most recent attacks on the special counsel\u2019s investigation, which have escalated the months-long effort to discredit the probe from the president and his allies in the media, Republicans and their leaders on Capitol Hill aren\u2019t on board with a legislative response\u2014prompting some to look for other avenues to preserve Mueller\u2019s investigation.\nAside from legislation, lawmakers have begun discussing joint letters or floor speeches as a way to \u201csend a strong signal\u201d to Trump.\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that we can make progress on that bill,\u201d Coons told The Daily Beast. \u201cI just had a number of conversations on the floor, and I think there are several senators in both parties who are looking for ways to convey to the president how seriously we take the threats to the special counsel.\u201d\nDemocrats\u2019 frustrations with the lack of progress on legislation come as Republicans remain unconvinced that Trump would actually move to thwart or end Mueller\u2019s investigation\u2014despite heightened attacks on the probe, which is looking into Russian election meddling and possible Trump-Russia collusion. They\u2019ve relied instead on the White House\u2019s insistence that Trump is not considering taking such action, and some have cited conversations with the president or his staff to conclude that Mueller isn\u2019t in any real danger.\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about it at all,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) said. \u201cI think it\u2019d be a big mistake and I think that\u2019s the kind of advice he\u2019s getting from everybody. \u2026 The consequences would be so overwhelming that it\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201d\nThe president and his legal team continued over the weekend to toughen their posture toward the special counsel\u2019s investigation. On Saturday, John Dowd, a lawyer on the president\u2019s team, told The Daily Beast that the probe should be shut down. While Dowd later said he was speaking only for himself, Trump followed suit in a series of tweets later that same day \u00a0attacking the integrity of the probe. And on Monday, Trump\u2019s legal team brought on Joseph diGenova, who has pushed a conspiracy theory about the president being \u201cframed\u201d by the FBI and the Justice Department.\nIn January, Coons\u2019 Republican counterpart, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), appeared to back off his own legislation to protect Mueller\u2019s probe. Daniel Keylin, a spokesman for the senator, told The Daily Beast at the time that \u201cthe president and his administration have spoken favorably of Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s professionalism and integrity,\u201d and that talk of firing Mueller \u201chas completely come to a halt.\u201d\nOn Monday, Tillis joined the Republican chorus of support for Mueller\u2019s investigation after Trump\u2019s Tweets deeming it a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d that \u201cshould never have been started.\u201d But Tillis said that there wasn\u2019t an \u201cimminent need\u201d to pass his legislation \u201ctoday or this week,\u201d as some lawmakers have floated the possibility of adding special counsel protection language to the massive spending bill Congress is considering this week. Eventually, Tillis said, the legislation should move forward \u201cas a matter of good governance.\u201d\nMany of his Republican colleagues disagree. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who co-authored a separate piece of legislation with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) aimed at protecting Mueller, has also backed away from his own bill in recent months, saying he remains confident that Trump wouldn\u2019t move against the special counsel.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not at all [concerned]. That\u2019s exactly what they did with Ken Starr,\u201d Graham said on Monday, referring to the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton. \u201cDemocrats went after Ken Starr saying it\u2019s a witch hunt. Nobody talked about firing Ken Starr. And unless there\u2019s some reason to fire Mueller, that's not going to happen. And I don\u2019t see a reason\u2014but you can expect Trump and other folks to go after Mueller. Democrats went after Ken Starr.\u201d\nWhen asked why he introduced legislation in the first place, Graham responded: \u201cJust to let people know where I stand.\u201d\nEven some of the president\u2019s most hardened critics aren\u2019t on board with a legislative response. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) said he has constitutional concerns with the two bills being considered, but thinks Republican leadership should preemptively speak out against a Mueller firing more forcefully than they have in the past.\n\u201cSome of us have spoken out. Everybody needs to\u2014strongly. I would hope that our leadership would come out and say this is a red line you can\u2019t go past,\u201d Flake said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to pick a fight, this is a fight to pick. You\u2019ve got to pick this fight. If you don\u2019t pick this fight, we might as well not be here. This is a serious one.\u201d\nA few Republican lawmakers did speak out more aggressively in the aftermath of the White House offensive this weekend, with Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) saying: \u201cIf you have an innocent client, Mr. Dowd, act like it.\u201d Others echoed Gowdy, arguing that Trump shouldn\u2019t attack the investigation if he truly believes he is innocent.\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that \u201cthe best thing for him as president\u2014since after almost one year there\u2019s been no show of collusion\u2014it seems to me like he\u2019s coming out looking pretty good at this point and that he ought to just let it play out.\u201d\nGrassley\u2019s panel has been working for months to reconcile the two bills intended to protect Mueller\u2019s probe into one, but that effort appears stalled.", "link": null, "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Noah Shachtman", "body": "Rex Tillerson was not a Middle Eastern dictator. But the American diplomats he used to lead are practically shooting off celebratory gunfire now that his statue has been toppled from Donald Trump\u2019s Washington. \n\u201cOn Tillerson: hallelujah!\u201d one State Department official said. \nState Department staffers who talked to The Daily Beast described the secretary of state\u2019s downfall as a liberation \u2013 even as they grimly recognized that recent history, literal and metaphorical, suggests that what follows liberation is chaos and occupation. \nWhile career State Department officials have a highly difficult relationship with the president, whose approaches on everything from refugees to Russia to race relations have prompted a wave of diplomatic departures, they are in lockstep with Trump over hating Tillerson \u2013 though for much different reasons. Trump\u2019s relationship with Tillerson, sources tell The Daily Beast, was further damaged after Tillerson distanced himself from Trump\u2019s public sympathies with the violent white supremacists parading through Charlottesville last August.\n\n\u201cPeople had sort of thought that Trump had just forgotten about firing Tillerson.\u201d\n\u2014 State Department official\n\nWhatever reputation for understatedness diplomats possess went out the door throughout Tillerson\u2019s calamitous State Department tenure. State Department officials were horrified by what they perceived as his disdain for them. His reforms left many experienced diplomats internally marginalized \u2013 with little to do but vent to reporters about Tillerson presiding over a decline of American diplomacy that many felt was the entire point of his tenure. \nTillerson was widely loathed for his deep budget cuts; an institutional realignment that many diplomats felt came at their expense; and an inner circle that longtime officials considered to hoard information to the point of insulating Tillerson from the concerns they had about the direction of U.S. foreign policy. \nAs news of Tillerson\u2019s ouster spread on Tuesday morning\u2014as Tillerson was supposed to be wrapping up a weeklong trip to five African countries\u2014diplomats who talked to The Daily Beast whipsawed between euphoria at his departure and fear about their likely new boss, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, emboldening Trump\u2019s ignorance, bellicosity and impulsiveness. \n\u201cTillerson kept a lot of the crazy in check and was obviously a moderating voice. But he never had the ear of [Trump], had a bad relationship with [national security adviser H.R.] McMaster and was a horrendous manager,\u201d said a second current State Department official.\nThe first State Department official said that Foggy Bottom should \u201cbuckle up\u201d for its incoming chief, Pompeo. \n\u201cWhile Pompeo gives reason for pause, one can have reasonable confidence he won\u2019t sideline the expertise of the building in favor of a handful of ill-equipped \u2018advisers\u2019 with limited experience and a disdain for career professionals,\u201d this official continued.\n\n\u201cPompeo will have the president\u2019s trust but enable his worst foreign policy instincts. Sanity has never been the guiding principle of this White House.\u201d\n\u2014 State Department official\n\nThat diplomat\u2019s confidence is going to come under pressure in the very near future. Pompeo has Trump\u2019s confidence, and is also one of the administration\u2019s leading hawks. While at the CIA, Pompeo acquired a quick reputation for distorting internal analysis to favor Trump and his predilections. In October, Pompeo publicly stated that Russian interference in the 2016 election \u2013 which the CIA has assessed occurred despite Trump\u2019s denials \u2013 \u00a0\u201cdid not affect the outcome,\u201d a conclusion the agency never in fact reached and about which it remains agnostic. \n\u201cPompeo will have the president\u2019s trust but enable his worst foreign policy instincts. Sanity has never been the guiding principle of this White House,\u201d the second diplomat said.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nA different State Department official said there was internal speculation that Pompeo would bring aboard a senior official at the State adjunct USAID, Jim Richardson, who was \u201cnot well liked.\u201d In a brazen move in January, Richardson had suspended all USAID cooperation with Tillerson and Ciccone\u2019s redesign out of concern for the future of the agency. While many inside State also disagree with the redesign, Richardson was \u201crepeatedly pissing off\u201d department officials with what some saw as a budgetary grab that would undermine the secretary of state\u2019s influence. But Richardson used to serve as Pompeo\u2019s chief of staff, prompting early speculation that Pompeo would elevate him to the seventh floor of Foggy Bottom.\nIronically for a career oilman who received an order of friendship from Vladimir Putin, Tillerson had become far more outspoken about Russian interference in the election than his former boss. In an internal December forum at Foggy Bottom, which quickly leaked to The Daily Beast, Tillerson referred openly to Moscow as having \u201cinterfered in democratic processes here.\u201d Tillerson\u2019s final statement as secretary of state, issued Monday night after UK Prime Minister Theresa May blamed Putin for the London assassination of a former Russian spy, accused Russia of being an \u201cirresponsible force of instability in the world, acting with open disregard for the sovereignty of other states and the life of their citizens.\u201d \nPutin said jokingly last September he had come to regret giving Tillerson the award.\nTillerson has been all but persona non grata with Trump ever since reportedly calling the president a \u201cfucking moron\u201d and then pointedly declining to personally deny saying it. But even some at State were somewhat empathetic toward Tillerson for the disrespect Trump returned by firing him while Tillerson was on foreign travel, and just weeks after Tillerson\u2019s father passed away.\nThat disrespect had become the norm for the Trump-Tillerson relationship. For months, Trump practically delighted in shutting down Tillerson in public. After Tillerson made a public overture to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, offering to \u201ctalk about the weather\u201d during a December speech, the White House put out a statement saying its hardline position on North Korea was unaffected. Then this month, Trump stunned the world by accepting an overture from Kim for direct leader-to-leader talks \u2013 which cut Tillerson out and contradicted the secretary\u2019s attempts to row back toward Trump\u2019s position. (\u201cNorth Korea must earn its way back to the table,\u201d Tillerson had said three days after his upbraiding.) \nIt was only one example of Trump gelding a secretary he had personally plucked from the leadership of ExxonMobil. Like an autocrat, Trump had given his son-in-law Jared Kushner a wide foreign-policy portfolio, with substantial and personal influence over critical relationships with Israel and Saudi Arabia. Tillerson\u2019s first trip to Iraq as secretary, where the U.S. was engaged in a shooting war with the Islamic State, occurred in October; Kushner visited in April. In June, Trump defended a blockade of Qatar by other U.S. Gulf partners that Tillerson had sought to end. \u00a0\n\n\u201cAfter Tillerson's Charlottesville comment, there was an effort on the part of White House officials to cut State officials out of meetings. The \u2018cold shoulder got a bit colder,\u2019 the current official said.\u201d\n\nBut in retrospect, according to knowledgeable current and former officials, the Trump-Tillerson relationship was doomed, in part, by the president\u2019s infamous Charlottesville equivalency between anti-racist protesters and the violent white supremacists Trump said included \u201cvery fine people.\u201d\nTillerson was livid, and considered resigning, according to one former senior State Department official. Instead, the ordinarily taciturn, press-averse Tillerson agreed to appear on the Sunday shows\u2014where he tacitly condemned Trump\u2019s remarks. \u201cThe president speaks for himself,\u201d he told Fox News Sunday.\nTrump and White House officials fumed over Tillerson\u2019s refusal to stick up for the president, according to multiple administration sources, and helped cement his reputation in the West Wing as, at the very least, not somebody who could be counted on as a \u201cteam player,\u201d one West Wing official noted.\n\u201cIt was a shot across the bow. The first time publicly that he had broken with the president. It shook the White House. Everybody watched that and knew exactly what he was saying,\u201d added the former State Department official.\nAfter Tillerson's Charlottesville comment, there was an effort on the part of White House officials to cut State officials out of meetings, according to a current and a former senior Trump administration official. Since the dawn of the Trump era, Tillerson's State Department had already been sidelined in various ways and, post-Charlottesville, the \u201ccold shoulder got a bit colder,\u201d the current official said.\nState Department officials began to find themselves left out of key inter-agency conversations. Staffers who left State to join other, smaller agencies found themselves with better White House access than they had before.\nThat explains some of the relief expressed by current and former Foggy Bottom staffers. But even those happy to see Tillerson go couldn\u2019t help but note how badly this would scar him. \n\u201cThis is the last thing he [Tillerson] wanted,\u201d the former State Department official said. \u201cHe wanted to go a long time ago himself. He didn\u2019t know why he wanted this job. He realized very quickly he was not the right fit. You can tell.\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t leave last summer is to prevent this,\u201d the former official added. \u201cHe wanted to control his own exit. He was so hellbent on protecting his legacy that he wanted to control his own exit. Because of the pride.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are hated inside State and by the White House, almost universally seen as incompetent.\u201d\n\u2014 State Department official\n\nTillerson loyalists ensured that their boss did not leave without inflicting harm on Trump in return. On Tuesday morning, Undersecretary Steve Goldstein said on the record that Tillerson \u201chad every intention of remaining\u201d in office and \u201cdid not speak to the president this morning and is unaware of the reason\u201d for his firing. Within hours, the Associated Press reported, Goldstein was fired.\nTillerson, in an impromptu, eight-minute farewell statement at Foggy Bottom, took subliminal shot after subliminal shot at Trump. His voice catching, he did not even pretend to thank Trump for the opportunity to serve as secretary, instead thanking \u201call of you\u201d in the American public. \nIn remarks formally aimed at the diplomats who loathe him, Tillerson said the world needs \u201cselfless leaders like these\u201d and people who treat \u201ceach other with honesty and integrity\u201d at the helm of the country. He repeatedly praised the importance of traditional allies and partners,\u201d leaving unsaid Trump\u2019s disrespect for them. He warned Russia\u2019s \u201ccurrent trajectory\u201d would lead to its \u201cfurther isolation\u201d and sought a relationship with China \u201cfree of conflict,\u201d remarks at odds with both Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for a trade war with Beijing and the National Security Strategy, authored by national security adviser H.R. McMaster, that considers both countries adversaries. Tillerson praised Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford, the military broadly\u2014but not McMaster.\nOfficials at State were hoping that Tillerson\u2019s inner circle, particularly powerful chief of staff Margaret Peterlin, senior policy adviser Brian Hook and Christine Ciccone, who has running an internally-despised departmental \u201credesign,\u201d were next to depart. Peterlin in particular is said by multiple sources to have a rocky relationship with McMaster, as did Tillerson. \n\u201cThey are hated inside State and by the White House, almost universally seen as incompetent,\u201d the first State Department official said. \nThough Trump cultivated a reality-show reputation as a decisive boss, Trump chafes at the idea of firing people in person and prefers they simply solve personnel problems for him without confrontation. Tillerson apparently learned about his firing from a presidential tweet. \n\u201cRex is a very good man, I like Rex a lot, I really appreciate his commitment and his service, and I\u2019ll be speaking to Rex over a long period of time,\u201d Trump said on Tuesday.\nAccording to two sources who\u2019ve spoken with Trump in recent weeks about Tillerson, the president would privately knock the intelligence and acumen of his own top diplomat, and vent about what Trump and senior White House staff would often see as Tillerson\u2019s tendency to speak for the country on the international stage\u2014in essence, upstaging the president. Trump would express bitterness at what he interpreted as Tillerson \u201cthink[ing] he knew better\u201d than the president on foreign policy and high-stakes negotiations, including on North Korea and the Iran nuclear deal. \n\n\u201cThis is the last thing he [Tillerson] wanted... He wanted to control his own exit. He was so hellbent on protecting his legacy that he wanted to control his own exit. Because of the pride.\u201d\n\u2014 former State Department official\n\nThe Daily Beast reported in October that several senior Trump aides were actively hoping Tillerson would resign late last year after word of the \u201cfucking moron\u201d quote broke. \u201cPeople in [the White House] who are loyal to the president think Rex Tillerson hates [Trump],\u201d one White House official told The Daily Beast at the time.\nEven as Tillerson\u2019s ouster has been rumored for months, leaks about it had recently abated and many at the State Department were taken by surprise. Several diplomats did not even know their boss was out until reporters called them. As of 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, the State Department had issued no internal guidance, another State Department source told The Daily Beast. \n\u201cPeople had sort of thought that Trump had just forgotten about firing him,\u201d the source said.\n\u2014with additional reporting by Sam Stein", "link": null, "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Barrett Holmes", "body": "In an act of retribution against Delta Air Lines\u2019 decision last Friday to stop providing discounts to NRA members, Georgia\u2019s state legislature on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly to pass a bill that stripped away a $50 million sales-tax exemption on jet fuel. Delta is far and away the biggest airline in the state so it would have been the main beneficiary of the exemption. \nPolitical revenge and attacking major businesses has now become the modus operandi of the supposedly pro-business GOP, and Georgians should be appalled at the lengths their political leaders will go to defend the NRA.\nI was born and raised in Georgia and it is difficult to exaggerate the significance of Delta in the state. Atlanta has been Delta\u2019s headquarters since 1941, and the airline just signed a 20-year extension to its lease at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. That would make nearly a century of Delta calling Atlanta home.\nDelta is also Georgia\u2019s #1 private employer with 33,000 employees, and Delta is directly responsible for $43.5 billion in economic impact in the state each year. When it started it was a little regional airline. By the 1980s it was a titan, flying all over the world. If you live in and move around Atlanta, it is impossible to not know someone employed by Delta, and as a kid growing up in the Atlanta suburbs I had plenty of friends whose parents worked for Delta.\nAlso, I\u2019m a kid of the 80s and 90s. This era was defined by a celebration of Atlanta\u2019s diversity and a city-wide commitment to turning Atlanta into a city with global influence. Ted Turner created CNN in the 80s, and the network\u2019s coverage of the first Iraq War in the early 90s made Atlanta the headquarters of world cable news at the time. The Braves won the World Series in 1995, and the Olympics came to town in 1996--a staggering achievement for a Southern American city, which not so long before, historically speaking, was an apartheid city.\n\n\u201cGeorgia\u2019s Republicans have no desire to serve the public and only care about sustaining their privilege.\u201d\n\nThis was a magical time in Atlanta, and Delta was right there. Atlanta had long been Delta\u2019s primary hub, and as the city grew, so did our airport, and so did Delta. By 1998, Hartsfield-Jackson had become the busiest airport in the world, and Delta had become emblematic of Atlanta\u2019s global reach and ambitions. No corporation, not even Coca Cola, based in the city since its 1886 inception, so symbolized Atlanta's cosmopolitan progress.\nAnd now, despite Delta\u2019s transformational impact on the state, Georgia\u2019s Republican legislators have chosen the NRA over the airline. They chose guns and white privilege over economic growth and international prestige. The NRA\u2019s mostly white members and the conservatives who support them see discounts, partnerships, and privilege as an essential component of their way of life, regardless of the impact of their actions or the toxicity of their beliefs. This can\u2019t be overlooked.\nThis sordid affair began on Monday when Georgia\u2019s Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle tweeted, \u201cI will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA. Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back.\u201d\nConsidering the high volume of outlandish tweets that regularly come from the White House and the GOP, many did not think much of Cagle\u2019s bravado at first. Most questioned the legal implications of his statement and wondered if it was a violation of the First Amendment or simply blatant corruption.\nBut with the short-sighted, hypocritical determination that remains particular to today\u2019s GOP, Cagle convinced the Republican-controlled legislature to remove the sales-tax exemption on jet fuel from their previously approved tax bill. Georgia\u2019s Republican Governor Nathan Deal says that he will sign the bill, despite being frustrated by the \u201cantics\u201d of his fellow Republicans.\nDeal isn\u2019t the only person frustrated by the \u201cantics\u201d of the Republican Party, but Americans can ill afford to enable the GOP and their dangerous pro-gun, NRA supporting agenda.\nFollowing the Parkland, Fla. shooting, \u00a0over a dozen businesses have severed ties \u00a0with the NRA or implemented restrictions on gun purchases. Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods has stopped selling the assault-style rifles including the AR-15 used in the massacre. Walmart has also raised the age limit to purchase a gun or ammunition to 21. United Airlines also followed Delta\u2019s lead and stopped providing NRA members with discounts. But Cagle didn\u2019t attack United or any of the other companies that have changed course following the Parkland shooting.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nCagle\u2019s attack on Delta was clearly a petty, personal political attack against a major Atlanta business, and it speaks to a type of corruption and systemic white privilege that has largely become re-normalized in America. \nCagle is furious that the NRA will no longer receive special treatment from Delta. Delta has not said that it will deny services to the NRA, create specific NRA member sections at the back of the plane, or invoke its corporate religious beliefs to treat NRA members as second-class citizens. Delta has merely ended its affiliation with another company while remaining neutral on the issue of gun rights.\nAfter Delta\u2019s decision to remove a sliver of privilege from the NRA, Cagle responded by saying that \u201cdiscrimination against law-abiding gun owners will not solve the problem.\u201d\nNote: For Cagle and the rest of Georgia\u2019s Republican Party, a loss of privilege \u2014 even on something as minor as group discounts on airfare \u2014 equates to discrimination. As an African American who grew up in South, I\u2019ve regularly encountered white Southerners who rail against a loss of privilege as an attack on their freedoms. The prioritization of whiteness, the expectation of favors, or a quid pro quo amongst business elites, who almost always are white, has become the expected norm of society.\nThis standard consumes the entire region and infects all walks of life, even those situations that are not overtly racist. It creates a coterie of political and business elites more consumed with sustaining their power and privilege than serving the public\u2019s interests.\nDelta broke this unspoken rule, and it is now being punished for it to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. Georgia\u2019s Republicans could not care less about gun control and would rather spend time attacking a company that supports 33,000 jobs and generates billions of dollars in revenue each year.\nGeorgia\u2019s Republicans have no desire to serve the public and only care about sustaining their privilege. As a Georgian, I doubt that Delta will leave the state anytime soon. It is almost unimaginable, and the economic impact would be devastating. But if Georgia\u2019s conservatives continue to attack it and undermine Delta\u2019s business in defense of white privilege I would not begrudge Delta leaving.

By the end of his first year in office, President Barack Obama had held 11 solo press conferences; President George W. Bush had held five.Asked whether Trump plans to hold press conferences in the near future, or ever, the White House disputed the notion that the president\u2019s historic scarcity of traditional press availability indicated a scarcity of overall press availability.\u201cThe president and his administration have been one of the accessible administrations,\u201d White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters told The Daily Beast. \u201cThe president frequently holds impromptu gaggles, takes questions from the pool and engages daily with the American people.\u201dTrump has indeed answered questions from members of the press in other settings, primarily in informal gaggles with the White House press pool\u2014a rotating group of correspondents who document the president\u2019s daily movements and occasionally get locked in rooms with plastic bags covering the windows while he golfs. On some occasions, the president will spontaneously answer a shouted question as he boards Marine One, or even turn chance encounters with the press pool into miniature pressers.The president has also appeared in 22 \u201ctwo-and-two\u201d joint press conferences with other world leaders, in which each official calls on two reporters of their choosing\u2014roughly in line with the number of such such conferences by his recent predecessors.Trump frequently uses the two-and-two format to allow questions from friendlier outlets. His tendency to grant the first question to Fox News\u2019 John Roberts is a running joke in the press corps: During a September 2017 question-and-answer session alongside the emir of Kuwait, Trump withdrew a question from Roberts by saying, \u201cActually, we\u2019ll go to somebody else this time, John. You\u2019ve been doing enough.\u201dBut Trump\u2019s fitful engagements with the press\u2014seemingly random, often rushed, and held entirely on his own terms\u2014represent a departure from the relationship past presidents had with the people assigned to cover the White House.\u201cThere\u2019s value in those nontraditional exchanges,\u201d Margaret Talev, White House correspondent for Bloomberg and president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, told The Daily Beast. \u201cBut we also really encourage this president, and any American president, to hold open, normal news conferences, because they are of real value to the American public.\u201dThe president\u2019s hesitance to engage directly with members of the press outside informal gaggles is a shift in communications strategy from his freewheeling presidential campaign, when Trump was refreshingly available and candid with the press.

In fact, the president has gone as far as to express doubts to aides and friends about the assault allegations, and has asked repeatedly if there are any reasons Porter\u2019s two ex-wives could have to make up such claims, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the conversations.Trump\u2019s skepticism has been apparent in discussions with confidants and officials, who tell The Daily Beast that, at least in their conversations, he has not expressed sympathy for the ex-wives, Colbie Holderness and Jennifer Willoughby, who have gone on the record to allege physical violence.\u201c[It is] 100% not what's on his mind,\u201d one source close to Trump who has spoken with the president in recent days told The Daily Beast, referring to the well-being of alleged victims. The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment on this story.Trump has, however, made clear his displeasure with how his own staff has handled the Porter scandal, multiple sources tell The Daily Beast. Among those whom the president believes have done a less-than-adequate job include Communications Director Hope Hicks, who is dating Porter, and Chief of Staff John Kelly. According to a Friday report from ABC News, the latter told Trump he would resign over his handling of the Porter scandal if the president asked him to. The White House denies that Kelly \u201coffered\u201d his resignation. In particular, sources say, Trump has mused about how awful media coverage has been lately on Porter and the White House, and \u201chow terrible\u201d it appeared that the administration had\u2014in a jarringly uncharacteristic move from Trump-world\u2014copped to an error in its handling of the matter.For the president, it was a reversion to the mean: his knee-jerk impulse to defend those loyal to him crashing against the efforts by his team to manage the situation. Trump has dispensed with self-reflection and self-doubt before when it comes to standing by political allies and those close to him. Among those who he has defended against accusations of sexual harassment or assault include failed Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, the late Fox News architect Roger Ailes, and former heavyweight champ Mike Tyson. (The president himself has been accused by numerous women of sexual misconduct. The official position of the White House is that all the women are liars.)Even Trump\u2019s defenders find it tough to, well, defend. \u201cI\u2019m a supporter of the president but I\u2019m not a surrogate of the president here,\u201d said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump aide who has remained publicly supportive of the president, when asked of Trump\u2019s history of being persuaded by mens\u2019 denials. \u201cThat\u2019s his issue not mine.\u201dThose close to Trump say that he is monomaniacally committed to never admitting fault, which extends to those questioning the quality of his hires. In his comments on Friday, Trump heaped personal and professional praise upon Porter. \"We certainly wish him well. It's obviously a very tough time for him. He did a very good job while he was in the White House,\u201d the president gushed. \u201cWe hope that he will have a wonderful career.\u201dThe statement represented a staggering shift in White House strategy which had evolved from an initial, strident defense of Porter early this week, to disappointment but acceptance in his resignation, to disowning him entirely. On Thursday evening, the White House provided The Daily Beast a brief statement on the condition of anonymity, in which it stressed that officials felt \u201dmisled by Mr. Porter\u2019s characterization of the [then-]impending allegations from his ex-wives.\u201dIn failing to follow his own White House team\u2019s spin Trump was, aides and friends say, attempting to address his concerns that the scandal had, to that point, made him and his administration look bad. But instead of fixing matters, the president raised additional questions about his capacity to run the White House and the acumen of the team he has surrounded himself with. \u201cI think it is shocking that Hope Hicks still has a job,\u201d said Katie Packer Beeson, the deputy campaign manager for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign. \u201cAt the outset, she should have said, \u2018I'm conflicted.

U-S-A!\u201d\u2014is important for only one reason. In an otherwise unmemorable night, it is a window into how Trump\u2019s presidency is going to unfold in the coming months: with the slavish defense, indeed, devotion of his party. What was a hostile takeover of the GOP by an outsider is now a merger,\u00a0accepted by a group with a serious case of Stockholm Syndrome. Trump can insult the old GOP, threaten to primary them, libel and tweet-shame them and all that has gone to show that they need him more than he needs them. The normalization of Trump started with the tax bill. When Trump made GOP dreams of permanent tax cuts for the wealthy camouflaged by small and temporary ones for the middle class come true, it\u2019s hard to exaggerate the gratitude they felt. When Sen. Orrin Hatch called him perhaps the \u201cbest president\u201d ever in the Rose Garden celebration, he was reflecting the prevailing sentiment. That the individual mandate of Obamacare was destroyed in the process was icing on the cake. With that, they went from questioning his leadership ability and even his mental stability to a willingness to side with him in undermining the country\u2019s most sacred institutions if that what it takes to save him, and therefore, them. The newfound devotion is crucial given the rough times ahead. Nothing Trump tweets or does\u2014getting funding for a smart, or dumb, wall; becoming consoler-in-chief after a national tragedy as he hinted at a pre-SOTU lunch for TV anchors\u2014will divert attention from the Trump vs. Mueller drama that\u2019s coming to a theater near you. In one form or another Trump is going to have to appear before Mueller where honesty is the best policy under penalty of perjury. At least one son and one son-in-law are witnesses if not targets. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn is testifying reluctantly and former chief strategist Steve Bannon seems happy to sing like a bird if executive privilege doesn\u2019t interfere. Just a cursory look at Trump\u2019s own words and tweets shows obstruction of justice. This is where supine Republicans come in to undermine the investigation and investigators so as to subvert the rule of law. With Republicans falling in line if not in love, the party of Lincoln is teed up to defend him no matter what as they go about trashing the FBI and Justice Department they used to honor. The trash talk is also coming from key officials like Gen. John Kelly, the sainted chief of staff, who hasn\u2019t brought Trump up to his level but been reduced to that of Trump. Kelly has joined in the effort to find fault with\u2014and the time to directly pressure\u2014law enforcement officials connected to the Russian inquiry. It\u2019s not clear exactly how Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, married to a \u201closer,\u201d was railroaded into early retirement but Director Christopher Wray let it be known that McCabe left just ahead of an Inspector General\u2019s report critical of his handling of Hilary Clinton\u2019s emails. The latest moves to protect Trump is playing out with the full backing of Speaker Paul Ryan. He\u2019s in favor of the House intelligence committee chair, Rep. Devin Nunes, publishing classified material cherry-picked to supposedly show that the Justice Department improperly obtained a surveillance order for Carter Page, a former Trump campaign associate and a hapless mark of Russian operatives. And Ryan is fine with Nunes not releasing the full file which would show that this didn\u2019t happen. There was a time not so long-ago when Paul Ryan called out and demoted Nunes for his clownish nighttime caper to the White House to pick up and then re-deliver so-called secret documents heralded as giving credence to Trump\u2019s lunatic claim that former president Barack Obama wiretapped him. The documents did no such thing. But that demotion of Trump\u2019s water-carrier came before Ryan had a beloved tax cut for the GOP donor class in hand. Now Republicans see a soaring stock market, a booming economy, a becalmed international set at Davos, a complicit evangelical base, and think that the midterms might not be such a challenge if they can just stabilize the ship of state. Trump asks Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein if he\u2019s on his team and Republicans are undisturbed. Trump says on a hot mic that he\u2019s \u201c100% \u201c going to release the Nunes memo when the White House said hours earlier he hadn\u2019t even read it, and his party moves ahead with it at the risk of revealing sources and methods.Even as they stood and gustily cheered, what a tall order it must be to embrace Trump in what\u2019s being called a slow-motion Saturday Night Massacre. Even though Twitter Trump stayed home with a cheeseburger and Fox News while Teleprompter Trump came to Capitol Hill, they had to overlook a president willing to alter reality in the well of the House and never once smile. He strutted, mugged, and applauded for himself, chin jutting and eyes squinting, the most joyless president in modern history. Still I have a $50 hamburger at the Trump Hotel for anyone who spotted a Republican who didn\u2019t clap on cue. What they\u2019ve forgotten is that Trump is an anomaly who can be easily made unhappy but never made happy. Sell your soul to placate him today\u2014I\u2019m thinking of you, Gen. Kelly\u2014and tomorrow you may still find yourself cashiered. Just ask Attorney General Jeff Sessions how that works. Someday the Grand Old Party may see that by normalizing Trump they\u2019ve violated every traditional and constitutional norm. If that\u2019s the price of power, for now they are willing to pay it.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-gops-sad-stockholm-syndrome?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Marlow Stern", "body": "The Mooch is back. Why is anyone\u2019s guess.Fresh off a wacky, expletive-laden interview with Vanity Fair, former Trump White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who was canned after just eleven days on the job when he accused then-chief strategist Steve Bannon of autofellatio in a no-holds-barred interview with the New Yorker, made a Friday night stop on Real Time with Bill Maher. Things got off to a very rocky start\u2014an expected outcome, given how Mooch was flanked by Maher, anti-Trump conservative David Frum, and ex-interim DNC chairperson Donna Brazile, and that the Mooch\u2019s political career has been defined by crass opportunism, with the former Hillary and Obama backer supporting first Scott Walker, then reaching out to Marco Rubio, and then endorsing Jeb Bush before finally joining the Trump campaign in 2016 (despite branding Trump \u201canti-American\u201d and a \u201chack politician\u201d just one year prior).\u00a0 Early on, Scaramucci defended the Trump tax cuts, leaving Maher beside himself. \u201cAnthony, where is most of the money going? Where\u2019s most of the money going?!\u201d the host pleaded, prompting Scaramucci to launch into a red herring-tale of the decline of the working class due to globalization.

Bush speechwriter. \u201cI have a question for you: before you went into government, where you served as communications advisor, you were given an enormous offer from a Chinese group for the purchase of your company for what, $90 million, before you went in. After you came out, the purchasers lost interest. How am I to understand that?\u201d he queried. Frum was referring to a conflict of interest that arose when Mooch took the White House gig: the pending sale of his investment firm Skybridge Capital, valued at between $200-230 million, to the shady Chinese firm HNA Capital, which has deep ties to the Chinese government. Mooch was himself expected to clear $77 million from the deal after taxes, though it never passed regulators. If you recall during the campaign, Mooch, in a hilarious self-own, called on the FBI and Justice Department to investigate the \u201cleak\u201d of his financial disclosure forms revealing his existing ties to Skybridge, despite them being a matter of public record. He later blamed the \u201cleak\u201d\u2014even though there was no leak, as the documents were given to an inquiring reporter by the Export-Import Bank\u2014on then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, causing a rift between Mooch and pals Priebus and Bannon. The Mooch, seething with anger, called Frum\u2019s accusation \u201ccompletely untrue and \u201cBS,\u201d telling him to \u201ccall the Treasury Department.\u201d Pursing his lips and flexing, The Mooch exuded an air of agitated calm throughout the HBO show\u2019s panel discussion, finding himself repeatedly on the receiving end of barbs courtesy of Frum, Brazile, and occasionally Maher. When Maher suggested that \u201cRussia helped\u201d Trump win the election, Scaramucci replied, \u201cYou\u2019re suggesting that [Trump] colluded with the Russians,\u201d which, no, that was not the suggestion. Mooch later admitted that he agrees with the assessment of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), which oversees all 17 U.S. federal intelligence agencies, that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election\u2014though appeared to ignore the part of the report stating: \u201cWe assess the [Russian] influence campaign aspired to help President-elect Trump\u2019s chances of victory when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to the President-elect.\u201d But it was Frum who clashed loudest and longest with Scaramucci, with the #NeverTrumper at one point charging that he was blinded by \u201cambition,\u201d which, true, and later saying, \u201cI\u2019ve spent more time in a Republican administration than you. As a Republican, does it not stick in your craw that Vladimir Putin wanted to help your guy so much? Don\u2019t you ask yourself the question, \u2018Why did my guy win the Putin primary?\u2019\u201dMooch brushed the question off, replying, \u201cYour level of anger and sanctimony is not coming across as great on television.\u201d Thank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

One or the other,\u201d referring to the beginning of Mooch\u2019s guest appearance where he indeed name-dropped Harvard several times. (The Mooch is also worth several hundred millions dollars.) It was Maher, of course, who got the last laugh. When pressed by the comedian as to how he\u2019d explain Trump\u2019s Access Hollywood tape to his child someday, Mooch unconvincingly replied, \u201cDepending on his age, I\u2019ll be very honest with \u2018em.

For years, he has been the NRA\u2019s main man lobbying in Russia, with an outpost for his activities in Washington as well.\nOne of the guests at the Bunker 42 party, well-known political analyst Georgy Bovt, noticed that no other Russian officials were present, and, for what it\u2019s worth, he didn\u2019t get the impression the Americans were the kind of people who could establish a bridge between the political elites of the United States and Russia.\nTo somebody like Bovt, who has worked as a editor in chief for several magazines since the 1990s and seen the kind of shows the Kremlin will put on at a dinner, the spread looked pretty modest: just a few sandwiches and drinks. \n\u201cI could not see any sign of the Kremlin\u2019s hand behind that event,\u201d Bovt told The Daily Beast. \u201cThere were a few Americans who looked like ordinary pensioners discussing gun rights in the U.S. with members of a Russian shooting association, which, by the way, was closed down about a month ago.\u201d\nIn January, the McClatchy news service reported that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking closely at Torshin, who is also a former senator from President Vladimir Putin\u2019s United Russia party, amid allegations he may have funneled money into Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign through the NRA.\nThat story has come back into the news now in the aftermath of the Valentine\u2019s Day slaughter at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, as heartbroken, angry survivors have focused attention on the gun lobby\u2019s \u201cpuppet\u201d politicians, who block common-sense efforts to limit the raw firepower available over the counter. Add Moscow to that mix, and the atmosphere of conspiracy grows very dark indeed.\nBut was the Russia-Torshin-NRA connection a factor in the Trump election?\nU.S. intelligence agencies and at least one top White House official, national security adviser H.R. McMaster, say they have no doubt that Putin sought to influence the American elections and undermine their credibility, that the evidence is \u201cincontrovertible.\u201d \nEven Trump now concedes that point, while denying vehemently that his campaign colluded with the Russian operation or that they tipped the scales in his favor. Indeed, he insists, improbably, that others somehow benefited more from the Russian operation than he did.\nIn point of fact, Trump lost the popular vote by about 3 million ballots but won in the decisive Electoral College tally because of a total margin of roughly 100,000 votes\u2014or less\u2014in three swing states: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

These ranged from \u201cimpairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of the Federal Election Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the U.S. Department of State\u201d to mail fraud and identity theft. \nThe 37-page indictment (PDF) says senior employees of the Internet Research Agency visited the U.S. under false pretenses in 2014 to gather intelligence on the upcoming elections, visiting several states, including Michigan, that might prove critical to the outcome. The IRA also subsequently was told by \u201cunwitting\u201d Trump activists to focus on \u201cpurple states\u201d that were in play. \n\n\u201cExperts on the disorganization of the Kremlin insist that the Torshin story is much more nuanced and perhaps less menacing than it appears in Washington, because the Kremlin\u2019s right wing often has no idea what the left wing is doing.\u201d\n\nIn Russia, where Putin\u2019s political opponents have quite enough of their own problems, it has become commonplace among independent analysts as well as Kremlin supporters to dismiss the whole \u201cRussia conspiracy\u201d as a paranoid American fantasy. And experts on the disorganization of the Kremlin insist that the Torshin story is much more nuanced and perhaps less menacing than it appears in Washington, because the Kremlin\u2019s right wing often has no idea what the left wing is doing.\nAs The New Yorker\u2019s Masha Gessen wrote after the Mueller indictments, \u201cLoyal Putinites and dissident intellectuals alike are remarkably united in finding the American obsession with Russian meddling to be ridiculous.\u201d\nHence Bovt\u2019s judgment about the crummy canap\u00e9s in Stalin\u2019s bunker.\nThat said, there is no question that NRA funds\u2014more than $30 million\u2014were a significant factor in support of Trump\u2019s candidacy, and even a small donation forming part of that would raise legal issues. It is unlawful to use foreign money to influence federal elections. \nIf Torshin did give money to the NRA, tracing that through to legally actionable support for the Trump campaign could be extremely difficult. But Torshin\u2019s profile makes him seem a very colorful villain. Spanish investigators allege the Russian banker is a mafia godfather laundering money for Moscow\u2019s infamous Taganskaya organized crime group through Spanish banks and real estate deals. \nIndeed, the Spanish newspaper of record, El Pa\u00eds, ran a lengthy report about Torshin almost a year ago.\nAccording to that article, phone taps indicated that Torshin outranked a local capo named Alexander Romanov (who has since been convicted on organized crime related charges). Romanov referred to Torshin as \u201cthe Godfather\u201d and \u201cthe boss.\u201d \nTorshin has denied the Spanish allegations, and, mocking the renewed accusations this week, he retweeted a picture of Al Pacino in The Godfather next to a quotation: \u201cThe rule for the reasonable ones is to go against the rules, when there is no other way to finish what you started.\u201d (Torshin, by the way, often tweets in English.) \nAccording to the police documents cited by the Spanish press, Torshin was supposed to go to the mobster Romanov\u2019s birthday party in Palma in 2013, and Spanish authorities were waiting to arrest him. But Torshin didn\u2019t turn up. \u201cA unit consisting of 12 officers was awaiting him at the airport and in a hotel, where he was expected to arrive accompanied by other people being investigated in a money-laundering ring,\u201d but they were left empty-handed.\nThe Spanish believe Torshin was tipped off.\nThen, in February of last year, it appears it was the new Trump administration that was tipped off about Torshin\u2019s shady connections. \nThrough his NRA ties, Torshin was invited to a prayer breakfast with the newly inaugurated President Donald Trump on Feb. 1 and was supposed to have a personal encounter before that started. \nBut according to the El Pa\u00eds article and a report by Michael Isikoff on Yahoo! News, who also collaborated on the El Pa\u00eds story, Torshin\u2019s invitation was canceled at the last minute because a senior White House staffer spotted his name on the guest list and said he had \u201cbaggage,\u201d meaning an alleged criminal background.\nWhatever Torshin\u2019s links to the Russian mob, he certainly makes no secret of his ties to the NRA. \nRussians have an interest in the organization, not least, because of the extensive sale of AK-47 assault rifles in the American market. Indeed, after the gun\u2019s inventor, Mikhail Kalashnikov, died in December 2013 at 94, Torshin published an obituary in The Washington Times. \nIn the last paragraph, Torshin mentioned that he \u201chad the pleasure of attending the National Rifle Association\u2019s annual meeting in Houston\u201d in 2013, noting that he and Kalashnikov had \u201cboth been \u2018life members\u2019 of the NRA for years.\u201d\nIn May 2016, Torshin confirmed to Russian reporters that he had been seated at the same table as Donald Trump Jr. at a private dinner during the NRA convention that same month in Louisville, Kentucky. \nBut in Moscow, the skepticism remains. \n\u201cI have known Torshin for a long time and I can say that he has never passed, never transferred any money to Trump\u2019s campaign. This is just a ridiculous thought,\u201d Yuri Krupnov, a pro-Kremlin political analyst, told The Daily Beast.\nIndeed, Torshin\u2019s critics in Russia regarded his meetings in the U.S. as a sign that he could not be trusted\u2014in Russia. In 2015 the professor and corruption fighter Alexander Fridom published articles about Torshin\u2019s cooperation with the NRA, \u201can organization that supported anti-Russian projects,\u201d calling for Russian authorities to investigate Torshin.\n\n\u201cMany believed that Torshin, a lifelong member of the NRA, was paid by American firearms producers, acting as their lobbyist.\u201d\n\u2014 Sergei Markov, member of parliament\n\nAt the time Torshin held a sensitive post as a member of the National Antiterrorist Committee.\n\u201cRussian modern history knows only two high-ranking officials having both full access to secret information in Russia and a political lobbying role abroad: former secretary of Security Council Boris Berezovsky and Senator Torshin,\u201d Fridom wrote.\nThe majority of Russians, more than 70 percent, do not support Torshin\u2019s idea of legalizing guns. They say there is more than enough violence on the streets\u2014police reports counted more than 9,000 murders in 2017. \n\u201cIf we legalize weapons, police would have to deal with people shooting each other to death on the buses and trains,\u201d Sergei Markov, a member of parliament, told The Daily Beast. The recent school shootings in the U.S. have inspired the Russian parliament to discuss a new bill that would oblige every owner of firearms to wear identification tags similar to the symbols on the uniforms of law enforcement officials.\nBanker Torshin would have to wear one, too. \nIn a rare interview on the television channel Moscow24, Torshin confessed: \u201cTo me, one kind of love is for firearms.\u201d \nTorshin also noted that he had grown up in a tiny village in Kamchatka. On a visit there in in 2008, he found only ruins and ashes where his house had once stood, an experience he seems to link to the need to defend hearth and home. \u201cYou are not afraid of anything after you see something like this.\u201d\nTorshin started collecting weapons 30 years ago, he said. \u201cSomething like a revolver, that you can hide in your vest, would be of interest for me,\u201d Torshin told Russian viewers, showing where on his body he would hide such a weapon. The official was convinced that he, as well as every Russian man, should have a chance to defend his house, his vehicle, and his church parish from \u201cyoung thugs.\u201d\nThree years ago, as a result of pressure from his critics\u2014who blamed Torshin for being \u201can American agent\u201d\u2014the senator lost his vice-speaker position in the upper house of the Russian parliament, the Federation Council. \n\u201cTorshin was pushing for the legalization of weapons. That idea was never popular among our law enforcement agencies,\u201d said Markov. \u201cMany believed that Torshin, a lifelong member of the NRA, was paid by American firearms producers, acting as their lobbyist.\u201d", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/whats-the-truth-about-the-nras-man-in-moscow?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Naveed Jamali", "body": "Introduction:\nMy relationship with the FBI and Russian intelligence began in 1988 when a Soviet Intelligence officer walked into my parents\u2019 office in midtown Manhattan. The man wanted to buy some books\u2014something that was in line with what my family\u2019s company did: \u00a0supplying the government with books. After the man left, two men walked into the family office and said, \u201cThat man was a Soviet intelligence officer... get him his books.\u201d \nIn 2005, with 9/11 fresh on my mind and the desire to join the Navy as an intelligence officer, I offered to help the FBI against the Russians who had been coming to the family office for almost two decades. In the years I worked as what the Russians believed was their spy, I saw how the Russians target and recruit Americans. It is these actions that I saw as an FBI double agent posing as a Russian spy that I believe were used in 2016. \nExcerpt from How to Catch a Russian Spy: new epilogue for paperback edition:\nI tried to warn you. Though the Cold War is supposedly over, the Russians still view America as enemy number one. They thirst for the return of Soviet glory. They\u2019re eager to expand their diminished sphere of influence. They\u2019ll stop at nothing to undermine the world\u2019s democracies\u2014 invading their neighbors, aligning with despots and terrorists, employing their espionage agents and computer skills to threaten any nation they view as an adversary.\nWho could possibly be surprised that the Russians would try to influence the outcome of an American presidential election? I know I wasn\u2019t. Before they came for Donald Trump and those around him, they came for me.\nNo longer are the Russians motivated by communist ideology. Power, money, and domination\u2014that\u2019s what they thirst for now. Their ruthlessness and craftiness haven\u2019t diminished one iota. They\u2019ve grown bolder. Not satisfied with trying to corrupt young Americans like me, they\u2019ve set their sights higher, aiming to exert influence in the Oval Office itself.\nI have no idea whether, in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Russians found those around Donald Trump\u2014or Trump himself\u2014easy marks, or whether in their subtle recruiting they received more than they bargained for, as they did when they tried to turn me. As I role-played with senior Russian military-intelligence officer Oleg Kulikov, my FBI handlers and I managed to outfox him and his superiors in Moscow. We wasted their resources. We buried them in disinformation. And as you\u2019ve read in prior pages, we unmasked Oleg, proving that this high-ranking United Nations diplomat was, in fact, a busy Russian spy.\nSomething tells me the Russians were more on their game this time around, but as I write this, it\u2019s still too early to know.\nNow, the whole world is focused on Russian espionage activities in the United States. Congressional committees are investigating. A special counsel is digging in. News pundits delight in conducting damage assessments. The political implications are enormous, extending to the highest levels. Our national security is at stake. And I find myself in a unique position, two years after How to Catch a Russian Spy was first released in hardcover. The story I told is suddenly at the center of everything. I lived it on the inside as few American civilians have. Everything I saw, everything I learned, everything I warned about is startlingly relevant. I have looked into the eyes of our Russian enemies. I know what they\u2019re capable of. To fully understand what\u2019s happening now, you have to recall\u2014and fully understand\u2014what happened to me.\nDuring the time I acted as a double agent\u2014a period that stretched from 2005 to my last meeting with Kulikov in late 2008\u2014the Cold War had long been over and the Russian threat had faded from the public eye. In a post\u20139/11 world, the FBI was focused on counter-terrorism, not so much counter-espionage. While the agents I worked with were dedicated professionals, they no longer had Russians on their minds in the same way their colleagues had in 1988, on the first day a Soviet intelligence officer walked into my parents\u2019 office in New York City. The Russians, on the other hand, always behaved as if their time in New York City was spent behind enemy lines. Consequently, Oleg Kulikov took great precautions to ensure he wasn\u2019t being observed. Exhibit A was his adamant refusal to use electronic communications like email or cell phones, which would have exposed him to FBI surveillance.\n\n\u201cHad the FBI been committed to playing the counter-espionage long game in 2008, might they have racked up subsequent wins against the Russians that would have changed the 2016 election?\u201d\n\nIndeed, during my time jousting with Oleg, Russian paranoia and a well-cloaked distaste for Americans influenced not just how Russian intelligence operators spied but also how they lived their daily lives. For instance, though they often took full advantage of the free American services offered to them, like public school educations for their kids, they refused to pay for tolls, viewing the activity as contributing to the U.S. government. My interaction with Oleg showed how comfortable the Russians were while operating in \u201cenemy territory.\u201d Take, for example, his telling me how to handle cash to avoid bank reporting or how he filled me in on the amount of access to information I\u2019d have once I joined the military. That these far-from-home Russians were in their comfort zone was no surprise; they\u2019d been running the same game for decades.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nI shouldn\u2019t have been surprised that the Russians were ruthlessly patient\u2014that they were completely willing to spend years studying and testing me before actually tasking me with retrieving information.\nOne of the most important lessons I learned during my operational time is how, in a world reliant on network and cyber security and focused on keeping outsiders out, it is relatively easy to recruit someone on the inside. The most effective firewalls and tallest guard towers are totally useless if a Russian operative can simply co-opt a person who has legitimate access to a facility. My ability to get access to Northrop Grumman or the U.S. government\u2019s Defense Technology Information Center (DTIC) database proves how effective the Russians\u2019 \u201cfind the insider\u201d approach can be. My actions were never even questioned by on-site personnel.\nThe truth is, so many of our security efforts are devoted to keeping the bad guys out that looking at those already inside becomes an afterthought. Or, as I liked to say to the FBI, \u201cLegitimacy is just a smile and an official business card away.\u201d\nThe Russian method, as I observed with Oleg, has always been to target potential spies, meet with them, and evaluate their suitability. The process can be excruciatingly slow\u2014even meandering. I would sit up at night wondering what plan the Russians had in store for me. I wondered, What is their master plan? Of course, retrospectively, I can see that I was putting the cart before the horse. First, the Russians wanted to determine if I could be used. They\u2019d save the how for later.\nIt\u2019s easy to wonder if, in the months leading up to the 2016 presidential election, the Russians were engaged in purposeful meandering aimed at determining the could. I\u2019d be willing to bet that they were. But I\u2019d also be willing to bet that the Russians succeeded in direct proportion to the extent that the FBI downplayed Russia\u2019s active-measures capability. My story serves as a reminder that American counterintelligence has slowly atrophied while precious resources and attention have been shifted to counterterrorism. At the height of my success infiltrating the Russian spy network, the FBI\u2019s unwillingness to take on more risk caused them to shut down the operation.\nIt was a decision that I\u2019ve always found to be both short-sighted and indicative of a larger issue. It seemed that those who ran the FBI were interested in short-term wins\u2014exactly the opposite of the Russian approach. The Russians were\u2014and are\u2014willing to play the long game and take risks. How can the FBI defend against that if they\u2019re not willing to roll the dice with an established operation like mine?\nI was willing to go in deeper. Scratch that. I was eager to. It was my FBI handlers or their superiors who decided to pull the plug. Had the FBI been committed to playing the counter-espionage long game in 2008, might they have racked up subsequent wins against the Russians that would have changed the 2016 election? That\u2019s a tormenting question that\u2019s hard to answer, and it keeps me up at night. The 2016 election was an awfully close one. The Russians clearly attempted to influence the results. Even a few switched votes could have changed everything. Who knows? By now, we could all be getting used to a second President Clinton, and Donald Trump could be recruiting contestants for a brand-new season of The Apprentice.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/i-was-a-double-agent-for-russia-and-theyre-at-it-again?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Sam Stein", "body": "Immediately following the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the National Rifle Association did what it always does: It shut up. \nThe biggest gun rights group in the nation didn\u2019t put out a statement on the shooting, which claimed the lives of 17 students. Its Twitter stayed dormant for five days. The group\u2019s Facebook page stayed quiet for four days, posting a lone missive on Monday, alerting followers to a billboard in Kentucky that read: \u201cKill The NRA.\u201d  \nBut outside of that, there was zilch. It was a case study in the public relations strategy known as \u201criding out the storm.\u201d \nBut not everyone under the NRA umbrella stayed silent. In the hours after Parkland, NRA TV, the television channel run by the gun rights lobby, continued producing content. At first, its anchors struck a conciliatory tone, noting that they shared the objective of making schools a safe place for children. Then they began pushing the company line: that school resource officers needed to be tactically trained and armed to prevent such shootings from being more gruesome. \nThen, it turned aggressive. \nOver the past two days, NRA TV has gone after both law enforcement for bungling the shooting and media outlets for calling for more expansive gun laws. Host Dan Bongino accused the New York Daily News of being both \u201cpure filth\u201d and \u201cnot worthy of collecting dog excrement\u201d\u2014aka actual filth. Host Dana Loesch called for protesters to march \u201cto the FBI offices\u201d for its failure to act on the numerous reports it received that the shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was dangerous and potentially unstable. Grant Stinchfield, another NRA TV host, added his thoughts on the fourth estate on Monday, suggesting reporters were eager for another shooting to push a gun control agenda. \nThere is a largely\u2014though not universally\u2014agreed upon theory within political circles that one of the reasons gun legislation is so difficult to get passed is because of the power of the gun rights lobby. The NRA has cultivated its image as the top dog on the Hill, able to whip up the frenzied support of its millions of members at even the slightest hint at a gun control measure may pass. \nBut the way in which the group is wielding its influence is changing. For decades, the gun rights group\u2019s political potency stemmed from its laser focus on a single issue that often transcends other partisan divides. Elected officials as far left as Bernie Sanders have maintained more mainstream positions on gun rights in the past precisely because the issue has historically appealed even to large numbers of Democrats in certain parts of the country. \nOver the last couple years though, the NRA has developed a far more robust social media presence, glossy advertising and branding efforts, and a bigger footprint in electoral politics. NRA TV is the epicenter of this new form of advocacy\u2014one in which right-wing politics and cultural signifiers are nearly as prominent as the Second Amendment itself. \nThe proof is in the billing. The show Frontlines, hosted by Oliver North and Chuck Holton, pledges to cover military and law enforcement matters, including \u201cradiological sabotage, counterfeiting and terrorism, to the threat of an unstable economy and cyber warfare.\u201d Bill Whittle\u2019s Hot Mic is pitched as a critique of the \u201cleft-wing pop culture's war on our freedom and rights.\u201d The show \u201cI Am Forever,\u201d which is no longer active, had a tagline that read: \u201cAmerican culture is at a crisis point.\u201d\nNRA TV\u2019s most prominent public voices have amplified this broader focus with commentary that conspicuously avoids mention of gun rights and, instead, toes a line more typical of an explicitly pro-Trump political organization. Hosts have been hyper-critical of NFL players for taking a knee in protest of racial disparities in the criminal justice system. They have hyped fears about undocumented immigrants and opined favorably about the president\u2019s so-called Muslim-ban. One host labelled the Black Lives Matter movement \u201ca weaponized race-baiting machine.\u201d\nTheir primary enemy, however, has been the media. Loesch, who signed on as a spokesperson for the group last year, has drawn headlines for a series of scathing videos attacking Trump\u2019s critics in the press, and has singled out a number of specific outlets for criticism.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nAsked about those videos and their focus on issues separate from gun rights, and in particular an NRA-alleged attempt by the political left to undermine Trump\u2019s 2016 election victory, Loesch defended the organization\u2019s broader political focus. \u201cMembers have many concerns, the attack on our republic\u2019s electoral process among them,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.\nThe multi-pronged, highly-aggressive approach to advocacy has made the NRA a more overtly political organization (though its polling numbers have remained somewhat stable). It\u2019s also made it more complicated to combat for gun control groups which are used to waging battles in the halls of Congress or in lower-profile town hall settings. \n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that they\u2019re ahead of the curve now,\u201d said Jim Kessler, a senior vice president for policy and a co-founder of Third Way and a longtime gun control activist. \u201cYou look at their leadership and it is a bunch of pudgy, pasty aging white guys. And they get overpaid. They are probably not working too hard. And you\u2019re thinking, this seems like some tired old industry\u2026 But underneath, there is a lot of shrewdness and dynamism. And they have so much money that they can experiment.\u201d \nRequests for comment made to the NRA were not returned. But critics of the organization also insist that they have branched out as an organization not just as a strategic imperative but out of financial necessity. The shift in the group\u2019s focus mirrors changes in U.S. gun ownership overall. Though the number of privately owned firearms in the U.S. is at an all-time high, those guns are owned by a diminishing percentage of households. \nThe NRA has countered that trend, experts say, by becoming more than just a gun group. The organization has put its brand on everything from sportswear to jewelry to safes, cigars, books and DVDs. For $134.95, one can buy an \u201cNRA Critical Food Supply\u201d bucket that would provide 56 dishes in lieu of a temporary power outage or a \u201ccatastrophic grid collapse.\u201d It has numerous publications, including the magazine America\u2019s 1st Freedom, and a prominent podcast. It also has a wine club, where first time members can get four \u201cexceptional\u201d bottles for under $30. And, this summer, you can join the group on a Freedom Cruise to Normandy, which Oliver North will host. \nIn the spring of 2017, it began selling a multi-pronged insurance policy, underwritten by the Chubb subsidiary Westchester, to provide legal protection to gun owners should they shoot someone out of self-defense or personal protection. The NRA called its product Carry Guard. Critics dubbed it \u201cmurder insurance.\u201d \n\u201cAt the end of the day we both either have to pass or stop laws,\u201d said Shannon Watts, founder of the gun control group Moms Demand Action. \u201cWhat they are creating is a marketing empire because what they are trying to do is sell guns and that requires marketing.\u201d \nThose who have followed the NRA, and fought it, say that its current incarnation is simply an extension of roads taken decades earlier. There was the \u201cRevolt at Cincinnati\u201d in 1977, when activists within the group voted out leadership after it had chosen to move its headquarters to Colorado in what was seen as a retreat from politics. There was Harlon Carter\u2019s transformation of the NRA into a fiercely political institution. There was the fundraising email that labeled federal agents \u201cjack-booted thugs,\u201d which prompted George H.W. Bush\u2019s resignation as a lifelong NRA member. And there was the infamous response to the shooting at Sandy Hook elementary in 2012, when executive vice president Wayne LaPierre declared that the only thing that could stop a bad guy with a gun was \u201ca good guy with a gun.\u201d \nAn organization that began as a stodgy gun club has increasingly become an avatar for a certain political lifestyle and ideological bend. \n\u201cThey have always been a little bit ahead of the Republican Party in moving away from button up business conservatism to white working class nationalism,\u201d said Cliff Schecter, a co-host of the UnPresidented podcast, a longtime gun control advocate, and a Daily Beast columnist. \u201dIn many ways, they were Trump before Trump.\u201d", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/nra-usually-shuts-up-after-mass-shootings-not-this-time?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "James Poulos", "body": "Here\u2019s a glaring sign of the turbulence of our political times: No sooner has the Tea Party been pronounced dead than we\u2019re hearing of liberal or progressive Tea Parties on the rise. Fearing his primary challenger is setting a trend, Rep. Dan Lipinski, (D-IL), now warns of a \u201ctea party of the left.\u201d At least one movement analyst proclaims the arrival of a new \u201ctea party of the pragmatic center-left.\u201d \nDemocrats may take inspiration from the idea that the conservative Tea Party died a particularly ideological death, obsolesced by a pendulum swing in popular opinion toward Trumpian deficit spending on the right and social justice on the left. But if the relatively sudden extinction of the Don\u2019t-Tread-On-Me brigades has a deeper, more serious root, political faith in a follow-on grassroots lurch leftward may be misplaced. \nAnd, as it turns out, there\u2019s reason to believe that the Tea Party fizzled out because it fell victim to the same inexorable force that\u2019s plowing under so many institutions large and small: the internet. \nOr, to be more precise, the logic and structure of online discourse. The biggest difference between Republican politics during the Tea Party era and Republican politics today isn\u2019t ideological\u2014although, to be sure, the difference is serious. Even more important is the vast conceptual and practical gulf that separates the very offline Tea Party routine of town halls and meetups from the very online movement that\u2014with slight exaggeration\u2014memed Donald Trump into the White House. \nYes, there were serious post-election efforts to take the Trump movement from social media to the town square. But these plans went terribly, predictably awry, hurting the movement and going viral only in the way of an epic self-own. And as for the mid-election rallies Trump himself loved so much, they took their cues more from the so-called fever swamps of online than they did from the old-fashioned constitutionalist cosplay of the citizen activists who defined the Tea Party. \nStill, Democrats have largely convinced themselves that the Tea Party, like the Trump movement, was just a handy vehicle for channeling and organizing simple bigotry. Whether in a Washington wig or a Pepe mask, hate is hate, they might say. The recent Republican retreat from deficit hawkery seemed to ram that point home: When a black president busts the budget, he\u2019s imperiling the Republic, but when an orange president does it, #MAGA!\nThis account, whatever its lures, misses out on some of what distinguishes a more technological and communications-driven approach. From that standpoint, the key to the Tea Party is that\u2014from Day One, during Rick Santelli\u2019s infamous rant\u2014the movement was thoroughly TV-driven. Although it attracted some online involvement from people who\u2019d go on to fuel the Trump-era digital right wing, the Tea Party didn\u2019t spread like a meme or frustrate counterattack like trolls do because it wasn\u2019t a digital beast. It played by pre-digital rules for pre-digital ends, like better citizenship, better representatives, and better policymaking. \nThen the internet took over on the right. It unearthed and organized a new generation\u2014one that didn\u2019t want to use established means to right the wrongs of a systemic crisis. For the new online right, the goal was nearly the opposite: to infect the system and heighten the crisis, forcing the system to replicate behavior the system didn\u2019t want to. \nAnd, to the shock of TV people everywhere, it worked. But the TV-culture view of the digital right is still dangerously wrong. True, the new online right of the Trump era doesn\u2019t care about balanced budgets. True, that\u2019s because it rejects the politics of \u201cresponsibility\u201d altogether. But why? Because if you\u2019re on the right and you\u2019re immersed in digital life, the way you approach politics as a whole has been, let\u2019s say, \u201cdigitized.\u201d \nOnline life doesn\u2019t habituate us to transparency and responsibility in financial matters. What it does counsel is that everything continuously expands and can\u2019t be corralled. It teaches that no one entity can encompass the whole. So why would the budget be any different? Online, violating expectations for laughs is almost a foundational principle. So why not an about-face on spending? If it goes viral, go with it. Chances are, you\u2019ll have the momentum and the command of attention it takes to prevail in the aftermath. \nFor Democrats and Republicans alike, it\u2019s worth carefully considering that the Tea Party is toast because the new right is digitally native, inspired, and organized by a definitive extent to the thought patterns of online life. Because if that experience can rip apart and reconfigure one major party, there\u2019s no reason it can\u2019t do the same to the other. Instead of a mirror-image Tea Party anywhere on the left of center, prognosticators should watch for the rise of an outsize new political force ready to triumph through its mastery of digital life.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-internet-conquered-the-right-killed-the-tea-party-and-elected-donald-trump-5?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Marlow Stern", "body": "During a rally on Monday, President Trump called the Democrats \u201ctreasonous\u201d for not applauding during his terribly boring, terribly grim State of the Union address. \u201cThey were like death and un-American.

Skripal was found collapsed on a bench with the woman in the riverfront shopping district in the cathedral city of Salisbury.\nWiltshire police say they have not yet confirmed that a crime has taken place but their response to the discovery of the potential victims suggests they are taking that possibility seriously. Officers sealed off the area and later shut down the emergency room at the hospital for fear that the suspected substance could affect other people.\nSkripal was a Russian army colonel who worked for the army inteligence unit known as the GRU. He was arrested in 2006 for passing information to the British about Russian spies dating back to the 1990s. The FSB, the notorious successor to the KGB, claimed that Skripal was recruited by the British in the mid-1990s and was paid up to $100,000 into a bank account in Spain for a decade\u2019s worth of spying.\nHe retired from the GRU in 1999 before joining the Russian Foreign Ministry until 2003. In a trial three years later, the Russians say they discovered that he had been shopping information on \u00a0Russian spies stationed all over Europe.\nHe was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2006, but he was released early and allowed to retire in Britain\u2019s picturesque South-West as part of a major spy swap. At the time of his release, his lawyer said Skripal was concerned about his health as he was suffering from diabetes.\nUntil the British authorities have obtained toxicology reports it will remain unclear whether Skripal\u2019s collapse raises suspicions about Russian influence.\nIn previous examples of suspected Russian assassinations in Britain, the poison has not been detected until long after the victims had sought medical assistance.\nFormer FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko died in agony in a North London hospital after polonium-210 was slipped into a pot of tea at a Mayfair hotel by two Russian agents Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun.\nIt was weeks before the authorities identified the highly unusual radioactive poison and many more years until an official inquiry formally found that Litvinenko had \u201cprobably\u201d been murdered on the orders of the Kremlin.\nThe case of Alexander Perepilichnyy, a Russian whistleblower who collapsed while running near his home in the suburbs outside London, was even more embarrassing for the British authorities.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

It was a scandal that would rock American politics and law enforcement to its core and, at a minimum, raise serious questions about the integrity of the investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election. The memo was released on Friday afternoon. And the White House\u2019s reaction to its release has been conspicuously muted. Late into Friday afternoon, President Donald Trump had not publicly discussed or tweeted about the memo since fielding questions about 45 minutes prior to its release. The White House did put out a formal statement on the memo. But it was done under the name of the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. \u00a0The most prominent social media presences in the administration put nothing about the memo on Twitter. White House officials were entirely absent from the airwaves to discuss it. Allies to the administration and friendly Capitol Hill Republicans received little to no guidance from the president\u2019s team about what their spin on the memo should be. A senior aide to a House Republican close to Trump told The Daily Beast that the White House had issued no messaging instructions whatsoever. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten none,\u201d the aide said. \u201cIt\u2019s been oddly quiet actually.\u201d Another source, a prominent White House surrogate, reported \u201csilence\u201d in the lead-up to the memo\u2019s release early Friday afternoon.For an administration that was generally expected to exploit the memo in an effort to insulate the president from an ongoing Justice Department investigation, the fact that said exploitation didn\u2019t actually take place was viewed curiously. One interpretation was that the White House was intent on letting the memo speak for itself, convinced that the damage would be clear and indisputable. Another was that it reflected an administration whose press shop is capable of ginning up a controversy but not well versed in managing the fallout. The memo, authored by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, alleges that the FBI sought a surveillance warrant against former Trump campaign aide Carter Page using a dossier compiled by a former British spy at the behest of an opposition researcher on retainer for the Democratic Party. House Democrats have vehemently disputed the memo\u2019s conclusions. But within hours of its release, conservative groups were laying the groundwork to use the memo to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into alleged Russian election-meddling on behalf of the Trump campaign in 2016.Trump reportedly hopes that the memo will give him the pretext to rein in Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, whose acquiescence Trump would need to officially sack Mueller. But in the wake of the memo\u2019s release, even the White House\u2019s official response was relatively muted.In public remarks prior to the memo\u2019s release, the president called the memo\u2019s allegations \u201ca disgrace.\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Sanders released a statement saying that the memo \u201craises serious concerns about the integrity of decisions made at the highest levels of the Department of Justice and the FBI to use the Government\u2019s most intrusive surveillance tools against American citizens.\u201d But that was the extent of White House communications about the memo. Staff remained publicly silent about it throughout the afternoon, instead focusing on other major White House issues such as positive economic indicators, immigration reform proposals, and recently codified tax cuts.Thank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Taking to Twitter, Donald Trump Jr. laid out the case that the memo would spark a fundamental overhaul of the top tiers of the entire Justice Department.

I had just told the Russian intelligence officer that I had been accepted into the United States Navy\u2019s Reserve Intelligence program, and would soon be an intelligence officer. \nMonths before that, I had handed Oleg copies of various paperwork about both the program and my application but now he wanted more \u2014he wanted to bring back more solid evidence for his superiors documenting the importance of the man he had recruited to spy for Russia. It was one of our many conversations that relied on face-to-face meetings, that allowed me to fool the veteran Russian spy into believing that he was recruiting me, while in fact I was an FBI operational asset.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Russia is actively involved in collecting intelligence on the United States and running operations to undermine America. It is a craft Russia has honed and carried out since the fledgling days of the Cold War, and one that Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s indictment of 13 Russians, with more reportedly coming, re-enforces is still very much active. \nWhile Mueller\u2019s indictment doesn\u2019t mention the Russian government, it presents methods\u2014such as sending covert agents to operate clandestinely in the United States\u2014that are hallmarks of their intelligence services. Russian intelligence officers arrive in the United States, often posing as diplomats, in what is known as \u201cnon-official cover.\u201d \u00a0As Meuller\u2019s indictment puts it, they come \u201cfor the purpose of collecting intelligence to inform Defendants' operations.\u201d \nFrom my own experience working as a double-agent against Russian intelligence from 2005 to 2009, I know that they collect that intelligence by targeting and recruiting Americans to serve as operational assets. \u00a0\nIn the digital age, a common question is why the need to recruit spies? Couldn\u2019t spy services simply collect intelligence from afar? Why risk sending Russians to the United States? \nAs I learned from my years speaking with Russian intelligence, they are distrustful if not paranoid. As such, I found that the Russians sought to temper their suspicions by understanding the source that is providing them with intelligence \u2014 something that requires face-to-face meetings. It is why, for example, in spite of my repeated offers to provide intelligence files over email or other ways that did not require us to meet in person, my handlers steadfastly refused and insisted on meeting to speak with me. These meetings, I learned, were critical in evaluating me. If they didn\u2019t trust me, then they couldn\u2019t trust the intelligence I was passing them. Oh the other hand, if they could validate me and trust me as a source then that trust was extended to the intelligence I provided them. \nThere was another reason for relying on trusted assets for intelligence: Protecting the information that Russia sought. The paranoia of Russian intelligence extended to the belief that they were under constant surveillance by the FBI \u2014 a notion that gains credibility in the detailed description of emails and conversations released in Mueller\u2019s most recent indictment. \nThe value of intelligence collected by Russian intelligence officers was severely diminished if the FBI discovered that Russia had collected it, which is why they chose to have me collect intelligence instead of trying to do so themselves. And in an era of endless and potentially everlasting digital breadcrumbs, it was far better to let an America source collect intelligence and hand it over then risk compromise and detection by doing it themselves.\nThat same paranoia, I found, made the Russians highly selective in who they chose to recruit. Showing up with a juicy piece of classified intelligence was not enough. They wanted to understand why somebody would be willing to spy for them. The answer to that question was as important, if not more so, than the intelligence an asset could provide. \nIt was not enough that I was a young man intent on joining the United States Navy as an intelligence officer, my Russian case officer had to believe that I wanted to spy for Russia. This meant creating a persona that would meet the Russian profile of a spy. While I couldn\u2019t change my name or where I lived or went to college, I could invent a caricature of a person I believed the Russians were looking for. So I played the part of a young arrogant man obsessed with money who saw service in the Navy singularly as a way to access information he could sell Russia to enrich himself. It was a profile the Russians understood and accepted, and ultimately the reason they allowed me into their network of spies. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

I am sure that Russia continues to recruit Americans to support its intelligence operations, and continue to have a similar profile of the type of person that is susceptible to such overtures\u00a0\u2014 someone who is willing to sell for profit access and information from the office they hold.\nThere is no longer much question that Russia recruited Americans to help in their attack on the 2016 elections.

For 15 years, Steele has had his race used against him, with the bipartisan critics and the media often amplifying the notion that he has to be kept \u00a0in his \u201cplace.\u201d\nI know first hand, having worked on Michael Steele\u2019s 2006 Senate race and at the Republican National Committee while Steele was chairman. But while I had come to expect it from his liberal opponents, I\u2019m distressed to see the \u201cconservative\u201d movement echo these lines. \nIt began back in the 2002 Maryland Gubernatorial race, when Steele was candidate for lieutenant governor. The liberal editorial page of the Baltimore Sun questioned Steele\u2019s credentials, saying he brought \u201clittle to the team but the color of his skin.\u201d Four years later, the Sun was at it again, patronizingly terming Steele a \u201clikable man and persuasive speaker\u201d \u2013 articulate and clean, anyone?\nSteny Hoyer, the House Minority Whip has called Steele \u201cslavish\u201d\u2014for which he had to apologize\u2014 while Maryland State Senate President Mike Miller called Steele \u201cUncle Tom.\u201d The Democratic National Committee, in a 37-page memo by Cornell Belcher sought to \u201cturn Steele into a typical Republican candidate \u2014 as opposed to an African-American.\u201d \nWhen Steele ran, successfully, for RNC chair in 2009, the dirt continued to be thrown at him. In 2009, MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough declared that \u201cRepublicans are learning right now, that sometimes being black isn\u2019t enough. They thought \u2018we\u2019re going to get a black guy to run our party.\u2019\u201d\nAlways outspoken, but also a former seminarian, Steele handled this with a characteristic mix of class and combativeness. But even as he was able to deal the slings and arrows coming his way, the comments raised serious questions about how much of the political universe views race. \nWith the communications director of CPAC declaring, from the stage this past week, that Steele was elected as RNC chair \"because he's a black guy,\u201d it raises even more serious questions about how Trumpian tribalism has quickly become the rule of law within a large segment of the GOP. \nThis is terrible for our party. \nWhile Republicans may see speaking to minority audiences as a low priority, they should realize that minorities are closely watching them. For African-Americans to see the man who is likely the most prominent African-American Republican on the airwaves, treated this way, is another sign of a Republican Party that is not interested in winning their votes. CPAC is an event I used to attend nearly annually but have not in several years. Over time, the conference has taken more and more of a tribal posture, seeking to cast out what it decides are \u201cbad\u201d conservatives in favor of \u201cgood\u201d conservatives with a roster slouching towards the extreme. Last year it was Milo Yiannopoulos, who was ultimate disinvited from CPAC after sponsors balked. This year, it was Marion Le Pen of France\u2019s National Front, whose politics are so controversial in her home country that French rocker Johnny Hallyday had the family banned from the funeral. Unlike Yiannopoulos, Le Pen was not disinvited. Instead, she was welcomed as a hero, if not the conquering one.\nOf course, CPAC\u2019s conquering hero is clearly Donald Trump. Just two years after canceling his 2016 speech under the threat of a walk out, Trump has become the belle of the ball, fully in control of an adoring audience all too happy to boo Senator John McCain and other Republicans who don\u2019t sufficiently grovel to him. \nDoes anyone honestly believe that these comments would have been said about Steele had he been a Trump acolytes instead of a detractor? The obvious and honest answer is no. That may be fine if Trump is enjoying high popularity. But he is not. He is in a politically tenuous position\u2014with low popularity ratings and an ever-encroaching Russia investigation\u2014not the position of power.\nAll of which puts the GOP in precisely the position many believed the party was heading the day before Trump\u2019s surprise election. It also means that whenever Trump is no longer president, the GOP will still be divided, with limited desire or effort to appeal to minorities, and no road map forward. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Wynn denied the allegations in a statement to the Journal.The report nonetheless puts the RNC in a bind after it made a show of demanding that Democrats return money that Weinstein donated to their campaigns over his years of activity in party fundraising circles. Numerous Democrats ended up giving their Weinstein donations to either charities or, in some cases, political groups who work to elect progressive female lawmakers. Officials at the RNC and those close to it deemed such giving insufficient and accused other lawmakers of being complicit in not forcefully condemning Weinstein. The RNC, which last year chose not to distance itself from another official credibly accused of sexual harassment\u2014Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore\u2014did not respond to a request for comment as to whether they would now do the same. Nor did Sean Spicer, the president\u2019s former press secretary and the committee\u2019s former top strategist, who was particularly aggressive in criticizing Democrats after the Weinstein revelations. Wynn has donated more than $2 million to Republican campaigns, party organs, and interest groups since 2001, according to FEC records. That includes more than $1.3 million to the Republican National Committee (compared with the $300,0000 in donations that Weinstein gave to the DNC) and the party\u2019s House and Senate campaign arms. He also bundled between $250,000 and $500,000 for Sen. John McCain\u2019s presidential campaign.Wynn has also contributed to Democrats, such as the party\u2019s former Senate leader, Nevada\u2019s Harry Reid. He was friends with other prominent Democrats, including longtime Harlem congressman Charlie Rangel.But the vast majority of Wynn\u2019s political contributions, and public advocacy, have been directed towards Republicans. In 2014, Wynn got into a public spat with George Clooney after the actor alleged that Wynn had called President Barack Obama an \"asshole.\" Years later, he became a booster of Donald Trump. Wynn and Trump, whose own Vegas hotel sits near Wynn\u2019s resorts, have been friends for some time, and Trump has even bragged that he helped brand Wynn\u2019s company.In addition to his donations in support of Trump\u2019s election, Wynn spearheaded fundraising for the president\u2019s inaugural committee, which raked in a record-smashing $107 million. He was subsequently appointed as the RNC\u2019s chief moneyman. Under his purview, the RNC has recruited other fundraisers close to the president, such as Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s longtime attorney.Wynn\u2019s relationship with Trump goes back decades, and has been, at least for public show, a rather love-hate reality-TV-style affair. A 1998 New York magazine article documented their feud, and that \u201cTrump and Wynn despise each other so much that they\u2019ve aligned themselves with rival morning-radio proxies.\u201dHowever, in the years since, the two grew closer, to the point that Wynn became one of Trump\u2019s top political allies. Most recently, Wynn co-hosted last Saturday\u2019s gala and fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago celebrating the one-year anniversary of Trump\u2019s inauguration, with proceeds going toward the RNC and the Trump re-election campaign. Ticket prices ranged from $100,000 to $250,000. President Trump was supposed to headline the event, but ultimately could not make it due to the government shutdown. The White House and Trump reelection campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the Wynn allegations.Thank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Based on the positive identification of this chemical agent by world-leading experts at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down, our knowledge that Russia has previously produced this agent and would still be capable of doing so.\n\n\n\u2014 Prime Minister Theresa May\n\nThe person who understands the effects of novichoks best is Vil Mirzayanov, a scientist and later head of Foreign Technical Counterintelligence at the State Scientific Research Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology (GosNIIOKhT) in Moscow in the 1970s and 1980s, which allegedly produced the shadowy class of binary nerve agents known as the \u201cnovichoks\u201d (newcomers). And he has a message for Skripal and his daughter: my bad.\n\u201cI\u2019d tell him [Skripal] that I\u2019m very sorry that I participated in the development of these weapons,\u201d Mirzayanov told The Daily Beast.\nGosNIIOKhT scientists developed the agents under a program codename \u201cFolio\u201d beginning in the 1980s. Mirzayanov spoke out about the covert program as the Soviet Union fell, earning him a prison term at home before he escaped to exile in the United States.\nDuring the Cold War, the idea that a novichok agent would be used in a covert assassination seemed alien to Mirzayanov and his fellow scientists. The weapons, developed in intense secrecy by Soviet scientists, were originally designed for use in bombs and shells on a battlefield rather than a cloak-and-dagger assassination in a suburb in southern England. \n\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine. No one could imagine. It\u2019s outrageous. We were convinced at the time that we were developing these weapons and testing others for the protection of the country and for defense,\u201d Mirzayanov said. \u201cIt was not our goal. None of the scientists supposed that it would be used with terrorist goals. It was a military thing. It was a weapon for mass killing.\u201d\nDespite the lethality of novichok agents\u2014reportedly 10 times as powerful as the VX nerve agent used to assassinate Kim Jong Un\u2019s brother in a Malaysian airport\u2014Skripal and his daughter managed to survive the attack and are recuperating in the hospital. But Mirzayanov expects that the two have a long road to recovery.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re poisoned by a nerve agent, it\u2019s forever,\u201d Mirzayanov said, citing the case of his friend and fellow GosNIIOKhT employee, the late Andrei Zheleznyakov, who was accidentally poisoned by a novichok.\nZheleznyakov received a dose of A-232, a component used in Novichok No. 5, during a laboratory accident in the 1980s. Doctors gave Zheleznyakov atropine, a common nerve agent antidote, and he survived following a lengthy recuperation. But the once vibrant researcher was never the same, according to Mirzayanov: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t capable of functioning normally afterwards.\u201d Zheleznyakov reportedly suffered from chronic weakness, epilepsy, liver problems, and difficulty focusing, among other maladies, before his death five years later.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d tell him [Skripal] that I\u2019m very sorry that I participated in the development of these weapons.\u201d\n\u2014 Vil Mirzayanov\n\nIn Skripal\u2019s case, British investigators may have been able to identify the use of a novichok with help from a portable mass spectrometer, according to Mirzayanov. The scientific devices could detect the presence of a novichok if investigators had reliable information on the chemical composition of the nerve agents.\nFor the prime minister to be able to publicly accuse the Russians of using a nerve agent like a novichok, British authorities at least must have had access to novichok\u2019s unique chemical signature\u2014which it legally could have had despite the Chemical Weapons Convention, due to the clause of countries being able to hold samples for testing in these incidences.\nTesting for novichoks, even based on a formula published by Mirzayanov in a memoir based on his work in the 1980s, is a potential sign that the British have potential access to newer variants of the nerve agent. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nGwyn Winfield\u2014the editorial director of CBRNe World magazine, a trade publication for those dealing with chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or explosive threats\u2014said it\u2019s possible that the Russians continued to develop novichoks in the years after the publication of Mirzayanov\u2019s book. But even then, the British were probably able to reliably gather minute traces with a novichok\u2019s unique chemical signature.\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to detect the phosphate chain, and they [mass spectrometers] are probably looking at broad families detecting something hazardous in the environment,\u201d Winfield added. \nWinfield said it\u2019s also important to note that we don\u2019t yet have any idea what particular novichok variant hit the Skripals and the police officer who responded to them.\nWhen Winfield first heard about the incident, he and other journalists thought it was a fentanyl overdose. \u201cWhen the Salisbury Hospital shut down, [it was done so for] fentanyl poisoning,\u201d Winfield told The Daily Beast. \u201cThat sounded right, that we were looking at two individuals who had overdosed on something.\u201d\nFentanyl wouldn\u2019t be out of the question: Prior to its more recent use in the United States as an opioid, Winfield said the drug has been used for assassination attempts. \u201cIt was effective and inefficient, and there was plausible deniability,\u201d he said, pointing out that victims could be thought to have overdosed.\nWhen Prime Minister May came out and said the culprit was novichoks, Winfield said he was surprised, particularly given that Skripal reportedly became aggressive, waved his arms, and pointed to the sky while yelling in Russian, he said. \u201cThose don\u2019t fit into what we know about organophosphate exposures,\u201d Winfield explained\u2014which means that while novichok is being pointed to as the source nerve agent, it\u2019s possible that it was swirled with another drug that produced hallucinogenic qualities that were more similar to a fentanyl poisoning.\n\n\u201cIf they wanted to kill me, it would\u2019ve been easy. But God has saved me so far.\u201d\n\u2014 Vil Mirzayanov\n\nBut that\u2019s impossible to confirm, Winfield said. \u201cIt might have been a cocktail of drugs, it might have been [Skripal\u2019s] unique physiology,\u201d he surmised.\nThe business of killing with chemicals is an ugly one and it weighed heavily on Mirzayanov\u2019s conscience in the waning days of the Cold War. The former Soviet scientist once in charge of protecting GosNIIOKhT\u2019s secrets from Western spies began a crusade to eradicate chemical weapons with a Moscow News article and an interview with The Baltimore Sun in 1992.\nMirzayanov told The Daily Beast that representatives from the U.S. intelligence community later urged him not to publish chemical formulas and compounds for the production of novichoks because of concerns about the dissemination of know-how for the powerful weapons.\n\u201cThe U.S. government doesn\u2019t like me because they can\u2019t use me like a puppet,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a puppet. I refuse to cooperate the way they want. I told them, \u2018Go to the court and challenge me.\u2019 I believe Russian secrets are not American secrets.\u201d\nThat we don\u2019t know much about the subsequent development of novichoks after Mirzayanov had access to GosNIIOKhT\u2019s secrets means it\u2019s also hard for us to know how the Skripals got sick. \u201cIt could be a gel, vapor, or a liquid,\u201d Winfield said. Nerve agents tend to use corrosive acids, which mean their precursors are usually stored separately, Winfield said, but it\u2019s possible this novichok doesn\u2019t require mixing of chemicals and could be directly applied to a person\u2019s skin or on a surface with \u201cjust a pair of gloves,\u201d he said.\nWinfield said that at this point, there are more questions than answers about novichoks and how they were used in the Salisbury attack. That Skripal, his daughter, and the police officer lived is also puzzling, given that Mirzayanov said practically no human testing occurred, unlike other nerve agents like sarin and VX. The survival of the victims could be due to human incompetence or their unique physiology, or even the cooler temperatures, that saved them.\nWith Russian intelligence veterans like Alexander Litvinenko and Sergei Skripal in the crosshairs of assassins, some dissidents are now worried about their own safety. Mirzayanov, 83 years old and living openly in Princeton, New Jersey, is unmoved by the potential threat from the Russian government.\nAfter he spoke out against GosNIIOKhT\u2019s chemical weapons programs, Russian authorities arrested Mirzayanov and put him in the KGB\u2019s notorious Lefortovo Prison in Moscow. He survived, walking out of a place where so many before him had entered but never left. \n\u201cIf they wanted to kill me, it would\u2019ve been easy,\u201d he says now. \u201cBut God has saved me so far.\u201d", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/sorry-i-developed-the-weapon-that-poisoned-a-russian-spy?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Margaret Carlson", "body": "Gary Cohn resigning as national economic adviser is bad for the adult quotient in the West Wing, as well as for the Dow Jones. \nBut just as big a worry as who\u2019s leaving is who\u2019s staying. Although not the shiny object that Cohn (or Hope Hicks, Rob Porter, or Steve Bannon), cabinet secretaries who would be long gone in any other administration are hanging on, redecorating (see HUD Secretary Ben Carson\u2019s $31,000 desk while removing anti-discrimination language from his agency\u2019s mission), flying flags over their headquarters to signal they are in charge while turning over public lands to oil drillers excepting his home state of Montana (Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke), and increasing security details with a new $25,000 safe room lest anyone hear him endangering clean water (EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt). \nWhile each has violated norms in his own way, one thing unites them: the president is not insisting they leave because they haven\u2019t violated his standard. And that standard is: If you don\u2019t beat your wife with a picture that proves it, or dump all over Trump and his family in a best-selling book, you are doing a helluva job. \u00a0\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions, though, is a special case. Trump would love to fire him, yet he persists, enduring despite the worst insults Trump can think up and spell correctly. Over the weekend, I heard Sessions tell a friend from Alabama that it will take a lot more than Trump\u2019s taunts\u2014specifically \u201ca bullet between the eyes\u201d\u2014to remove him. This may be a relief even to many Democrats who know that any replacement would likely be so much worse. (The Justice Department refused to comment when asked about the Sessions remark.)\nA bullet might not be enough to unseat Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin by dint of multiple Inspector General\u2019s reports detailing dismal performance and ethical violations. Shulkin took a lengthy trip to Europe with as much touring as official business and with his wife along for the ride at taxpayer expense. When his explanation that the trip was approved because he was getting an award, the invitation he offered to prove it was forged. He both claimed the VA was hacked and fired his chief of staff, who did the forging at his instruction. He explained tickets to Wimbledon by claiming they were given to the couple by a \u201cfamily friend,\u201d who it turned out was no such thing. \n\n\u201cPruitt got a waiver to fly on Air Emirates, to protect him from angry Italians on a one-way trip from Milan, an airline known for its cocktail lounge, full beds and hot showers.\u201d\n\nThe latest IG report reveals that Shulkin, the one Obama appointee Trump liked enough to keep, is continuing to run the VA into the ground. Blaming complacency and inattention, the IG found \u201csystemic\u201d failures resulting in a lack of medical supplies, including prosthetic limbs and surgical implants, dirty conditions, chronic understaffing, and 1,300 boxes of veteran\u2019s health information sitting in a hospital basement, a warehouse, and a trash bin. Shulkin is still in his job, despite being pressed to leave by two top aides and a fellow Republican, Rep. Mike Coffman, who heads the panel overseeing the VA. Shulkin\u2019s response has been a pledge to root out dissidents and to hire his own public relations firm. They may well have advised him not to show up on the dais despite being listed in the official program at last weekend\u2019s Gridiron dinner, a spring ritual where official Washington and those who cover them dine together without a food taster. The Daily Beast reported last week that there is another IG report in the works, this one on Shulkin using staff for personal errands. \nWho did show up at the Gridiron was EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. Almost no one approached him during the break despite his insistence that he\u2019s so recognizable it\u2019s not safe for him to fly coach. In one day that cost the taxpayer $14,434 when Pruitt commandeered a government jet to fly from Tulsa to Oklahoma City, about $300 otherwise, and a one-hour trip from Washington to New York at $1,641.43 rather than about $400. First class domestic is not always enough. He got a waiver to fly on Air Emirates, to protect him from angry Italians on a one-way trip from Milan, an airline known for its cocktail lounge, full beds and hot showers. \nLike Shulkin, Pruitt is paranoid, diverting agents from environmental crimes to expanding his security detail to round-the-clock unprecedented size, and sweeping his office for bugs. On Tuesday, Democratic Senators Sheldon Whitehouse and Thomas Carper sent a letter to Pruitt demanding an explanation by March 21 for how he justified awarding that contract to a business in which a member of his current security detail has a financial interest. That\u2019s reminiscent of another no-bid contract award to the Republican opposition research firm Definers Public Affairs\u00a0last December to search out \"resistance figures\" opposed to his agenda. \nThis pales next to what he\u2019s costing the planet. \"I think there's assumptions made that because the climate is warming, that that necessarily is a bad thing. . . it's fairly arrogant for us to think that we know exactly what it should be in 2100.\" What about the temperature on Wednesday in New York bringing with it snow thunderstorms, a new phenomenon. Pruitt quotes the Bible to defend exploiting the earth, saying that God expects it and hopes it will benefit business. Rescinding the regulation prohibiting the coal industry from dumping their runoff directly into streams benefits mine owners, not mine workers who live nearby.\nTrump is sanguine about Cohn leaving even as he carves out exceptions to the trade war. Trump doesn\u2019t follow his annoying globalist but he does follow the markets. On Tuesday, Trump, who knew Cohn was leaving, said he didn\u2019t mind losing people and that, in fact, he had a few other positions \u201che\u2019d like to change.\u201d \nHe could begin with Shulkin and Pruitt; let another adult, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, stay on; and move on to Carson, who admits running HUD is harder than brain surgery. Trump likes setting records and losing those three for starters would keep up his current one for turnover\u201443 percent in his first year, with fewer than half of the 12 positions closest to him still occupied by his initial choices, according to the Brookings Institution. If, as Trump said Tuesday, people are clamoring to join his staff, he will hardly have time to miss them.

That war, for the past three years, has featured indiscriminate civilian bombing and facilitated a mass famine and cholera outbreak. And its primary mover is the Saudi defense minister and heir apparent, Mohammed bin Salman, ubiquitously known as MBS, who is slated to meet with President Trump at the White House on Tuesday. \nIt\u2019s been a long procedural road for a resolution pushed by independent Bernie Sanders, Democrat Chris Murphy, and Republican Mike Lee to end aid for the Yemen war. Their resolution, introduced in the Senate foreign relations committee on March 1 and therefore ripe for a move to the floor, holds U.S. assistance in that war in violation of the 1973 War Powers Resolution. The resolution\u2019s remedy is not to a congressional vote to authorize aid to the Saudis, but to stop it outright. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could\u2019ve predicted this would occur when the Crown Prince was in Washington, but I think the upcoming public debate on the Saudis\u2019 devastating war in Yemen will send a strong signal about Congress\u2019s growing reticence to continue fueling this conflict,\u201d Murphy told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cWe believe U.S. military support for the Saudis\u2019 war in Yemen is illegal, immoral and harms national security.\u201d\n\u2014 Sen. Chris Murphy\n\nAs early as Tuesday afternoon, The Daily Beast has learned, the senators will push for a so-called motion to discharge the resolution from the committee. If they get a simple majority, it will proceed to the Senate floor for a lengthy period of debate that may stretch into Wednesday. The debate would culminate in a vote, also by simply majority, on immediately ending U.S. military assistance to the Saudi forces MBS commands. \nAll this comes with procedural hurdles. The Pentagon rejects the \u201cfundamental premise\u201d of the antiwar resolution. Its acting top lawyer wrote to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell last month that \u201cthe limited military and intelligence support that the United States is providing to the [Saudi]-led coalition does not involve any introduction of U.S. forces for purposes of the War Powers Resolution.\u201d The resolution\u2019s backers expect that McConnell or another senator will raise that issue to preempt a floor debate. \nBut the antiwar senatorsy think that they have the stronger argument. Section 8(c) of the resolution defines the \u201cintroduction of United States Armed Forces\u201d to include servicemembers who \u201cparticipate in the movement of...military forces of any foreign country or government when such military forces are engaged.\u201d Since U.S. tanker aircraft that refuel Saudi warplanes that bomb Yemen necessarily facilitate military movement, the senators think they can bat back a challenge to their resolution on those grounds. \nThe 32-year old MBS, the son of ailing octogenarian King Salman, rapidly consolidating power, and a portion of that effort runs through Washington. After MBS cultivated Jared Kushner and Trump himself, resulting in Trump\u2019s rapturous reception in Riyadh in May, MBS felt free in November to purge and imprison actual and potential rivals for the levers of Saudi control, particularly the economic ones. While MBS billed it as an anti-corruption effort, the fantastically wealthy Saudis he detained at the Ritz Carlton surrendered what the New York Times called \u201chuge sums of money\u2026 [and gave] government control of precious real estate and shares of their companies,\u201d giving it the air of a shakedown. \u201cOnly death,\u201d MBS told 60 Minutes on Sunday, can stop his ascension to the throne. \nAfter a triumphal heir-apparent tour of Egypt and Britain, MBS and a gigantic retinue are en route to the U.S., which is \u201chis gateway to becoming king,\u201d said Ali al-Ahmed, director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs and a critic of the royal family. \nA Senate fight on Yemen during his visit will make him \u201cvery upset,\u201d al-Ahmed believes, as \u201cthe man does not like to be told no\u2026 He feels entitled to get his way. When he hears from the Senate that that\u2019s what the U.S. wants, if that\u2019s what they say, he\u2019ll be extremely upset.\u201d As defense minister, MBS \u201cdoes not run away from [the Yemen war], he owns it, he says it\u2019s necessary,\u201d al-Ahmed said. \u00a0\nThe U.S. military doesn\u2019t go that far, but it has made clear it considers support for its anti-Iran friend in Riyadh more important than the starvation, disease and deaths of millions of Yemenis. Even though the Murphy-Sanders-Lee resolution does not restrict the military from attacking suspected terrorists in Yemen, a Pentagon document for senators acquired by HuffPost portrayed counterterrorism as collateral damage from a successful resolution, intimating that \u201cSaudi Arabia may reallocate resources from counterterrorism to the counter-Houthi fight.\u201d \nTrump plans on discussing the Yemen war with MBS as well, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on Monday.

Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), was surprised to discover his money\u2014or three of every four dollars of it\u2014had gone to the coffers of consultants and lawyers the group leaned on to fight a libel suit, rather than pushing back against the president. When told by The Daily Beast how the group had spent where his money, Siddiqui was, charitably speaking, not pleased. \u201cBeing an attorney,\u201d he said, \u201cI intend to investigate this further and look forward to receiving a full explanation about the use of donations.\u201dThe Democratic Coalition, one of the many new progressive-minded organizations to bloom in the age of anti-Trump fervor, brought in nearly half a million dollars last year. Its donors include Siddiqui, a pair of Hollywood television producers, a former Real Housewife of Miami, and a member of the U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors. The vast majority of its funds, however, have come from people whose names don\u2019t make it into Federal Election Commission disclosures: the small, \u201cunitemized\u201d donors who give $200 or less.It\u2019s what the group has done with its money\u2014not how much it has brought in\u2014that has raised eyebrows among other operatives. The Democratic Coalition paid more than half of the money it raised last year to its employees or their consulting firms, according to Federal Election Commission records. Dworkin\u2019s Bulldog Finance Group was the chief beneficiary, drawing more than $130,000 from The Democratic Coalition. The breakdown in 2016, when the Democratic Coalition declared its goal was \u201cmaking sure that Donald Trump never became President,\u201d was even starker. That year, Dworkin and other staff members received more than 90 percent of all of the Democratic Coalition\u2019s expenditures, either personally or through a consulting company, according to FEC records.On top of those expenditures, the Democratic Coalition has also spent $127,500 in legal fees since late 2016. Those fees stem from a libel lawsuit brought by a North Dakota doctor who donated $2,700 to the Trump campaign. The Coalition dubbed him a \u201cmajor benefactor of the Trump campaign\u201d and accused him of ties to former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and terrorist elements in that country. The case was settled last summer under undisclosed terms. But the Democratic Coalition never informed current or prospective donors that their contributions would help cover what have turned out to be six-figure legal expenses. \u201cTo ensure we could have as large an impact as possible, we reached an amicable agreement with Dr. Benaissa that includes language prohibiting any of us from speaking about the matter, other than to acknowledge its existence,\u201d a spokesperson for the group said.The apparent self-dealing and large legal expenditures have left some donors to the organization angry with what they see as a waste of money and energy. It\u2019s also left Democratic operatives worried that money is being sent to organizations that are engaged largely in self-promotion at a time when resources are needed for midterm election contests and sustained advocacy against Trump.\u201cHe is conning people into giving him small-dollar donations so he can pay himself and sustain an organization that gains him credibility,\u201d said one top party operative, who agreed to speak candidly about the Democratic Coalition on condition of anonymity. \u201cIt\u2019s a fucking abomination.\u201dThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

They also say that campaigns they are running rely on staff overhead and don\u2019t lend themselves to a the FEC\u2019s periodic disclosure requirements of political activity.\u201cWe've done a ton of work online\u2014much more of it organic social media than paid social media\u2014so most of it hasn\u2019t been the kind of things that get itemized in a FEC report. Instead, they\u2019re expenses paid directly out of consulting fees,\u201d said Chuck Westover, a senior adviser to the Coalition. \u201cThe whole picture isn\u2019t in there.\u201d\u201cOur work has had and continues to have a real impact,\u201d Westover added, \u201cso it\u2019s not a huge surprise that we have attracted some detractors.\u201dThere are no laws governing how much of a PAC\u2019s resources must be devoted to employee compensation or reportable \u201cindependent expenditures.\u201d The only check on how most groups spend their money is donors themselves, and most don\u2019t bother, or don\u2019t know how, to explore the matter before donating small, unitemized sums. Last year the FEC unanimously backed recommendations to Congress for new laws governing groups that exist solely to raise money and pay their own executives, but no such legislation has even been considered.Largely free to operate how they please, groups on the left and right have used dramatic fundraising appeals promising huge political operations to solicit lots of small-dollar contributions (and some larger ones). But little in the way of policy advocacy or political operations ever takes place. Campaign finance experts have a term for this. \u201cWe saw the rise of \u2018scam PACs\u2019 during the Obama years, where grifters would tap into anti-Obama sentiment to raise mostly small-dollar donations from grassroots conservatives, and then pay themselves consulting fees rather than use the money to support candidates or causes,\u201d Brendan Fischer, the director of federal and FEC reform programs at the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center, said in an email. \u201cThe Democratic Coalition seems to be using a similar playbook, only here they are tapping into anti-Trump sentiment.\u201dWhether Dworkin is running the equivalent of a \u201cscam PAC\u201d depends on who you ask. His reputation in progressive circles is decidedly mixed. He was a relatively unknown consultant for years, taking on clients outside the Democratic mainstream. Former Rep. Alan Grayson (D-FL) hired him for fundraising help on his 2006 run. The Florida Democrat ultimately didn\u2019t need the help after building up a massive community of small dollar donors online. But he recalled Dworkin as \u201ccompetent.\u201d \u201cUnlike a lot of people in politics he actually focused on his responsibilities rather than pontificating,\u201d Grayson told The Daily Beast. \u201cAnd that was a good thing. It was worthwhile.\u201d Others have less generous things to say. Fellow Democratic consultants told The Daily Beast that Dworkin had a reputation for running up massive administrative costs and paying himself. They see his current venture as an extension of that crass opportunism. \u201cHe is nowhere near a movement leader. He is a political operative who, in my opinion, targets first-time candidates who often don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know. And he has a trail of frustrated clients and coworkers,\u201d said Nomiki Konst, an operative turned investigative reporter for The Young Turks, who said she once worked with Dworkin. \u201cThe majority of political campaign consultants are in it for the money and not always for the win. But Scott Dworkin is in his own class.\u201dDworkin defended himself against those charges in an email to The Daily Beast. \u201cI don\u2019t call myself a leader of any movement,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI say I help lead The Resistance. It\u2019s a group effort and there are too many moving pieces for there to be only one leader.\u201d\u201cIn regards to candidates,\u201d he said, \u201cI was one of the few people in Washington willing to give a shot to the underdog. To even listen to them. And I\u2019m glad I did. Sometimes no one else would.\u201dOne thing Dworkin\u2019s foes and boosters do agree on is that he has an incredible capacity to pitch\u2014whether it be a cause or himself. \u201cIt is all flash and all substance with him,\u201d is how one prominent Democratic fundraiser put it. \u201cBut he\u2019s a great talker and he is great in meetings.\u201dThe Democratic Coalition certainly has a reputation that exceeds its size or budget. The group, and Dworkin himself, are hyperactive on Twitter, crafting lenthy threads of tweets attempting to draw ties between Trump and the Russian government, or implicate other high-ranking Republicans. Those tweets are frequently punctuated with exclamations designed to draw the attention of journalists and news consumers\u2014Exclusive! Breaking!\u2014but occasionally report information that originated in the mainstream political press hours earlier. Dworkin is now raising money for a new project: an eponymous podcast. He\u2019s brought in just under $15,000 of his $50,000 goal on crowdfunding platform Indiegogo, where his page declares that he and the Democratic Coalition \u201chave worked to lead the Resistance.\u201dDworkin\u2019s Twitter bio is a case study in overstatement too, his detractors say. On it, he lists himself as an \u201cObama Alum.\u201d Few people in the prior administration remember him though. That\u2019s because Dworkin didn\u2019t serve in the administration, per se. He was the deputy director of engagement to the 2012 Democratic convention. Steve Kerrigan, the CEO of the convention committee and now a Massachusetts congressional candidate, recalled Dworkin as \u201ca great addition to our team.\u201dBy that point, Dworkin had begun to establish himself in Democratic circles. During the 2010 election cycle, his firm, Bulldog Finance Group, signed a number of congressional candidates and began bringing in sizable consulting fees. FEC records show federal PACs and candidate committees paid Bulldog more than $875,000 from 2009 through 2016. Dworkin\u2019s consulting business hit a bit of a lull last year, when his firm reported just one federal client beyond the Democratic Coalition: California House hopeful Wendy Carrillo. Instead, he has focused on the Coalition, where his efforts have involved both a robust, often conspiratorial, stream of online postings\u2014including allegations of treason against the president\u2014as well as a stream of legal complaints filed against high-profile Republicans.What the group hasn\u2019t done much of is overt politicking of the kind generally associated with political action committees. It reported just $2,350 in independent political expenditures last year, to pay for two billboards promoting the candidacy of Sen. Doug Jones, the Democrat who scored an upset victory in December\u2019s U.S. Senate special election in Alabama. Billboards are widely considered a waste of political money. Despite the questionable use of its funds, donors don\u2019t seem to be particularly concerned or even all that attentive. One relatively big giver to The Democratic Coalition first said he could not recall actually writing his four-figure check to the group. But when told that he had, in fact, done so, he responded: \u201cI do hope they\u2019ve done something good with our money.\u201d He spoke on condition of anonymity out of embarrassment for not remembering donating his money. The day after talking to The Daily Beast, the donor received an email from The Democratic Coalition asking for money for their next project: A billboard outside of Rep.

The administration\u2019s legislative framework for a bipartisan immigration bill will include a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million people, White House policy chief Stephen Miller told Capitol Hill Republican staffers on Thursday.Miller, describing the White House\u2019s outline as one that includes \u201cextremely generous provisions\u201d and \u201cdramatic concessions\u201d to Democrats, said the administration\u2019s plan allows for 1.8 million undocumented immigrants to have a pathway to American citizenship if they have \u201cwork history, the right amount of education, and good moral character.\u201dMiller spoke on a briefing call for members of Congress and their staff. The Daily Beast obtained an access code for the closed press call. That number includes the nearly 700,000 people currently protected under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, plus individuals who did not apply for DACA \u201cbut otherwise met its requirements,\u201d according to Miller.The legislative framework, which will be released in full on Monday, also includes $25 billion in funds for border security measures including a \u201cwall system.\u201d Miller said the plan also includes a \u201chistoric investment in northern border security.\u201dMiller, a noted immigration hardliner and a close adviser to President Donald Trump, said the White House\u2019s outline represents \u201ca compromise position that we believe will get 60 votes in the Senate.\u201d He said the bipartisan \u201cGang of Six\u201d plan unveiled earlier this month is dead on arrival and \u201chas no chance of going anywhere or ever becoming law\u201d because it does not include what the White House views as must-have provisions.The plan also dismantles the so-called chain migration system, which allows lawful permanent residents to sponsor immigrants who want to come to the United States. Under the Trump administration\u2019s proposal, family sponsorships will be limited to \u201cspouses and minor children,\u201d effectively ending what Miller called \u201cextended family migration.\u201dAdditionally, those changes will not be applied retroactively, meaning that applications currently being considered would continue even after the legislation is signed.Moreover, the visa lottery program\u2014which prioritizes immigrants from parts of the world where immigration to the U.S. is the lowest\u2014will be scrapped in favor of a system that Miller described as \u201chigh-skill based.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Michael Daly", "body": "As we come to the 2018 Winter Olympics, an alleged Russian organized crime boss retains a long-standing world record as the sole person ever indicted for fixing a gold medal.Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov remains a fugitive as the \u201cVor\u201d or crime boss behind Skategate, the fixing of pairs figure skating and perhaps also the pairs ice dancing at the 2002 Winter Olympics. He was indicted by none other than James Comey, who was then the Manhattan U.S. attorney.\u201cHe arranged for a classic quid pro quo. \u2018You line up support for the Russian pair and we\u2019ll line up support for the French pair, and everybody will go away with the gold, and perhaps there\u2019ll be a little bit of gold for me,\u2019\u201d Comey said when announcing the charges.As if that were not enough, Tokhtakhounov went on also to be indicted in 2013 for running a criminal organization involved in money laundering and arms trafficking, as well as a multimillion-dollar gambling operation based in Trump Tower, three floors directly below the penthouse of the man who is now our president.Tokhtakhounov\u2014also known as \u201cAlik\u201d and \u201cTiwanchik\u201d\u2014 is now doubly indicted in the United States, but safely ensconced in his native Russia. He likely remains disappointed in having still failed to achieve what the feds say was his ultimate goal in Skategate: securing a renewed visa that would allow him to resume living in France.According to press accounts, Tokhtakhounov moved from Russia to France in the late 1980s. He reportedly became a kind of expat Vor, described in court papers as being the go-to Russian mafia boss in Paris, engaged in, \u201camong other things, drug distribution, illegal firearms sales, and trafficking in stolen vehicles.\u201d He settled into a beautiful apartment in the 16th arrondissement, reportedly purchased on his behalf by a Russian-Israeli-French \u00e9migr\u00e9 named Arcadi Gaydamak, who figured in a scandal of his own known as Angolagate, which eventually embroiled embroiled Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, son of the French president.In court documents, Gaydamak is said to have to have facilitated the sale of $790 million in weapons during the Angola civil war, from 1993 to 1998. Tokhtakhounov\u2019s other pals are said to include Michael Cherney, who figured in the bloody \u201caluminum wars\u201d in the 1990s for control of the Russian metals business.When Tokhtakhounov\u2019s visa expired, French authorities declined to renew. He moved to Italy, where law enforcement authorities wiretapped his phone as part of Operation Spider Web, an investigation into the laundering of $9 billion in ill-gotten gains siphoned out of Russia.In early 2002, Italian authorities informed the FBI that they had intercepted several phone conversations that offered some insight into an uproar over the gold medal for pairs figure skating at that year\u2019s Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.The Canadian pair, Jamie Sal\u00e9 and David Pelletier, had executed a routine that left the crowd calling for perfect scores.\u201cSix! Six!\u201d Six!\u201dThe performance of the Russian pair, Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, was generally considered inferior, but the judges had voted 5-4 to give them the gold.Thank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The instant controversy prompted the French judge, Marie-Reine Le Gougne, to break down and confess that she had voted for the Russians at the insistent urging of the president of the French Skating Federation (FSF).The French judge subsequently recanted, but her initial admission gained considerable credence when the FBI translated the Italian wiretap recordings.\u201cOur Sikharulidze fell, the Canadians were 10 times better, and in spite of that, the French with their vote gave us first place,\u201d Tokhtakhounov was recorded telling a Russian skating official shortly after the pairs skating completion.\u201cWith one vote we won,\u201d the Russian skating official said.The transcripts show that Tokhtakhounov had gotten the phone number of the Russian official by calling a crony shortly before the Olympics. Tokhtakhounov told the crony that he had been contacted by the mother of Marina Anissina, a Russian-born ice dancer who was competing with the French.\u201cRegarding the Olympics?\u201d the crony asks in the transcript.\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Tokhtakhounov says.\u201cWe will help her,\u201d the crony says.\u201cThat\u2019s a given,\u201d Tokhtakhounov says,The crony provided Tokhtakhounov with the number and assured him that the Russian official would be helpful.\u201c[The official] is close to us, he is a good guy,\u201d the crony says. \u201cHe will do it\u2026 Because there is a lot for him there.\u201dIn the ensuing conversation shortly after the pairs figure skating and shortly before the ice dancing, the Russian official sounds more than happy to do Tokhtakhounov\u2019s bidding.\u201cEverything is going the way you need it,\u201d he tells Tokhtakhounov. \u201cEven if she stumbles\u2026 but it is better if she does not stumble.\u201dThe official says of the upcoming ice dancing, \u201cThe French can only win by the score of five to four.\u201dTokhtakhounov told the Russian skating official that he would call Anissina\u2019s family and let them know. The official told Tokhtakhounov that he would call Anissina and tell her, \u201cI am doing this for Alik [Tokhtakhounov], although I want you to help him with something.\u201dTokhtakhounov informed the Russian official that Anissina had already approached the president of the FSF about helping the mob boss renew his French visa.\u201cShe would do anything, but could not,\u201d Tokhtakhounov says in the transcript. \u201cThat president, he is a homo, promised, but did nothing.\u201d\u201cI told you, the problem is with him,\u201d the Russian skating official says. \u201c[Anissina] strong-armed him, she is one of ours,\u201d Tokhtakhounov says. \u201cShe is one of ours, and she will be an Olympic champion,\u201d the Russian official says.\u201cThank you,\u201d Tokhtakhounov says. \u201dShe will be grateful to you for the rest of her life.\u201dThe Russian official notes that the ice dancer will be performing in five days. \u201cI am telling you that not everything is good with the judging for her,\u201d the Russian official says.\u201cBut you will help, right?\u201d Tokhtakhounov says.\u201c[Anissina] strong-armed him, she is one of ours.\u201d\u2014 Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov\u201cOf course, we will help because you told us to do it, and because the French helped us here,\u201d the Russian official says.The Russian official tells Tokhtakhounov again how helpful the French were.\u201c[The Canadians] performed cleanly and beautifully,\u201d the Russian official says. \u201cTheir scores are 6.0 and they got 5.8 and 5.9.\u201dThe Russian official adds, \u201cWith one vote we won. That one vote was French, because the French have nothing except for the ice dancing.\u201dHe meant that ice dancing pair was the only chance the French had for gold. He noted that in making the Russian-born Anissina a champion they were also helping one of their own.\u201cShe is a Russian girl, and we will feel good about it,\u201d the official says.\u201cOf course,\u201d Tokhtakhounov says.Tokhtakhounov was then recorded telephoning Anissina\u2019s mother.A woman identified as the mother says, \u201c[The Russian official] called me from America, he told me we are going to make [Anissina] an Olympic champion\u2026 Yesterday, the French, the French helped the pair figure skating, gave the last vote. [The Russian official] said, \u2018For this we will make [Anissina], even if she falls, we will make sure she is number one.\u2019\u201dTokhtakhounov tells the mother, \u201c[The Russian official] said he will help, he has two or three judges\u2026 So, make [Anissina] happy, tell her we will help her, and do it all.By then, the uproar over the pairs figure skating gold medal was such that the Russian official may not have felt comfortable enough for a straight fix. The Russian judge did not vote for the French, but the result was just what the Russian official promised Tokhtakhounov.\u201cThe French team won the ice dancing completion by a five to four vote, as [the Russian official] stated,\u201d the FBI criminal complaint notes.A week later, Tokhtakhounov was recorded speaking directly on the phone with Anissina. She told him that she had not called him earlier from America because the president of the French Skating Federation had forbidden her.\u201cThe FBI were interviewing [the president of the FSF] because information came in that [Tokhtakhounov] was involved with the results,\u201d a woman identified as Anissina says.\u201cThat is nonsense,\u201d Tokhtakhounov says. \u201cHe is frightened. There is nothing.\u201d\u201c[The FSF president] came, told me, and they really did check him, the FBI,\u201d Anissina says.\u201cIt was him they were checking,\u201d Tokhtakhounov says. \u201cWhat does that have to do with me? He knows my name very well. He tried to help me, and later made up stuff to scare you, so you would not connect me to him even more. He was protecting himself.\u201dAnissina tells Tokhtakhounov that the Russian skating official had come up to her \u201cyelling at me, \u2018Call Alik, you are such a bitch, not calling.\u2019\u201d\u201cNo, no, no, the reason [the Russian official] said this to you\u2026 a week before your performance\u2026 I contacted your mother\u2026 \u00a0[the Russian official] said, \u2018Alik, everything is OK there even if,\u201d Tokhtakhounov says in a jumble.He then catches himself, \u201cI just don\u2019t want to say now.\u201dThe FBI complaint notes that Tokhtakhounov indicates on several occasions in this conversation that he is concerned Anissina\u2019s phone is tapped. \u201cEverything is good, even if everything turns out badly, it will still be good.\u201dThe complaint suggests Tokhtakhounov \u201cis reluctant to discuss the full scope of the scheme with the female ice dander during this telephone call.\u201dIn the transcript of the call, Tokhtakhounov does quote the Russian skating official telling him, \u201cEverything is good, even if everything turns out badly, it will still be good.\u201dAt one point, maybe out of pride or worry about a wiretap, Anissina tells Tokhtakhounov that she believes she would have won without his help. Tokhtakhounov quotes the Russian skating official as having said before the competition, \u201cEverything will be OK, [Anissina] should not be concerned, let her perform, even if she falls, everything will be OK.\u201dNear the end of the call, Tokhtakhounov sought details of what the French skating official had said.\u201cHe said there are inquiries, he said he was asked about this association with you, he said, \u2018I know him, there was something regarding hockey,\u201d\u2019 Anissina reports.\u201cHe is lying,\u201d Tokhtakhounov says. \u201cWe have nothing in common.\u201dThe criminal complaint notes that the FBI had indeed made inquiries. The president of the FSF told the agents he had been contacted by Tokhtakhounov approximately two years before.\u201c[Tokhtakhounov] contacted the FSF president and stated that the wanted to organize a professional hockey team in Paris, France, which would be operated by the FSF,\u201d the complaint reports. \u201cTokhtakhounov explained that he would give large amounts of money to sponsor athletic teams. After several conversations with the president of the FSF, Tokhtakhounov started that in connection with sponsoring the hockey team, he needed a favor. Specifically, Tokhtakhounov stated that his French visa was expiring and that Tokhtakhounov needed the president of the FSF to assist him in obtaining an extension. The president of the FSF told Tokhtakhounov he would see what could be done.\u201dThe FSF president inquired with the appropriate French government official.\u201cAfter several months, this official told the president of the FSF that Tokhtakhounov\u2019s money is bad and that the FSF should not get involved with Tokhtakhounov,\u201d the complaint reports. \u201cThe president of the FSF informed the FBI that he told Tokhtakhounov that the FSF was not interested in Tokhtakhounov\u2019s proposal and that he had not seen or spoken to Tokhtakhounov again.\u201dThe Olympic Committee sought to rectify the situation by awarding gold medals to the Canadian figure skating pair as well as the Russian pair. Comey\u2019s remedy was to indict Tokhtakhounov. Italian police arrested the accused Olympic fixer and lodged him in the Santa Maria Maggiore prison in Venice.After a hearing in which the wiretap recordings were played, a judge ordered Tokhtakhounov\u2019s extradition.But he appealed, and a higher court found in his favor. He was freed in 2003 after a year in the Venice prison and returned to Russia. He there purchased a small Moscow newspaper and made it energetically pro-Putin. He is also said to have started running from afar a $100 million gambling and money laundering operation headquartered on the 63rd floor of Trump Tower.The New York office was run by Vadim \u201cDima\u201d Trincher, the other senior member of what is termed the \u201cTiwanchik-Trincher Organization\u201d in a 2013 federal racketeering indictment. Trincher was arrested, pleaded guilty, and received a five-year prison term.Now under two indictments, Tokhtakhounov remained safely in Moscow. He had only to think of his associate Viktor Bout to be reminded of the dangers of venturing outside Russia when wanted by the United States.Bout had been arrested in Thailand in 2008 and extradited to the United States on terrorism and arms trafficking charges. He is said to have played a role in Angolagate and also sold weapons to everybody from al Qaeda to the Taliban to Iran to guerrillas in Colombia. He was tried in Manhattan federal court, the same venue where Tokhtakhounov would have been tried had the higher Italian court not overturned his extradition. Bout was convicted in 2011 and sentenced to a 25-year term.Bout\u2019s fate prompted Tokhtakhounov to send the Russian daily Izvestia an op-ed letter, perhaps the first such missive ever penned by an alleged mob boss.\u201cThe problem with these kinds of stories is that the United States regularly and harshly blamed our citizens for some incredible crimes, after which it takes a long time to prove one's innocence and clean oneself of negative impact,\u201d Tokhtakhounov wrote.\u201cThis means that American gain trumps in the political game against Russia, and we have no way to fight it, no recourse.\u201dHe did not likely intend a pun. The world was still six years away from imagining that Donald Trump might ever become president.\u201cAmericans might intervene everywhere, and we, as it turns out, cannot adequately respond. Why can the U.S. authorities arrest a Russian citizen in a third country and extradite him and try him without our intervention? And we do not intervene, because Russia is still in some ways a dependent country. It is difficult for us to utilize strong initiatives to protect our citizens.Tokhtakhounov\u2019s op-ed went on, \u201cIn this case, time is a doctor. Thanks to our current authorities, the country is growing mightier.\u201d\u201cMaybe in five to10 years, in some cases, we'll be able to unzip the fly [on our pants], so to say, and show them.\u201d\u2014 Alimzhan ToktakhounovThe \u201ccurrent authorities\u201d meaning Vladimir Putin.\u201cAnd maybe in five to10 years, in some cases, we'll be able to unzip the fly [on our pants], so to say, and show them.\u201dTokhtakhounov could not likely have foreseen just how right he would prove to be. Putin would essentially do exactly that thanks to the malleable narcissist in the penthouse three floors up from where the Vor set up shop in Trump Tower.In the meantime, Trincher was released to house arrest, which meant he was confined in splendor as federal prisoner 68454-054 directly below the Trump residence all during the presidential campaign and during the first seven months of the new administration. Federal probation officers faced the novel prospect of having to pass through the Secret Service to run spot checks on a felon.As for Bout, he has appealed to Trump to allow him to be retried before an international tribunal.And Tokhtakhounov is no doubt greatly enjoying the spectacle of America upending itself like some clown on ice. He has even been able \u00a0to see Comey get fired and smeared.At least the rest of us can watch those beautiful Olympic skaters complete with perfect grace so unlike what we are witnessing in our politics.In these Winter Olympics, it is even legit, unless somebody is out there trying to match Tokhtakhounov\u2019s world record for fixing a gold medal.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-russian-mobster-who-fixed-the-winter-olympics?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Caleb Gayle", "body": "Last year, then White House chief strategist Steve Bannon declared\u00a0his \u201cline of work is destruction of the administrative state,\u201d so that \u201cif you look at these cabinet appointees, they were selected for a reason and that is destruction.\u201d \nMy home state of Oklahoma was quietly doing this long before Bannon announced the plan. Last week, Alicia Priest, president of the Oklahoma Education Association made her way to the pulpit of a well-attended press conference to demand, among other things, a $10,000 pay raise for teachers, who are among the nation\u2019s lowest paid, just below their counterparts in West Virginia. That came after years of losing talented educators to neighboring states, and after legislators this year blocked a pay raise for teachers. Prist then talked about \u201cdrastic efforts to save public education,\u201d drawing national headlines for her talk of a teacher strike beginning on April 2. \nWhile public school teachers may be among the most recent, easily identified and best organized victims of the destruction of the administrative state, they\u2019re hardly the only ones in Oklahoma. Subtle in some ways and overt in others, the erosion of the state government from within has been underway here \u00a0nearly a decade, since Republican Mary Fallin became governor in 2010 on a platform of reducing income taxes and cutting state spending while giving even more support to the oil and gas industries.  \nIn Oklahoma, companies drilling for oil and gas do not pay property taxes on the land holding their reserves, resulting in a \u201cgross production tax\u201d of approximately 3.2 percent, compared to 8.3 percent in Texas and 13.4 \u00a0percent in  Wyoming. In 2015, that tax cheme amounted to a $470 million dollar break\u2014draining money that could have gone to the state. \nFallin finally got her tax cut 2016, a .25 percent trim that cost the state nearly $157 million dollars that fiscal year. That, coupled with price fluctuations for the state\u2019s darling industry, oil and gas, opened up a gaping budget deficit that\u2019s compelled more cuts at already overstretched and underfunded agencies across the stat\u2014many with secretaries, directors and commissioners who had already been sticking out their necks for the axe. \nThe same year Fallin came to office, Scott Pruitt, now Trump\u2019s administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, became attorney general of Oklahoma. Though not appointed by Fallin, he worked as part of her administration to weaken the powers of his office, eliminating its \u201cenvironmental protection unit,\u201d and zeroing out the budget for environmental law enforcement. In its place, he created a \u00a0new Federalism Unit to fight national environmental regulations.\nFallin did appoint Dr. Terry Cline, a holdover from previous administrations, to serve as both Commissioner of the Oklahoma State Department of Health and Secretary of Health and Human Services (OSDH). Decreases in the tax-base and budget troubles hit Cline\u2019s departments the hardest. OSDH sought to reduce costs by furloughing any employee making above $35,000 one day every two weeks and cut funding for nine child abuse prevention programs and 25 health centers. Recently, the department announced its intention to cut its workforce by 12 percent. \nAs the health agencies\u2019 budget problems worsened, Commissioner Cline resigned in October 2017 after the State Board of Health called out his mismanagement. The FBI and the Office of the Inspector General of US Department of Health and Human Services launched an investigation into the use of federal funds at the state\u2019s health department, whose financial situation became so dire that then-Interim Commissioner Preston Doerflinger warned salaries would go unpaid without emergency funding from the legislature.\nBut Doerflinger\u2014who resigned last month amid domestic abuse allegations from 2012\u2014is no fiscal hero here. Rather, he played one of the most significant roles in damaging both the state\u2019s ability to function but also its reputation. \nBefore his brief stint as interim health commissioner, Fallin had appointed Doerflinger to be secretary of Finance and Revenue. In this role, he architected the entirety of Fallin\u2019s fiscal policies and the drastic cuts that resulted from them. In 2016, he oversaw a 16 percent reduction in higher education funding.

But at a committee meeting on Monday, he declined to give members details that were requested about the direction of that investigation, The Daily Beast has learned. At a committee meeting on Monday evening, members voted unanimously to release a Democratic rebuttal to Nunes\u2019 instantly-infamous memo, which alleged the FBI improperly sought authorization to surveil a former Trump campaign adviser. But while the vote was unanimous, the committee hearing was tense, according to multiple sources familiar with the proceedings.Members on the committee wanted Nunes to provide additional detail on his efforts to investigate the DOJ and FBI\u2014an inquiry Nunes first confirmed to Democrats last week, as his justification for denying Bureau and Justice officials a chance to detail their objections to the release of his memo. Nunes, according to sources familiar with the matter, declined to share details of that investigation with members. That might seem like a small, passive-aggressive moment in yet another of Capitol Hill\u2019s endless partisan squabbles. In reality, it\u2019s much more. Nunes and his White House allies already have put enormous pressure on the FBI\u2019s leadership. A deputy FBI director named in the document has stepped down, and the Justice Department official overseeing the Russia probe\u2014Rod Rosenstein, lifelong Republican\u2014is facing increasing criticism fellow Republicans. Three quarters of Trump voters now say the FBI is biased against the president, according to a recent poll.Nunes\u2019 next steps could go even further to undermine public faith in the various probes into the Trump-Russia nexus. And what makes the situation particularly unusual is that the committee\u2019s rules require its chairman to consult with the top member of the other party when starting a probe. Adam Schiff, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, told reporters last week that Nunes did not consult with him before starting his new investigation.It\u2019s the latest example of a jagged divide between the committee\u2019s Republicans and Democrats. Those tensions came into relief over the previous few weeks, when Republicans pushed to release the controversial memo Nunes\u2019 staff wrote. The document claimed that senior officials at the FBI and Justice Department misled a secret surveillance court about the political provenance of ex-British spy Christopher Steele\u2019s dossier when asking a judge to permit surveillance on Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page. House Republicans, who led a weeks-long social media campaign to #ReleaseTheMemo, said it revealed corruption of the worst kind; Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican, tweeted that the memo\u2019s allegations were \u201cworse than Watergate.\u201d President Donald Trump declassified that memo last week. And several errors in its text quickly became evident, including one of its primary assertions. The document claimed that DOJ attorneys never told the court that political partisans funded some of the material they referenced in their application to surveil former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page. In the days since the memo\u2019s release, however, Nunes and Rep. Trey Gowdy ,who supervised the its production, both conceded that the application included a footnote saying partisans were involved in funding some of its material.On Trump-favorite TV show Fox and Friends, Nunes pivoted Monday to say that \u201ca footnote saying something may be political is a far cry from letting the American people know that the Democrats and the Hillary campaign paid for dirt that the FBI then used to get a warrant on an American citizen to spy on another campaign.\u201dIn other words: Nunes went from claiming that the FBI misled the court, to saying the Bureau had notified the judges\u2014just not in big enough type.Though the narrative spun in memo suggests that Steele\u2019s information was the most important element of the Page surveillance, it doesn\u2019t actually go that far. Instead, Nunes\u2019 memo calls the Steele dossier an \u201cessential part\u201d of the surveillance application on Page, all without clarifying how. (Court filings, however, show the FBI knew Page was in contact with Russian spies as far back as 2013.) The furthest the memo goes in establishing the dossier\u2019s centrality to the Page surveillance is a citation to outgoing FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe claiming \u201cno surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information,\u201d but sources familiar with McCabe\u2019s testimony told The Daily Beast on Friday that the memo mischaracterizes McCabe, who didn\u2019t make that claim.Thank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Nor was surveillance on Page the genesis of the FBI Russia probe that special counsel Robert Mueller inherited. On its final page, Nunes\u2019 memo concedes a core premise: Information concerning \u201cfellow Trump advisor George Papadopoulos\u2026 triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016.\u201d On Fox  Friends, Nunes downplayed what his own memo described. \u201cAs far as we can tell,\u201d adviser Papadopoulos \u201cnever even had met with the president,\u201d Nunes said. That\u2019s incorrect: Trump himself tweeted a photo of himself at a meeting with a visible Papadopoulos.\u00a0(\u201cHe\u2019s an oil and energy consultant, excellent guy,\u201d Trump told the Washington Post in 2016 about Papadopoulos.) Papadopoulos is now cooperating with Mueller\u2019s team. \u00a0\u00a0The rhetoric from Trump and his allies has not reflected any of this. Trump claimed Nunes\u2019 memo vindicates him in the Russia probe \u2013 despite Republican members of the intelligence committee backpedaling that the Nunes memo \u201cis not a rebuke of Bob Mueller\u2019s investigation,\u201d as former CIA officer and committee member Rep. Will Hurd said at a Monday forum. Nunes instead told Sean Hannity \u2013 who had earlier said the memo would make Watergate look like \u201cstealing a Snickers bar from a drugstore\u201d \u2013 that the \u201cbigger problem, challenge here, is that the mainstream media is totally uninterested in this. Can you imagine if the shoe was on the other foot?\u201d Nunes also asserted that the \u201cclear link to Russia\u201d was Hillary Clinton, not Trump. \u201cIt seems the counterintelligence investigation should have been opened up on the Hillary campaign when they got ahold of the dossier,\u201d he told Hannity on Monday night. \u201cIn other words: Nunes went from claiming that the FBI misled the court, to saying the Bureau had notified the judges\u2014just not in big enough type.\u201dAfter Monday\u2019s committee vote to release a Democratic rebuttal to Nunes\u2019 memo\u2014which Trump must decide to release by Friday\u2014Schiff, the senior Democrat on the panel, dismissed Nunes\u2019 additional efforts at looking beyond Trump-Russia questions. \u201cWe hope these phases of distraction will come to an end and once again the committee will focus on what the Russians did to interfere in our election,\u201d Schiff said.The controversy surrounding the memo has not deterred Nunes\u2019 investigative efforts, and has exacerbated the partisan acrimony among committee members.

A host of Intelligence Community leaders shared a litany of concerns about dangers from around the globe. Then Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, asked Wray about \u201cthe counterintelligence risk posed to U.S. national security from Chinese students, particularly those in advanced programs in science and mathematics.\u201d Wray took it from there. \u201cThe use of non-traditional collectors, especially in the academic setting\u2014whether it\u2019s professors, scientists, students\u2014we see in almost every field office that the FBI has around the country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just in major cities. It\u2019s in small ones as well, it\u2019s across basically every discipline. And I think the level of naivete on the part of the academic sector about this creates its own issues.\u201d What\u2019s more, Wray added, the Bureau is actively investigating some Chinese government-backed groups that facilitate dialogues between Chinese and American academics. It was a rare revelation of active FBI investigations\u2014one that drew pointed criticism from Asian-American advocacy and student groups.OCA-Asian Pacific American Advocates, a group that works on issues related to Asian American and Pacific Islanders, said in a statement that they found Wray\u2019s comments \u201cdishonest and insulting.\u201d \u201cIt is dangerous and irresponsible for him to accuse many individuals seeking a higher education, or to contribute to their field of study, of spying,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHis remarks only further insinuates that Chinese and Chinese Americans continue to be treated racially profiled as perpetual foreigners in the intelligence community,\u201d the statement continued. And Jason Li, who heads Stanford\u2019s Asian American Students Association, also criticized the comments.\u201cWe strongly denounce Director Wray\u2019s comments, which fall in line with a long history of targeting, vilifying, and scapegoating immigrants under the cloak of national security,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cInternational students are our friends, our colleagues, and our family...This overreach of national security harms our communities, and we condemn Wray\u2019s statements in our fight against racial profiling and discrimination.\u201dThe FBI declined to comment on a request for additional details about Wray\u2019s comments. A spokesperson for Rubio did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wray isn\u2019t the first FBI official to raise concerns about Chinese government activity and medical research. Thank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

In some cases, he said, government-backed hackers have stolen health data. But in other cases, Americans give away this data to Chinese government-backed labs that specialize in DNA sequencing and diagnostic tests, You said. American health and academic institutions work with these labs, sharing tens of thousands of Americans\u2019 personal health information with these government-backed entities. He described the situation as \u201ca ticking time bomb.\u201d Rubio spurred Monday\u2019s comments, and said that while the Kremlin poses major threat, China is \u201cthe biggest issue of our time.\u201d It\u2019s a view that\u2019s increasingly common in the Trump administration, which has considered curbing the number of foreign students studying STEM to \u201censure that intellectual property is not transferred to our competitors...such as China.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re exploiting the very open research and development environment that we have, which we all revere,\u201d Wray said in response. \u201cBut they\u2019re taking advantage of this. One of the things we\u2019re trying to do is to view the Chinese threat as not just a whole of government threat, but a whole-of-society threat, on their end. And I think it\u2019s going to take a whole-of-society response by us. It\u2019s not just the Intelligence Community, but it\u2019s raising awareness within our academic sector, within our private sector, as part of defense.\u201dWith foreign students taking up a \u201clarge majority\u201d of graduate STEM enrollment, it seems that the FBI has taken this to be an intelligence risk. Intersections of the academic world and alleged Chinese espionage aren\u2019t unprecedented. In 2015, the Justice Department announced the indictment of six Chinese nationals, including two who met while working on a Defense Department-funded research project as students at a Southern California university. They later stole trade secrets from their employers, which they shared with a university in China, according to the indictment, which said that university went on to use the information to get military contracts. Court filings show the prosecution is underway. \u201cWe understand there is a real threat coming out of China, but expect that top-notched intelligence agencies have better tools to rely on than racial profiling every Chinese person coming to America.\u201d\u2014 John C. YangEspionage isn\u2019t the only concern Rubio and Wray discussed at the hearing. Rubio asked Wray if he worries about the Chinese government-funded Confucius Institutes, which partner with American universities. The senator said one concern, which he recently shared with Institute-partnered universities in Florida, is that these programs aim to covertly change American public opinion on the Chinese government by whitewashing its human rights abuses. Neither Rubio nor Wray went into detail about the Institutes. But the FBI Director said the Bureau has opened investigations into some of them. \u201cWe do share concerns about the Confucius Institutes,\u201d Wray said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been watching that development for a while. It\u2019s just one of many tools that they take advantage of. We have seen some decrease recently in their own enthusiasm and commitment to that particular program, but it is something that we\u2019re watching warily and in certain instances have developed appropriate investigations into them.\u201dJohn C. Yang, who heads Asian Americans Advancing Justice, called the whole interchange an affront to the American way. \u00a0\u201cWe cannot have every Chinese student or scientist assumed guilty until proven innocent of a national security threat,\u201d he said. \u201cWe understand there is a real threat coming out of China, but expect that top-notched intelligence agencies have better tools to rely on than racial profiling every Chinese person coming to America.\u201d", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/fbi-directors-shock-claim-chinese-students-are-a-potential-threat?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matt Lewis", "body": "This may be a problem that only Donald Trump could fix. In the wake of another tragic shooting, both sides of the political spectrum immediately adopt reductionist solutions: For liberals, gun control is the only answer\u2014even though it\u2019s often hard to see how a given law would have prevented a given tragedy. For conservatives, the solution is dealing with mental health (though this often comes across merely as a way to parry the debate, altogether) and arming teachers with guns. \u00a0Anyone who objects to the notion that gun control is the only solution is generally portrayed as evil, uncaring, and a tool of the NRA. Anyone who supports even modest commonsense gun control is either a gun-grabbing fascist, or a patsy who is opening the door for mass gun confiscation. What if both sides have it wrong? What if this is a much more complex problem that will require a combination of overlapping common-sense solutions? And what if we have just the man to make this sales pitch? Ironically, Donald Trump may be the only man who could thread this needle. In doing so, he could gain popularity and cement a lasting legacy. That\u2019s because Trump is viscerally trusted by blue-collar gun owners, a fact that grants him the flexibility to make deals that would brand other Republicans a \u201csellout.\u201d There\u2019s also reason to believe he might actually be philosophically amenable to this. In his past life, the New York billionaire supported moderate gun-control measures. In his 2000 book,\u00a0The America We Deserve, Trump wrote: \u201cI generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.\u201dWhat if Donald Trump was actually serious about championing a comprehensive set of solutions that dealt with the complex causes of this problem? The honest truth is that I suspect there are many factors contributing to the school shooting trend\u2014and that any solution must include a multi-pronged response. \u00a0On one hand, we can look at the fact that other developed countries do not experience these school shootings and draw some conclusions. Some of this may well have to do with some deep-seated cultural differences (American exceptionalism in its worst form, if you like), but our Second Amendment, and the concomitant gun laws, are at least a part of the equation. But it seems to me that any sincere effort to actually address this problem (as opposed to scoring political points) and gain enough votes to actually pass something would involve: (a) some form of common sense gun control; (b) the ability for parents and authorities to force a child to obtain mental treatment, and for law enforcement to monitor (and in the most serious cases, detain) those deemed truly dangerous; (c) dramatically increased security at schools (and I\u2019m open to teachers packing heat\u2014but that\u2019s not the only option); (d) a public information campaign aimed at preserving a strong family structure\u2014and raising awareness about parent\u2019s responsibilities to report behavior that is spinning out of control; (e) policies that empower the police and F.B.I. actually follow protocols and aggressively pursue tips\u2014as well as severe punishments for officers who fail to investigate; (f) stronger efforts to stop school bullying; \u00a0(g) a serious effort to voluntarily curb, shame, or censor violent entertainment aimed at children\u2014particularly violent \u201cshooter\u201d games.Thank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Could this actually get done?I should probably concede that I thought Donald Trump had a similar opportunity to tap into the \u201cOnly Nixon can go to China\u201d narrative by backing a compromise immigration reform agenda. The fact that four different immigration bills failed to make it out of the Senate on Thursday does not bode well for those of us who want to believe that our political system is still not broken. And this issue is actually much harder to fix than immigration. There are good reasons why it\u2019s almost impossible to fix any of the fundamental problems that are leading to this crisis. Any change to gun laws has to comport with our Second Amendment rights, and would have to overcome objections that it is a stepping stone to confiscation. Moreover, conservatives may say they want to empower law enforcement to intervene in the case of someone struggling with mental problems, but this is in tension with our \u201cBig Brother\u201d fears and our libertarian impulses. Mistakes, no doubt, would be made. \u00a0Do we really want to empower loved ones to have us committed just because we\u2019re going through some weird \u201cGoth\u201d stage in middle school? The notion of censoring violent entertainment sounds similarly anti-American and prudish (see Tipper Gore). And the idea that schools should have metal detectors would be a tacit admission that we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore. Likewise, the idea that teachers should be armed to the teeth seems simultaneously dystopian and laughable\u2014even though it\u2019s an idea any parent who has been told an active shooter is on campus would immediately support. I guess the question is: Do we really want to get serious about this, or not? What\u2019s the alternative? Wait until he next school shooting?Our greatest hope for action may be that it would be in Trump\u2019s self-interest (whether he knows it, or not) to actually fix some of our problems.At the risk of sounding clich\u00e9d, because his biggest backer was the NRA, Trump could also have a \u201cSister Souljah\u201d moment. I know what Bill Clinton would do here, but Donald Trump has shown no inclination to move beyond his base\u2014even if it meant pleasing the general public.It won\u2019t be easy. But (ironically) America has elected the guy who could possibly get it done\u2014if he only cared to. \u00a0The sad truth is that I don\u2019t expect anything to happen. This cynicism is a product of experience. The smart political analysis is to say that if Newtown couldn\u2019t get people to take this serious, what will? There are a million reasons why this hasn\u2019t gotten done these last 20 years, but as a father of two school-aged children, there are two really big reasons I want this fixed now.

Murray Energy donated $1 million to America First Action on August 8, according to newly released Federal Election Commission records. That was four days after its CEO, Robert Murray, personally appealed to the White House to prop up a struggling utility that buys coal from his company. The administration ultimately did not intervene. Though officially independent from campaigns, super PACs can accept unlimited contributions from corporations and labor unions, whereas political candidates are generally limited to accepting just $5,400 per election cycle and cannot take corporate money (Murray has not yet donated to Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign). Critics say that makes the groups ideal vehicles for donors and private companies looking to buy access with elected officials or grease the wheels of the federal bureaucracy.But while many donors are simply seeking general political good will, the timing of Murray Energy\u2019s donation to America First suggests that it had a very specific policy measure in mind. America First and its \u201cdark money\u201d nonprofit arm work closely with the White House. And at the time of Murray Energy\u2019s donation, utility FirstEnergy, one of its biggest coal customers, was \u201con the verge of bankruptcy,\u201d Murray told the White House in an August 4 letter.

He estimated that a failure to prop up FirstEnergy would cost his company more than $4 billion. In fact, he said, \u201cno other viable alternative\u2026will stop the certain collapse of much of the thermal coal industry.\u201dThe Trump administration rebuked the company, and declined to issue the order that Murray sought.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on Tuesday that he would \u201cvery much like to\u201d merge those two efforts. And the appetite among the rest of the caucus for doing so is surprisingly strong, aides and lawmakers say..\u201cI\u2019m keenly supporting those pieces of legislation and I think the continued arrows shot at the department and the knowledge that they took one run at Mueller already is a sign that we need to find a way to get this done,\u201d Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) told The Daily Beast. \u201cI agree with any strategy that helps get it done. That\u2019s the prime goal.\u201dSen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), a co-sponsor of one measure to shield Mueller, told The Daily Beast that the party should do \u201canything we can do to get this done as quickly as possible.\u201dBut such a strategy does not come without risks. Democrats have few, if any, levers to force Republicans to add legislation shielding Mueller into a government funding bill. And if the GOP chooses not to do so, Schumer would have to either accept defeat or choose not provide the votes needed to keep the government open until it is included.\u201cI think we need to think carefully about how we\u2019re approaching it. My priority is to get the funding bill done,\u201d Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) told The Daily Beast, expressing concern that a political fight over shielding Mueller could imperil ongoing budget talks.Democratic aides stressed on Tuesday that no lawmaker was considering, let alone advocating for, a strategy that would use the threat of a shutdown to force consideration of the special counsel protection legislation. The conversation, one aide said, was merely about mounting an aggressive campaign to encourage GOP officials to consider placing that legislation in a government funding bill.But even that push has potential downsides. As one aide noted, it could complicate efforts to present the legislation\u2014which has Republican co-sponsors\u2014as being the product of bipartisan consideration and concern.\u201cOne thing I will say is a strong issue is we don\u2019t want this to be seen as a Democratic thing,\u201d said the Senate Democratic aide. \u201cThe second it ends up on a Democratic wish list for negotiations we fell like it is an unhelpful place to be.\u201dIn addition to exploring how to leverage a government-funding fight, Democrats are also considering other avenues for elevating the Mueller-shielding legislation. Some ideas are more dramatic than others, including a proposal to have a member launch a filibuster-like speech on the floor to tout the necessity of legislation. \u201cThe only way you get it into law is to put a spotlight on it,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, President Barack Obama\u2019s former communications director. \u201cWhat you need to do is get Republicans on the record and force them to say they are for it or not. But the only way to do that is to make it an issue.\u201dSuch an idea has been executed before, notably by Senator Rand Paul (R-KY.) when he spoke for 13 hours straight about America\u2019s drone policy. \u201cReally you just need someone who has strong legs and a large bladder,\u201d said Pfeiffer.

Instead, the party is also looking into making a heightened push to force a merger of the two existing bills\u2014which are still being reconciled\u2014 through the Senate Judiciary Committee and on to the Senate floor.Democrats feel as if they may be able to push a bill through that committee since the chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), has held a hearing on the matter and appeared open to supporting it. But the bill would inevitably face a tough path forward through the Senate. On Tuesday, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) declared that he saw no need for the legislation, even amid recent reports that Trump ordered that Mueller be fired last June, only to be talked down by his White House counsel, Don McGahn. Both pieces of legislation were introduced in August amid Trump\u2019s suggestions that the special counsel was conducting an unfair investigation that included his finances. The exact mechanics behind both bills are slightly different, but they both provide a legislative backstop in the event that Mueller\u2014or any special counsel going forward\u2014is removed without cause. Both pieces of legislation also have a Republican co-sponsor\u2014Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.). But in recent weeks Tillis\u2019 enthusiasm for passing a bill has cooled. And aides involved in merging the two pieces of legislation say that progress has been uneven. Democrats had hoped\u2014indeed, assumed\u2014that revelations that Trump had flirted with firing Mueller would compel more Republican lawmakers to support the measures. But the absence of that groundswell has convinced some members that they need to more aggressively demand that their counterparts take a position one way or another. \u201cI have to say I\u2019m really appalled by our Republican colleagues in reference to this,\u201d Schumer said on Tuesday. \u201cThey\u2019ve always been defenders of the FBI and protagonists of Putin, and they seem to have flipped.

Adam Schiff, claimed after prevailing in a unanimous committee vote on Monday that his document would reveal \u201cmany distortions and inaccuracies in the [Republican] memo.\u201d The vote came hours after Trump taunted Schiff on Twitter. And it was an abrupt reversal for the committee Republicans, all of whom voted against releasing the Democratic document last week\u2014something their Democratic colleagues said was a political stunt to ensure the pro-Trump narrative laid out in the Nunes memo had days to circulate unrebutted. Schiff said Monday night that the Republicans\u2019 transparency rhetoric placed them in an \u201cunsupportable position\u201d to reject the Democratic memo.Much as with last week\u2019s disclosure of Nunes\u2019 memo, Trump now has five days to object to the release of the Democratic counter-memo. Should he, the full House can vote to override Trump and release it. Asked ahead of the Monday committee vote if the FBI had reservations about the release of the Democratic memo, the bureau declined comment. \u201cNunes dodged a question last week from a Democratic colleague as to whether the White House aided in his memo\u2019s creation. He reportedly did the same thing in Monday afternoon\u2019s committee hearing.\u201dNunes\u2019 four-page document, released on Friday after a weeks-long hasthtag campaign, claimed that senior Justice Department and FBI officials manipulated a process for securing court-authorized surveillance against Trump campaign foreign-policy adviser Carter Page. It confirmed that Page had indeed been the subject of foreign-agent surveillance, something intelligence agencies and their oversight committees are typically loath to discuss. Nunes\u2019 memo insinuated that ex-British spy Christopher Steele\u2019s dossier of accusations against Trump aides was the genesis of the Russia investigation that ex-FBI director James Comey has testified began in July 2016. Yet the memo conceded that the surveillance request for Page came later, on October 21, 2016. On its final page, it acknowledged that the \u201copening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation\u201d for the Trump had nothing to do with either Page or Steele, but rather thanks to information concerning a different campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, who is now cooperating with special prosecutor Robert Mueller. Nunes even subsequently conceded that a \u201cfootnote\u201d in the surveillance application for Page indicated that financing for the Steele dossier came from a political entity\u2014 \u2013 undermining another central aspect of the memo\u2019s allegations of FBI and Justice Department misconduct.Once Nunes rejected FBI entreaties to provide additional context, the FBI attacked the memo publicly, saying last Wednesday that Nunes\u2019 narrative contained \u201cmaterial omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo\u2019s accuracy.\u201d The Justice Department called its release \u201cextraordinarily reckless\u201d and said it was \u201cunaware of any wrongdoing\u201d over the Page surveillance. Nunes subsequently admitted he did not read the surveillance application that his memo purported to summarize.The president, for his part, claimed the Nunes memo \u201ctotally vindicates\u201d him, despite its inability to show the centrality of the Steele dossier for a surveillance warrant on Page \u2013 which, in any event, was not the genesis of the FBI investigation into collusion; the Papadopolous information was. Thus far, Trump has not acted on his feelings of vindication and fired deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, a prelude to firing or constraining Mueller. As Republican momentum to release Nunes\u2019 memo intensified, Democrats on the intelligence committee wrote a rebuttal. Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the committee, said on January 24 that the Democratic counter-memo would set \u201cout the relevant facts and exposing the misleading character of the Republicans\u2019 document so that members of the House are not left with an erroneous impression of the dedicated professionals at the FBI\u201d and\u201d the Justice Department.Will Hurd, a Texas Republican on the intelligence committee who joined in the push to release the Nunes memo, stated in a Washington Post op-ed that the Democratic memo \u201cincluded many references that would affect existing intelligence activity.\u201d Through his office, Hurd, a former CIA officer, declined to elaborate, as did numerous Democratic offices contacted for comment. Schiff pledged last week that ahead of any publication of his own memo, \u201cour intention\u201d was to \u201cmake our memoranda, at least, available to the Department of Justice and the FBI, subject to their input and redaction before being made public.\u201d \u00a0Thank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Thus far, Trump has not acted on his feelings of vindication and fired deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, a prelude to firing or constraining Mueller.

According to Schiff, the White House will receive his memo Monday night.During the intelligence committee\u2019s closed hearing last week, an ally of Nunes, Republican Peter King of New York, made a similar argument. \u201cThere are moments in our history when full transparency is required so that all Americans can understand what their government has done,\u201d King said on January 29. Later in that hearing, King, like all his GOP colleagues, voted against releasing the Democratic memo.\u201c\u2018There are moments in our history when full transparency is required,\u2019 the Republican congressman said, just before he voted against releasing the Democratic memo.\u201dAll that \u00a0provided grist last week for Democrats to ready hypocrisy charges concerning their countermemo. \u201cIf President Trump and Congressman Nunes were interested in a full, accurate accounting of why this investigation was launched, they would release Congressman Schiff\u2019s response.\u201d Senator Jack Reed said in a Friday statement. Schiff last week shot back at King behind closed committee doors: \u201cIf it is Mr. King\u2019s position that full transparency is required, certainly full transparency means full transparency, and that would include the minority views as well as the majority views.\u201d Hours before the Monday committee vote, Trump lashed out at \u201cLittle Adam Schiff\u201d as \u201cone of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington\u201d who \u201cmust be stopped!\u201d He subsequently called Nunes \u201ca man of tremendous courage and grit [who] may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero.\u201d Nunes, who has blocked and tackled for Trump from his committee perch for the past year, had previously played a leading role on Trump\u2019s presidential transition team. Nunes dodged a question last week from a Democratic colleague as to whether the White House aided in his memo\u2019s creation. Schiff said Nunes did the same thing in Monday afternoon\u2019s committee hearing, ultimately reading out what Schiff called a \u201clawyerly\u201d prepared statement claiming only that the White House was uninvolved in the drafting of the memo. \u201cThis just looks too much like a rerun of that charade at the beginning of the investigation,\u201d Schiff said. While the committee Democrats solicited \u201cfeedback\u201d from the Justice Department and FBI as to what ought to remain withheld in their memo, Schiff said, the Democrats were concerned Trump would selectively censor its contents in accordance with Trump\u2019s interests.\u201cWe want to make sure the White House does not redact our memo for political purposes and that was a deep concern,\u201d Schiff said.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/your-move-trump-house-intel-oks-release-of-dems-memo?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Gideon Resnick", "body": "Sen.

When CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper asked Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel if his department could have prevented the shooting, Israel answered: \u201cListen, ifs and buts and candy and nuts, O.J. Simpson would still be in the record books.\u201d\n\u201cI don't know what that means,\u201d replied Tapper. Nobody does. What does O.J. Simpson have to do with the price of tea in China (and isn\u2019t he still in the record books)? More to the point, Israel\u2019s flippant reply belies the fact that prosecutors and legal experts told the Miami Herald that the shooter\u2019s \u201ctroubling behavior gave law enforcement plenty of opportunities to investigate and arrest him\u2014and even take away his guns\u2014long before he shot up Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.\u201d What is more, Israel\u2019s weird answer doesn\u2019t comport with reports that at least one of the sheriff\u2019s deputies (and maybe as many as three) waited outside the school during the shooting rampage.\nNow, here\u2019s what I keep expecting to happen: I keep expecting Sheriff Israel to become the scapegoat. I\u2019m not saying he doesn\u2019t deserve serious blame and condemnation (he does). But what I am suggesting is that his incompetence could be used by those who would prefer to do nothing to stem the plague of school shootings to overshadow everything else we should have learned from this whole experience.\nI\u2019m not the only one who suspects that Sheriff Israel is about to become a bogeyman. \u201cNancy Pelosi should watch out,\u201d writes Michael Graham at CBS News. \u201cThe minority leader has a challenger for the GOP's role of favorite Democrat to vilify, and his name is Scott Israel, sheriff of Broward Country.\u201d\nSo far, Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter feed hasn\u2019t turned on Israel. But a few days ago, the president called the deputy who waited outside a \u201ccoward.\u201d On Monday, he continued the attacks, calling him \"frankly, disgusting\u201d and said the other deputies \"weren\u2019t exactly Medal of Honor winners.\" The president has a point, although the notion that Trump would have \u201crun in there even if I didn\u2019t have a weapon\u201d is laughable and unnecessarily shifts attention back to Trump. \nThe danger is that by becoming a convenient foil, Israel makes it possible for people to blame him, call for his dismissal\u2014and postpone making any substantive changes. \nIn the wake of the shooting, I wrote a column outlining a fairly comprehensive reform strategy for preventing the next school shooting. My list included topics such as mental health reform, heightened school security, what I called \u201ccommon sense\u201d gun control (which might include raising the age for buying a rifle to 21, banning bump-stocks, and universal background checks), examining violent culture and entertainment, reducing school bullying, maintaining the family unit, etc. However, it turns out that my ideas aren\u2019t needed\u2014at least, not if you buy into the theory that one bad police department is to blame for this entire tragedy. \nWhat we need are overlapping solutions that serve as a failsafe in case one area (say, law enforcement) drops the ball. We have to have a multi-pronged approach to this complex problem. The best way to ensure that happens is to remember that Sheriff Israel is only one small part of a much bigger problem. \nRevelations of police incompetence also make it less likely that anything bipartisan will happen. Consider Sen. Marco Rubio, who courageously endured booing at a CNN town hall. If the narrative on the right shifts to suggest the shooting was merely the fault of bad policing, he is going to have an even tougher time standing up to the conservative base when it comes to some of the moderate gun control measures he is considering. \u201cWonder if Marco Rubio would still go in national TV and surrender our rights to the rage mob if he knew Scott Israel's credibility would have the shelf life of room temperature cottage cheese,\u201d writes Jesse Kelly, a pro-Second Amendment activist who failed in a bid for Congress to replace Gabby Giffords.\nThanks, Sheriff Israel. \nI\u2019m not saying that we shouldn\u2019t focus on law enforcement\u2019s failures; we should. There\u2019s a pattern with many of these mass shootings and terrorist attacks\u2014red flags are often ignored. Whether it is police incompetence or cowardice, a lack of communication, or bureaucratic red tape that ties the hands of law enforcement, we have to hope that these colossal screw-ups at least result in something positive. \u00a0\nAlong those lines, on Monday, President Trump suggested he was open to \u201cred flag\u201d restraining orders. This idea was championed by conservative writer David French in the wake of the Parkland shooting.

But many people felt frustrated as the news weighed on them Monday, asking Russia\u2019s eternal questions: \u201cHow to live on?\u201d and \u201cWho to blame?\u201d\nSome in the opposition fault what they consider a Western obsession with Putin\u2019s alleged skullduggery, from interference in the U.S. presidential elections to the attempted murder in England of ex-spy Sergei Skripal\u2014and perhaps, over the years, more than a dozen other Putin enemies. Even Putin\u2019s detractors\u2014who wouldn\u2019t put such things past him\u2014 say that politically, internally, the attacks on him and on Russia helped turn out the vote in his favor.\nOn Monday, after Putin\u2019s victory, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov embraced that idea. He called the vote an \u201celoquent\u201d response by the Russian people to \u201cattacks\u201d from abroad, adding that sooner or later the U.S. and Europe would \u201cneed to answer for these baseless allegations.\u201d \u00a0\nWith six more years of Putin stretching in front of them, many in the opposition wondered how they\u2019ll survive. \u201cThis is an authoritarian state, there was no election, Putin simply re-appointed himself for six more years but he is not leaving after six years, he is staying forever,\u201d Anton Krasovsky, an adviser to presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak, told The Daily Beast. Sobchak came fourth at Sunday election, winning only 1.5 percent of the vote. \u201cInstead of crying, we should go and work so that in 12 years, when Putin decides to appoint some security officer like Aleksei Dyumin [a former Putin bodyguard reportedly groomed as a successor], we should be there to compete.\u201d\nBloggers suggested various scenarios, including moving abroad, downshifting, escaping into internal immigration, adjusting their views to fit the system. Once again the defeated opposition felt forced to choose between cooperating with the Kremlin or turning into a dissident movement. On Monday morning the Echo of Moscow radio station reminded its listeners that Putin, who makes all the key decisions in the country, could surprise the nation with any sort of radical measures, including a new iron curtain.\nIn the interview with the newspaper Kommersant, the head of the Russian National Security Foundation, Konstantin Simonov, said the Russian president\u2019s decision-making is completely opaque. \u201cPutin is reminiscent of a black box, nobody knows what is going on in his mind, and the most important thing is that he does not allow any leaks,\u201d Simonov said. \u201cSince there is that black box, people discuss, whisper things, make things up for Putin.\u201d \nPublic vibrations\u2014reactions to signals coming from Putin about the course of his thinking\u2014have been a part of Russia\u2019s reality for almost two decades. People try to imagine and believe what they do not know. It\u2019s almost a matter of faith. But serious analysts, even the most brilliant, have grown weary of the guessing game.\nTanya Felgenhauer, one of the most courageous political observers in Moscow, realized she had lost interest in the election turnout as she watched the many violations in the vote count on the Election Day. \u201cI have no emotions whatsoever for any aspect of that vote. Nothing. Total indifference,\u201d Felgenhauer wrote in a post on Facebook. \u201cI am not angry, I am not mad, I do not laugh, I am simply indifferent. \u201c\nOn Sunday, Putin promised to start thinking about the new government\u2014and immediately news analysts smelled intrigue. Some said that Putin was planning to fire Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, others believed that the President was going to keep his old friend and partner in place. Putin\u2019s inauguration is in May, so Russia has two months to roll this lollipop around in the mouth.\nOn Sunday evening, Putin seemed happy enough with his record score. In spite of the opposition\u2019s calls to boycott the presidential election, 67.5 percent of the electorate showed up at the polls. Putin smiled when journalists asked him if he was going to run in 2030: \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous! Will I sit here until I turn 100? No!\u201d\nMoscow Municipal Deputy Ilya Yashin claims that with Election 2018 Putin demonstrated weakness as a politician. \u201cI would be upset if the real opposition candidate, Aleksei Navalny, had a chance to run against Putin and lost,\u201d Yashin told The Daily Beast on Monday. But Putin didn\u2019t let that happen.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Instead, he offered us all a pure formality just to please himself.\u201d \nThe opposition\u2019s plan, Yashin said, was to come up with a strong single candidate for the Moscow mayoral election in September. \u201cThe struggle goes on.\u201d", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/vladimir-putins-perverse-powers-of-persuasion-won-him-another-six-years-in-power?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jackie Kucinich", "body": "Speaker of the House Paul Ryan\u2019s office shot down a proposal tweeted by Republican House member on Tuesday suggesting Capitol Police arrest \u201cany illegal aliens\u201d who attended the president\u2019s State of the Union address.In a series of tweets from his official account, Arizona Rep.

Both films have lavish action sequences in the overblown style of Michael Bay. Both were massive commercial successes. The former is the highest-grossing Chinese film ever.\nWith the archetype of the Chinese Savior firmly established, attitudes within China are showing a lack of racial sensitivity at best, and a sense of superiority over other races at worst. \n\n\u201cA gala show on state television included a skit that involved an Asian woman in blackface and oversized butt pads and an African actor in a monkey suit.\u201d\n\nIn an infamous incident last month during the Chinese New Year break, a gala show on state television included a skit that involved an Asian woman in blackface and oversized butt pads and an African actor in a monkey suit. Criticisms of the skit were censored. In 2016, an advertisement for a laundry product showed a black man being shoved into a washing machine, only to emerge as a boyish-looking Asian man\u2014with skin of a much lighter hue.\nMoving off-screen, we can see those attitudes play out in Guangzhou\u2019s Little Africa, derogatively called \u201cChocolate City\u201d by locals. Once a vibrant hub where traders from Guinea, Mali, Nigeria, and other African nations gathered or even settled, the neighborhood has been \u201cbeautified\u201d by the city government: street markets that once were abuzz with commerce and camaraderie have been banned; the police maintain a constant presence, checking the passports and visas of the foreigners they encounter; locals often hold the mistaken belief that these outsiders are involved with drug trafficking or prostitution. Many shops have been shuttered. \nAlthough Little Africa was once estimated to be the temporary home of over 100,000 people, few Africans walk its streets now. Sections of the once culturally diverse neighborhood have been paved over to build parking lots and erect pristine residential units; often, the new landlords will not allow Africans to sign a lease.\nA 2008 diplomatic cable obtained by Wikileaks suggests that a decade ago local authorities were \u201cextremely concerned about the high degree of concentration of Africans into a few Guangzhou neighborhoods.\u201d \nThe many entrepreneurs who sought their fortunes by obtaining cheap, sometimes fake, goods in the Pearl River Delta region and shipping them home have been displaced.

Even if they once saw China\u2019s rise as a model to emulate, and came to trade, learn, and grow, a flight back home now seems like the only option.\nChina\u2019s exploitative relationship abroad with African nations became most evident earlier this year. In late January, the French daily Le Monde reported that the Chinese government\u2019s gift of a headquarters building and computer network for the African Union in Addis Ababa contained a back door to facilitate the transfer of data to servers in Shanghai. \nChina\u2019s ambassador to the AU, Kuang Weilin, responded to allegations that China is spying on the AU by calling the findings \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cpreposterous.\u201d\nThe myth of Chinese support for African nations has been perpetuated both at home and abroad, with the $200 million AU complex in Addis as the crown jewel within the narrative of international cooperation fostered by Chinese public funds. But the charm in Beijing\u2019s Africa blitz doesn\u2019t hide the profiteering and wrangling for influence that follow. \nJust next door to Ethiopia, China\u2019s move into Djibouti is a prime example. The tiny east African nation sits along one of the world\u2019s major maritime shipping lanes, and is home to American, French, German, Italian, and Japanese military bases, with the latest addition of a Chinese \u201clogistics and supply center\u201d to the many foreign military installations already there. The Chinese naval facility was inaugurated last summer, and is part of Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s plan to modernize his country\u2019s military, expanding its navy\u2019s blue-water capabilities. \n\n\u201cThe Chinese government\u2019s gift of a headquarters and computer network for the African Union in Addis Ababa contained a back door to facilitate the transfer of data to servers in Shanghai.\u201d\n\u2014 Le Monde\n\nBeijing shells out $20 million a year to lease the real estate for its base in Djibouti, and has already stationed over 1,000 troops there, with sufficient space for 10 times that number if needed. On top of that, the Chinese government has given the host nation loans topping $1.1 billion to upgrade its commercial port, build an additional airport, a railway that stretches to Addis Ababa, and a water pipeline that moves water from Ethiopia. \nSome Djibouti officials have expressed concern about their country\u2019s ability to repay those loans\u2014failure to channel funds back to China would place the nation in an undesirable position in the very near future.\nOver in Kenya, controversy is unfolding around the country\u2019s largest infrastructure project since its 1963 independence. A Chinese-built railway has been designed to be extended through the wildlife reserve just outside of Nairobi. A court ordered that construction be halted as the case is reviewed, but builders and engineers from the China Road and Bridge Corporation have already begun work, with protection from armed guards.\nThe ranking member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Jack Reed, has already warned of China\u2019s influence in African nations. After a recent trip to the region, he said, \u201cWherever we\u2019re going in Africa, they seem to be there, or following close behind.\u201d Under a messy Trump administration, American policy has failed to keep up with the actions of the Eastern superpower. It isn\u2019t even clear whether America aims to cooperate with China on the continent, counter its clout, or implement a combination of the two options.\nBeijing\u2019s goals, however, are much clearer. Chinese industrialists\u2014often with the state\u2019s backing\u2014are eyeing their moves to a new continent as the economic and governance models at home switch gears. \nEthiopia, for instance, has received a cash injection of nearly $11 billion to bulk up its industrial infrastructure, transforming farmland into industrial parks that can house factories that churn out fast fashion clothing items and consumer electronic goods. The country has opened four such parks since 2014, and plans to launch eight more before 2020. Hundreds of Ethiopian farmers have complained of land grabs, displacement, and lack of compensation, as the government clears space for newcomers from Beijing.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how many Friendship Bridges are built, or how many Cooperation Summits are organized.

Those suspects are still being sought.\nThe recovered bomb package, put together with funds provided by ISIS, reportedly included more than eight pounds of C4 and another 12 pounds of dynamite, and would have been used as part of a suicide strike.\nGuti\u00e9rrez had already obtained work as a dishwasher at the targeted cafeteria in order to pull off the attack, which was scheduled for mid-March, before police intervened.

At his arraignment, Guti\u00e9rrez said that he is now dedicated to battling American power and the \u201cnew world order,\u201d according to the Associated Press.\nWhen a Colombian journalist asked him to elaborate on his animosity for Uncle Sam, Guti\u00e9rrez answered, \u201cFor the same reason we all hate them\u2014because they are thieves and conquerors and killers.\u201d\nCESED\u2019s Zuleta speculated that the attack \u201cmay have been planned [for the Bogota embassy] since Colombia has been the most constant ally of the U.S. in the region.\u201d \nZuleta also said certain anti-Latino remarks made by President Donald Trump could have added fuel to the Cuban zealot\u2019s fire:\n\u201cI do believe that Trump's speech and some of his policies generate an increase in anti-gringo sentiment,\u201d he said. \u201cCalling Latinos \u2018bad hombres.\u2019 talking about how they entrap America, \u200b\u200band building walls generates a sense of enmity.\u201d\nNew Recruits\nAlthough other terror groups sponsored by Iran and Hezbollah are known to operate in South America, this marks the first known incursion into Colombia by ISIS. Unfortunately, it likely won\u2019t be the last.\n\u201cLatin America would allow a new ISIS branch a ready opportunity to generate illicit revenues and gain access to military type weaponry, given the narcotics production and smuggling opportunities that exist and with all the armed criminal groups running around with infantry arms,\u201d said Dr. Robert Bunker, of the Strategic Studies Institute at the U.S. Army War College, in an interview.\nBunker pointed out that the region is home to large swaths of \u201cessentially lawless regions\u201d that provide \u00a0\u201cbad actors a certain level of impunity of action.\u201d\nIn fact, would-be bomber Guti\u00e9rrez had been twice deported from Colombia in the past, most recently returning illegally through the nation\u2019s porous southern border with Ecuador.\n\u201c[ISIS] recruitment could be conducted in these zones as well as within slums and jungle areas no longer under governmental control in various regions,\u201d Bunker said.\nDr. Anne Speckhard, director of the International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism (ICSVE), told The Daily Beast that ISIS has its \u201cslick\u201d recruitment tactics down to a science, in large part due to the \u201cimmediate feedback mechanisms\u201d on social media.\nISIS touts can \u201cwatch for who liked, retweeted, shared and otherwise endorsed their materials to identify, and hone in on, and even swarm those individuals for recruitment,\u201d Speckhard said. \nWhen they find someone who likes their materials, ISIS recruiters seek \u201cat first to interest them more, sometimes \u2018love bomb\u2019 them with attention, meet their needs (as most cults do) and eventually overtake them.\u201d\nAntipathy for the U.S., such as that expressed by Guti\u00e9rrez, can also be a flag for terrorist headhunters.\n\u201cISIS has been very good at attracting those with underlying issues to its message of hatred for the West,\u201d said Speckhard, whose ICSVE is actively engaged in producing an anti-ISIS counter narrative, in part by employing terrorists who have defected.\n\u201cCubans have suffered a lot under their government and U.S. anti-Cuban policies [which feeds into] the ISIS message of the West trampling on the rights of other minority communities. ISIS has also used mentally ill people in a similar manner,\u201d Speckhard said. \u00a0\n\u201cIntelligence Work Can Be Useless\u201d\nOutside the Colombian courthouse last week, Guti\u00e9rrez claimed that others would pick up the struggle where he left off. In spite of his arrest, he said, the \u201cseed has been planted.\u201d\nOne strategy to keep that seed from growing into a tree of hate is addressing the root causes of terrorism worldwide, such as poverty and a lack of infrastructure.\nA \u201chearts and minds approach\u201d aimed at stopping the spread of ISIS in Latin America \u201cwould have to be focused [on] educational and economic opportunities [and] basic security[,] so that human rights and liberties can be protected,\u201d in impoverished areas, Bunker said. \nHe also advocated beefed up information gathering, while acknowledging such steps can be limited in the vast wilderness and unmonitored borderlands of South Am\u00e9rica.\n\u201cAn early warning capability derived from HUMINT (human intelligence) networks of agents and informants is always preferred,\u201d he said, \u201cbut is not always a realistic option in some of these scenarios.\u201d \nColombian security expert Zuleta agreed that the Guti\u00e9rrez case highlights the problem of preventing backdoor infiltration of the Americas by ISIS:\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult because there is no radical Muslim community here, and because the [Cuban] terrorist was not Muslim,\u201d Zuleta said, \u201cthis indicates that intelligence work can be useless.\u201d\nICSVE director Speckhard is concerned that the attempted attack in Colombia could be a sign of things to come.\n\u201cWe should expect that ISIS will use mentally and emotionally unstable people as well as true believers in their cause to attack in the West using handguns, vehicles and anything readily available to mount simple but lethal attacks,\u201d she said. \n\u201cThis keeps the brand going and continues to attract more recruits.\u201d", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-isis-terror-plot-to-kill-us-diplomats-in-colombia?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Betsy Woodruff", "body": "A firm helmed by the man who helped run the Republican Party\u2019s efforts\u00a0in Israel is doing lobbying work for an anti-Semitic foreign strongman without registering as an agent of an overseas power.\nTransparency watchdogs called it a likely violation of the rules governing foreign lobbying\u2014the kind of rules that former Trump campaign boss Paul Manafort and Rick Gates were recently indicted for breaking.

BSI is incorporated in Delaware. \nLydia Dennett\u2014an investigator for the Project on Government Oversight, a Washington, D.C., watchdog group\u2014said BSI\u2019s failure to register may be illegal. \n\u201cIt seems very clear that this would be captured by the law,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there\u2019s just enough of a gray area or squishiness in the language that it\u2019s not 100 percent certain.\u201d\nVirginia Canter, executive branch ethics counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said she shared that concern. \n\u201cThey are signing this document on behalf of Hungary,\u201d she said of BSI. \u201cSo it seems to me that that they didn\u2019t register raises questions as to whether or not they\u2019re an unregistered foreign agent.\u201d\nThe filings were first reported by Atlatszo, a Hungarian news site. \nA spokesperson for BSI Public Affairs said the company did not register with the Justice Department through its Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) database because it has not yet started lobbying. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\n\u201cBSI did not register under FARA for the simple reason that it was providing only strategic advice to Hungary internally and has not (yet) represented as an agent or otherwise acted on behalf of Hungary or any of its officials, agencies or instrumentalities before the U.S. Executive Branch, Congress, any other agency of the U.S. Government, nor has BSI acted to disseminate information on Hungary\u2019s behalf to the American public,\u201d said Marc Zell, counsel for BSI. \nIn a statement provided to The Daily Beast, Sanitas said it strives to comply with FARA requirements and that the issues with its filing were because of closing out a past account. \n\u201cThis process was further delayed because Sanitas was required to update several corporate documents, which were required to file along with a new initial registration statement,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAgain, we have worked with FARA throughout this process and an explanation of the delayed filing was detailed in a cover letter filed with the initial registration statement last week. We are also in the later stages of filing an amendment to the initial filing, which details outreach made, as well as the compensation received for our efforts.\u201d \nThe statement also said that Sanitas is not a lobbying firm and did not provide \u201cany stakeholder outreach in the U.S.\u201d The firm\u2019s FARA filings, however, say it was retained to do \u201c[o]utreach to U.S. media and government officials,\u201d to foster \u201ccloser cooperation with the United States,\u201d and to strengthen ties with Western government officials. \nThe Hungarian Embassy in the U.S. did not respond to a comment request. \nHarvin has done unpaid volunteer advance work for Vice President Mike Pence when he travels. He was also a spokesperson for Trump during the transition, according to the Orlando Sentinel. \nBSI Public Affairs, meanwhile, appears to be well-connected in Israeli politics; Walla! News reported in January that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked Brot to be his spokesman. During the 2016 campaign, Brot (whose name is also sometimes transliterated to Brut or Barot) ran the Republican Party\u2019s efforts to get votes of the 300,000-odd U.S. citizens who live in Israel. According to YNetNews, Trump won three quarters of their votes. Brot is close to Israel\u2019s right-wing Likud Party, per Haaretz. \nBefore special counsel Bob Mueller\u2019s probe kicked off, firms that violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act rarely if ever faced legal action. But after Mueller charged former Trump campaign bosses Manafort and Gates with violating this law, many lobbyists scrambled to fully disclose any and all foreign-government work to the government. \nBSI doesn\u2019t appear to be among them. \nWashington\u2019s relationship with Budapest has drawn significant attention under the Trump administration. Breitbart News frequently praises Orb\u00e1n\u2019s \u201canti-globalist, conservative government,\u201d and he is arguably the continent\u2019s most powerful voice against helping migrants and refugees. Orb\u00e1n presents himself as the Trump of Central Europe, and all but endorsed Trump in the 2016 election. \nOn Thursday, Orb\u00e1n gave a speech in Budapest that blamed a stateless people group with connections to the financial industry\u2014centuries-old codewords for Jews\u2014for the country\u2019s struggles. \n\u201cWe are fighting an enemy that is different from us,\u201d he said, according to Shaun Walker of The Guardian. \u201cNot open, but hiding; not straightforward but crafty; not honest but base; does not believe in working but speculates with money; does not have its own homeland but feels it owns the whole world.\u201d\nMany human rights advocates say Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government has made the country less free. \n\u201cTo a large degree, the Hungarian government is lobbying to deflect criticism of its growing repression of dissent,\u201d said Daniel Balson of Amnesty International. \nHe said that Orb\u00e1n\u2019s criticism of billionaire financier and philanthropist George Soros has anti-Semitic overtones, that the media environment in Hungary is becoming increasingly repressive, and that Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party is looking to dramatically curtail the ability of charities and civil society organizations to help migrants fleeing violence in the Middle East. \n\u201cOn human rights, the Hungarian government has been going in the wrong direction, and through its resolute inaction on these issues, the Trump administration has really been abating its slide,\u201d Balson added. \u201cThe Hungarian government certainly wants to keep it that way and deflect any criticism of its growing human rights violations from being raised in Congress.\u201d\nAnd to do that, you need lobbyists.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/watchdogs-gops-man-in-israel-illegally-lobbied-for-anti-semite?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Michael Tomasky", "body": "Two items in Monday\u2019s news cycle show us different but complementary sides of what the Republican Party is doing to this country what Donald Trump did to Stormy Daniels, except without the bribe. Alas, they also show us why it can be so hard for Democrats and liberals to explain the truth to people.Item one is infrastructure. As you\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s \u201cInfrastructure Week.\u201d Again. The last time the White House declared it Infrastructure Week, it actually ended up being War on James Comey week. So who knows, maybe this will end up being Defend Wifebeaters Week.But for now anyway, it\u2019s Infrastructure Week. So the Trump proposal is billed as being a \u201c$1.5 trillion\u201d plan. But it\u2019s actually a $200 billion plan, in terms of commitment of federal money. The rest is supposed to come from state and local governments, which are broke, and the private sector, which will only build highways it can make money on through tolls. It\u2019s a joke. It\u2019s a joke on the American people. There\u2019s one way to finance infrastructure that\u2019s far, far better than all the others. Doesn\u2019t require this game-playing, this lying. Raise the gas tax. May I say it again? Raise the gas tax.The federal gas tax is 18.4 cents a gallon. It hasn\u2019t been raised since 1993. The raise was tucked into Bill Clinton\u2019s first budget\u2014the one, you may remember, that not a single Republican in either house of Congress voted for. It was a big budget bill, so they had many other reasons to vote against it, but the gas tax increase loomed large. When he ran for president in 1996, Bob Dole even campaigned on repealing the modest \u201993 increase.Why is the gas tax the right mechanism to fund infrastructure? Well, because it\u2019s chiefly the gas tax that fills the coffers of the Federal Highway Trust Fund, and logically enough, it\u2019s through the Federal Highway Trust Fund that we do most of our spending on highways (and bridges, and even mass transit, too). And it\u2019s broke. Broke, broke, broke.If the gas tax had been indexed to inflation in 1993, it would be 31 cents today, and we\u2019d be in far better shape. But it wasn\u2019t and we\u2019re not. And it\u2019s all pretty much one man\u2019s fault. Grover Norquist and his awful anti-tax pledge that nearly every Republican in Congress has signed makes it impossible to pass a tax increase. Republicans won\u2019t even discuss it.As it happens, Democrat Chuck Schumer last fall also came out against a gas tax increase, while speaking to my Beast colleague Sam Stein. Schumer believes infrastructure can be paid for through repatriation of tax dollars that we\u2019ve let flow overseas. Maybe. But I was chagrined to read this because, in addition to just getting the money in a clean and simple way, a gas tax increase would also help break the back of the pledge. Democratic priorities aren\u2019t going to do very well on Capitol Hill until they beat the pledge. It\u2019s been enormously destructive.But\u2014and here\u2019s why this is a tough one for Democrats politically\u2014it\u2019s hard for them to say this. I can say whatever I want. I write a column, I\u2019m not seeking votes. But those seeking votes feel they still have to be careful about being for a tax. And it\u2019s true, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m enthusiastic about asking working people to pay more at the pump. But it\u2019s been 25 years. Here\u2019s a timeline of gas tax increases. There was one 24-year interregnum, from 1959 to 1983. This one is now the longest.So while a tax increase is verboten at the federal level, what\u2019s happening instead? States are raising their gas taxes! Because they\u2019re broke, and they need to fix roads. Since 2012, more than half the states have raised gas taxes, and look at which ones: Alaska, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arizona, Texas, and Alabama are among the biggest tax hikers.Trump administration officials, interestingly, say they\u2019re open to a gas tax hike. But they say that in part because they know it\u2019ll never happen. And it\u2019s also an admission that they know their financing is a scam. If it weren\u2019t, why would they need to be open to more funding mechanisms in the first place?So that\u2019s item number one. Even if they pass something, it won\u2019t come close to doing the needed job. It\u2019s a pretend bill.

The CFPB has saved consumers trillions of dollars in various forms of usury and outright robbery. Trump named his OMB director, Mick Mulvaney, the interim head of the CFPB. Mulvaney, a former congressman, has long been on record as hating the bureau.NPR\u2019s Chris Arnold got his hands on a memo saying that the bureau will now \u201cfulfill its statutory responsibilities but go no further.\u201d It adds that the bureau should act \u201cwith humility and moderation.\u201dSo now the CFPB will stop pursuing a case against Golden Valley Lending, a notorious payday lender. Arnold\u2019s report named a Detroit woman who borrowed about $900 from Golden Valley and ended up paying the firm $3,735. In other cases it charged people as much as 950 percent interest.Question: Who could possibly be against a government agency preventing shyster companies from charging people 900 percent interest? Seriously. Who could be against that? No ideology supports that. It\u2019s criminal activity. There is no remote \u201cconservative\u201d basis for defending this. No actual, honest conservative could oppose this. But we know that someone who took $62,000 from the payday lending industry could, since Congressman Mulvaney did.But here\u2019s the kicker, and why I say it\u2019s hard to get the truth out. That Detroit woman above? She voted for Trump. \u201cTo be honest I\u2019m really mad, really pissed, because I actually voted for Trump,\u201d Julie Bonenfant says. \u201cSo knowing that his guy threw out this case that affects people like me, I feel kind of like stupid\u2014just kind of like betrayed.\u201dWell, Julie, I sympathize with your situation, I do. And I hate to say it, but you should feel a little stupid. The Republican Party is the party of payday lenders. Has been for years. It\u2019s also the party that has made actual infrastructure repair impossible\u2014again, for years. It\u2019s the party that\u2019s been blocking a minimum wage increase for years.

From there, Wolf had until this Thursday to to tell the state Supreme Court whether he approved of the map; and if he did, it would be enacted. Citing a number of nonpartisan analysts on Tuesday, however, Wolf said: \u201cLike the 2011 map, the map submitted to my office by Republican leaders is still a gerrymander. Their map clearly seeks to benefit one political party, which is the essence of why the court found the current map to be unconstitutional.\"This quick process, reshaping the heavily gerrymandered districts of Pennsylvania that had favored Republicans for years, all began on January 22. On that day, the state\u2019s Supreme Court decided that the current Republican-drawn map was unconstitutional and set in motion a multiple-week sprint to redraw all of the state\u2019s 18 districts. Republicans in the state were initially not thrilled with this new task. They appealed their own state\u2019s court ruling to the Supreme Court to try to get them to delay the mandated redrawing. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito denied the request this week without even referring it to the entirety of the court. What\u2019s more is that Joseph Scarnati, the top Republican in Pennsylvania\u2019s Senate, said he was going to refuse the court order to redraw the map. And another top Republican, Rep. Cris Dush, went as far as to say he wanted Democrats on the state\u2019s highest court to be impeached. Amid all of this chaos, Gov. Wolf remained nonplussed as he attempted to hear the input of his colleagues and citizens around the state. \u201cMy job is to figure out what a fair map is,\u201d he told The Daily Beast in an interview last week in the Harrisburg State Capitol. \u201cAnd I have a team of people including a mathematician from Tufts, mapmakers, people who will know\u2014be able to help me figure out whether as objectively as possible, this is a fair map.\u201dLast week, Wolf also toured the state to hear what his constituents would specifically want out of a new map. He described an active audience that was engaged and ready to have a redrawing that made more sense\u2014instead of districts that are not contiguous and carved into oblong shapes.\u201cPeople are fed up and very cynical about all the things that people have done over the years to manipulate our democracy,\u201d Wolf said.

We\u2019re also here to make sure that this democratic system, this system of self-government, continues to evolve, develop and get better.

In a no less dramatic live address to the nation (usually saved for instances of real war), the prime minister pleaded his innocence, claiming not only that his goal always is the \u201cfuture and security of the State of Israel\u201d and \u201cthe good of the country,\u201d but that the entire police investigation was a political witch-hunt meant to topple him.In a tactic familiar to those observing the White House, Netanyahu has thrown the integrity of the police into doubt, going so far as to call for the investigation of the investigators investigating him. In this 2017-2018 annus absurdum, life in Israel doesn\u2019t so much imitate art as it imitates Donald Trump. And yet, in the Israeli system, it\u2019s not the police that issue indictments, but the Attorney General. The police investigate, questioning witnesses and gathering evidence, after which they summarize the case and decide whether an evidentiary basis exists to move forward with an indictment. This summation is then transferred to the State Prosecutor (the body tasked with trying a criminal case) and the Attorney General. The police conclusions are therefore referred to as \u201crecommendations\u201d based on the police\u2019s judgement, and not legally binding. \u00a0Binding or not, though, what do the police conclude happened in the two major Netanyahu corruption probes?In the first, \u201cCase 1000\u201d as the police call it, Netanyahu is alleged to have received expensive gifts\u2014including high-end cigars, Champagne, and jewelry totaling 1 million shekels (nearly $300,000)\u2014from Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire James Packer. The police now allege that in return for this lavish quid, Netanyahu worked to provide financially beneficial quos \u00a0to Milchan in particular: \u00a0tax breaks possibly worth millions of dollars in total, a renewed U.S. visa, and the introduction of three other business schemes that would be helpful to Milchan.Aside from the size of the gifts, the major police revelation was arguably the tax break provision that Netanyahu pursued\u2014again, allegedly on behalf of Milchan\u2014as well as the fact that the quantity of the gift giving increased dramatically once Netanyahu took office nearly a decade ago.The second case, \u201cCase 2000,\u201d is allegedly a straight favor-trading gambit between Netanyahu and the publisher of Yediot Aharonot, a local mass-circulation daily. Recordings surfaced last year of conversations between the prime minister and the publisher negotiating better coverage for Netanyahu in return for legislation and other moves favorable to Yediot\u2019s bottom line. Here, the major police revelation was arguably that Netanyhau convened a meeting of several parliamentarians in order to move these plans forward, indicating the seriousness of his intentions\u2014not just the usual minor backroom dealings between politicians and the media. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Netanyahu, for his part, has publicly rejected the accusations, oftentimes in painstaking detail, calling the police recommendations a \u201cbiased document, extreme, riddled like Swiss cheese and doesn\u2019t hold water.\u201d Netanyahu claims that in the first case, gifts are permitted between \u201cclose family friends\u201d\u2014one lawyer advising the prime minister even called them \u201cbrothers\u201d\u2014and that he in fact \u201cworked against Milchin\u2019s interests\u201d in many of the alleged instances. In the second case, Netanyahu claims that the deal with the publisher was clearly never consummated: Yediot\u2019s fervently anti-Netanyahu editorial line remained, and Netanyahu per his interpretation called snap elections precisely in order to torpedo legislation meant to diminish the power of a rival daily (owned by yet another billionaire Netanyahu friend, Sheldon Adelson).So why does this mind-numbing minutiae matter? Because politically and legally, Netanyahu and his allies have masterfully sown doubt about the exact details of the allegations and the individual police officers making the allegations. Vast left-wing conspiracies involving the media, police, and opposition parties have been proffered, with several Likud parliamentarians calling it an \u201cattempted legal putsch\u201d against a democratically-elected government. For their past, opposition lawmakers allege, with reason, that this is precisely \u201chow criminals talk.\u201d Whether you believe one side or the other usually comes down, at bottom, to your political allegiance.Inexplicably, the police commissioner, Roni Alsheich, a mustachioed former intelligence officer, chose to waddle into this polarized swamp, giving a wide-ranging television interview last week. Alsheich stated that the police had evidence that \u201cpowerful elements\u201d had sent private investigators to gather dirt on officers involved in the Netanyahu probe. That would be like special counsel Robert Mueller allowing 60 Minutes to interview him in real-time about the ongoing Trump-Russia collusion investigation.Thank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The prime minister immediately made political hay out of Alsheich\u2019s allegations, claiming the investigators couldn\u2019t possibly be objective \u201cif they believed I acted against them.\u201d Oshri Ben-Ishai, a Tel Aviv defense attorney\u2014with experience in both organized crime and party political cases\u2014told The Daily Beast that the police commissioner had made a terrible mistake. He suggested obstruction of justice charges could even be brought against him for speaking out before the police recommendations were made public.\u201cIf the police allegations are true, it would be like if a judge trying a mob case found a grenade outside his home. How would the judge respond? It would have to impact his thinking even if he didn\u2019t know for certain it was that specific gangster,\u201d Ishai said.The smokescreens seem to be paying off for Netanyahu: the immediate danger of the police recommendations \u2013 and the premier\u2019s alleged corrupt dealings \u2013 coming to light and sparking a public outcry have not come to pass. \u00a0All of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition partners quickly closed ranks, saying they would wait patiently for Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit\u2019s decision on the cases. This could take months, with many pointing to this coming fall as the most likely timeframe. Per the Israeli judicial system, Mandelblit must now study the case; make a preliminary decision regarding an indictment; and then allow Netanyahu to present his side of the story at a hearing. Only after that does he makes his official decision.In all likelihood, Netanyahu may be safe in the short-term\u2014all it took was sacrificing the integrity of his law enforcement system and democratic norms. Indeed, he woke up this morning the only prime minister in Israel\u2019s sordid (political) history to remain in office as indictments loomed.Yet this is simply the end of the beginning of Netanyahu\u2019s legal saga, not the beginning of the end. At some point he will have to address the allegations arrayed against him by the police. Legal experts here are divided over what Mandelblit will ultimately decide to do. \u201cUnlike Ehud Olmert, there is no \u2018live money\u2019 involved here,\u201d Ben-Ishai said, referring to Netanyahu\u2019s predecessor as prime minister.

It\u2019s very dirty, but Mandelblit has to decide that it\u2019s also criminal.\u201d Legal interpretations, and hence the evidentiary details, are crucial. Are there enough witnesses to prove that the prime minister pushed for new tax laws solely because his gift-peddling friend asked him to? Were these gifts material ethical breaches and outright bribes, or simply expensive expressions of affection between two well-heeled friends? Was Netanyahu sincere in passing legislation knee-capping his patron Adelson\u2019s newspaper?The police have responded in the affirmative to all of the above\u2014and more\u2014saying outright that Netanyahu in these dealings \u201cworked against the interests of the state.\u201d It\u2019s now Mandelblit\u2019s turn to provide his own interpretation.In his address to the nation last night, a stern-looking Netanyahu spoke of his many decades \u201cfighting for Israel\u2019s security,\u201d the unending criminal investigations against him going back to the 1990, along with his current line of defense against the police allegations. \u201cAll these efforts, without exception, ended with nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis time, too, things will end with nothing.\u201dHe promised that his government would fulfill its term, and that elections would be held on time late next year. Undermining the power and confidence Netanyahu was attempting to project, every few seconds drops of precipitation fell from an unknown locale between the camera and the podium.

Wilson Rodriguez Macarreno was arrested on Thursday morning by police in Tukwila, a Seattle suburb, after calling 911 on an intruder, according to KIRO 7. Police did not arrest the intruder due to a lack of probable cause, The Seattle Times reported, but they arrested Macarreno after discovering a 14-year-old warrant issued for him by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Macarreno has been held at a nearby detention center since Thursday. Macarreno\u2019s lawyer Luis Cortes told The Daily Beast that deportation for his client, a 32-year-old father of three, is a \u201crealistic possibility,\u201d said Cortes. The carpenter fled to the United States 14 years ago to escape violence in Honduras. \u201cHis brother was shot and killed, and one of his friends was chopped up in pieces in El Salvador,\u201d Cortes claimed. In his hometown community, Macareno actively participates in church and helped increase the Spanish-speaking congregation, according to his attorney.

And despite overwhelming opposition to the policy as crafted, Congress isn\u2019t likely to send a message to the president legislatively, either.\n\u201cWe ought to push back here. I mean, who are we?\u201d Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), who is seeking to nullify the tariffs legislatively, said in an interview. \u201cI think Republicans and conservatives need to stand up and say, \u2018This is not who we are.\u2019\u201d\nTo Flake\u2019s dismay, GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have suggested that they prefer to work with the administration to narrow the policy, rather than respond legislatively. But other Republicans are warning that without substantive actions now, the administration could impose tariffs on other imports, too\u2014as Congress continues to refuse to exercise some of its most basic constitutional powers under Article I.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been worried about the fact that in a number of areas\u2026 the legislative branch has outsourced its authority, it\u2019s delegated away its power,\u201d Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), who has introduced legislation to scale back presidential authority on trade policy, said in an interview. \u201cWhether it\u2019s this president or another president in the future who will go ahead and impose other tariffs and other trade restrictions on other imports in the future.\u201d\nBut leadership isn\u2019t anxious to bring legislation to the floor, and overcoming a presidential veto would be a difficult feat\u2014especially for this Congress.\n\u201cI think the president is listening to some of the concerns that some of us have voiced,\u201d Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) told The Daily Beast. \u201cAs a practical matter, it would be a struggle to get 60 votes in the Senate, and even more so, 291 in the House. So I think it\u2019s better for us just to have constructive dialogue.\u201d\nOthers warn that stripping a president\u2019s trade authority could set a dangerous precedent. A GOP congressional source told The Daily Beast that House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) was in close contact with Trump to encourage him to narrow the policy such that Mexico and Canada would be exempt from the tariffs. And sources familiar with the tariff process expect that that the new policy would be challenged in court by companies and other entities that would be negatively impacted. These sources pointed out that such lawsuits could be successful because Trump acted under his \u201csection 232\u201d national-security authority to impose tariffs\u2014even though the stated reasons for the tariffs have nothing to do with national security.\nBut Congress\u2019 hesitance to push back more forcefully against the Trump administration on trade policy underscores a broader reluctance to exercise its constitutional powers to curtail executive authority. Despite widespread concerns among Democrats and Republicans about the president\u2019s apparent desire to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, Congress hasn\u2019t acted on legislation aimed at shielding Mueller from political interference. And both the House and Senate have failed to advance measures that would dial back Trump\u2019s war-making and surveillance powers.\n\n\u201cMembers who support free trade now risk the ire of Trump and receiving the \u2018Flake treatment.\u2019 Most conservatives will calculate that it\u2019s not worth the risk and now the pushback is dead on arrival.\u201d\n\nRepublicans weren\u2019t likely to change Trump\u2019s mind on the tariffs. For decades, Trump has espoused protectionist views on trade that would align him more with the populist left than the free-market right. And with free-trade proponent Gary Cohn exiting from his role as top economic adviser at the White House just as the new tariff policy was being crafted, GOP lawmakers weren\u2019t optimistic that they\u2019d have an ally in Cohn\u2019s replacement\u2014whomever that may be.\nLawmakers are considering at least two pieces of legislation as a response to the new tariffs. One is the Global Trade Accountability Act, a proposal authored by Lee that would require Congress to approve any trade-related policies imposed by the executive branch.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a path forward where the president would receive it well,\u201d Tillis said.\nAnother measure is being crafted by Flake, a longtime supporter of free trade who has been critical of Trump on a number of fronts\u2014even suggesting that a Republican who shares his views should challenge Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. Flake\u2019s legislation will aim to nullify the steel and aluminum tariffs altogether.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nFor many of Flake\u2019s counterparts, though, now isn\u2019t the right time to upend ongoing conversations with the administration about further narrowing the tariffs policy to include more exemptions for certain countries.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a little quick to turn to either the Flake or the Lee bill,\u201d Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO), a member of Senate Republican leadership, told The Daily Beast. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about the current trade policy, but I\u2019m not of the view that it\u2019s time yet to re-do the executive structure in that policy.\u201d\nEven some of Trump\u2019s staunchest allies on Capitol Hill are opposed to the new tariff policy, and many of them have aired their frustrations to the president directly. And while many of them would be inclined to support legislative action in response, they believe Flake isn\u2019t the right person to carry the free-trade banner\u2014not because of his longstanding views in support of free trade, but because of his opposition to Trump.\n\u201cWhat could have been a cordial disagreement over policy is now a rallying cry for Never Trumpers,\u201d a senior GOP aide told The Daily Beast. \u201cMembers who support free trade now risk the ire of Trump and receiving the \u2018Flake treatment.\u2019 Most conservatives will calculate that it\u2019s not worth the risk and now the pushback is dead on arrival. It\u2019s a shame because this is a genuine instance of where Congress should assert Article I authority.\u201d\nOne Senate Republican aide implored lawmakers to take the rare opportunity to curtail executive power over a policy that nearly everyone on Capitol Hill opposes.\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s unilateral action on tariffs is a tremendous opportunity for both parties to come together and limit executive branch power,\u201d the aide told The Daily Beast. \u201cI hope the Democrats don\u2019t waste it.\u201d\nBut Democrats on Monday didn\u2019t seem eager to join Republicans\u2019 attempts to push back against the administration based on the substance of the policy.\n\u201cI think the process the president followed to make his tariff decision and to announce it has troubled a lot of my colleagues was troubling because it was clear that it wasn\u2019t fully vetted through the different departments and the White House,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) told The Daily Beast.\nAside from their opposition to the policy itself, Republicans are concerned that the tariffs could upend the economic message they\u2019re hoping to use with voters in the upcoming midterm elections, especially on the heels of the tax-cut legislation. In particular, they worry that the tariffs could function as a tax hike on consumers at the same time that they plan on touting a booming economy.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-trade-war-swelling-but-congress-wont-act?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Margaret Carlson", "body": "An interview on Morning Joe last week of former Fox News anchor Eric Bolling inadvertently gave another startling glimpse into Trump\u2019s (in)capacity to run the country and deal with its crises. By design, the segment wasn\u2019t about Bolling\u2019s departure from the network over sexual misconduct allegations but something more tragic\u2014the death of his son from opioids later on the very day he packed up his office and left. What Bolling kept returning to in the segment was how many times Trump had called to comfort him, even having him to the White House for a visit. That\u2019s all to the good. Bolling deserves whatever help he can get in coping with his terrible loss. For the rest of us, it\u2019s one more reminder of how Trump substitutes gestures for action in solving an opioid crisis that addicts more than 2.5 million each year with deaths rising 28 percent in the past year. Nearly 175 Americans die from opioids every day. In fact, Trump hasn\u2019t just neglected the effort, he\u2019s diminished it. Opioids, like school shootings, are the moral failing of our time. We know what would work in that studies show it\u2019s not primarily economic despair driving the increase in addiction, as those who want to relieve drug makers of responsibility would have it. It\u2019s increased supply. With both drugs and guns, a solution takes standing up to powerful corporate interests, which Trump will not do. Despite promises all during the campaign and a declaration that opioids were a national health emergency a year ago, the Office of National Drug Control Policy, popularly known as the drug czar\u2019s office, has hardly been an office; nor has it had a drug czar. In fact, after Trump\u2019s dramatic pronouncement, last year he floated cutting the drug czar\u2019s office by 95 percent with the goal of eventually eliminating it altogether. That didn\u2019t fly. At least Capitol Hill believes the crisis deserves the fig leaf of having the White House behind it. That didn\u2019t stop Trump from quietly gutting it. The office\u2019s most important duties have been handed over to the Justice Department, where drugs are a matter of law enforcement, not regulating the pharmaceutical companies or helping ravaged communities in their efforts to rescue the addicted. This Monday, Trump continued his effort to remove his White House from the drug control effort with his proposal to slice the drug czar\u2019s budget from $385 million to $29 million by 2019. This proposal came two days after Trump finally got around to nominating a drug czar. It\u2019s Jim Carroll, a fine lawyer, but how he ended up being nominated tells you a lot about Trump\u2019s interest in solving a problem. Carroll currently serves as White House deputy chief of staff, a job that now-disgraced secretary Rob Porter was going to be promoted to before his alleged wife-beating was exposed. If you think the moribund drug czar\u2019s office is anything but a place for Carroll to land with dignity, you\u2019ll believe Trump\u2019s lawyer Michael Cohen\u2019s recent assertion that he personally paid a porn film star $130,000 out of the goodness of his heart. \u00a0The drug czar position under Trump began in infamy. The first nominee, former Rep. Tom Marino, was chosen by Trump for his successful effort to gut the law designed to punish pharmaceutical companies that flood drug mills with pills. 60 Minutes exposed the scandal, and Marino had no choice but to withdraw his nomination. Although it defies belief, the gutted law still stands, despite Senators Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joe Manchin from hard-hit West Virginia proposing legislation to restore the government\u2019s power. Until a few weeks ago, the drug czar\u2019s office, into year two without a permanent director, was largely being run by Taylor Weyeneth, a 24-year old campaign volunteer put into the office\u2019s number-two slot by the White House with no relevant experience other than being moved by a relative\u2019s death from a heroin overdose and having organized a golf tournament. According to an investigation by The Washington Post, he picked up the duties of eight departed administration appointees including the general counsel and chief of staff. In actuality, as described by a former staffer, Weyeneth, who inflated his resume to include a master\u2019s degree from Fordham, did little but cook up reasons to visit the West Wing, schedule meetings in attractive destinations, and, for all we know, take long walks on the beach. Coming to grips with drugs and guns aren\u2019t like the moon shot or conquering Mars, speculative and massively costly. With attention, an experienced director, and full budget, it could be done. Instead, as with so much else, Trump is empty promises and phone calls. Whether his neglect is benign or malignant, doesn\u2019t matter.

Now, he\u2019s announced his comeback in an interview with Ben Schreckinger in GQ magazine. He is, Schreckinger writes, \u201cplotting the next stage of his right-wing populist revolution\u201d which he plans to launch this spring or summer. Bannon tells him, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be focused on the promulgation of ideas, the weaponizing of ideas and building and binding together through affiliate groups.\u201d Social media will be an important component in building \u201ca 10 million man digital and analog army.\u201d \nBannon picked a rather strange venue to announce his plans. Likely, the foot soldiers he hopes to enlist have never read GQ or even heard of it. The interview must therefore be viewed as a message from Bannon to the establishments of both political parties. He claims American elites are out of touch with the people and are \u201ccomfortable with America being in decline.\u201d Now he is putting both parties on notice. He plans to recruit from Trump\u2019s right-wing base while maintaining that he supports Trump, a stance that will be important if he is to attract Trump\u2019s followers. He also plans to recruit from Bernie Sanders\u2019 left-wing flank of the Democratic Party with his appeal of economic nationalism. \nTo those who tell him that his populist nationalist movement does not have concrete policies, he points out that neither did the Tea Party in the first few years; but they were against Obamacare, observing that \u201cthere\u2019s plenty of power in just being against.\u201d On foreign policy he says we are confronted with a new \u201caxis of evil,\u201d one quite different from the one George W. Bush laid out in his first term. \nThe threat to the United States, and the entire West, according to Bannon, is coming from China, Iran (which he calls by its old name, Persia), and Turkey. That axis, he argues, is \u201cconfronting the Christian West\u201d and resembles the period in the 1930s before the start of World War II. In that era, FDR had to break the isolationist mood of the country to take on the threat from Germany and its allies which of course he never really succeeded in doing until Pearl Harbor. \nAs for Putin\u2019s Russia, Bannon acknowledges that \u201cthe Russians are bad guys.\u201d Nevertheless, given the threat from the axis, he believes that the United States must \u201creset the relationship with Russia\u2026 and end the Cold War.\u201d He thinks Donald Trump gets this, but most of the other political forces don\u2019t. His stance on the Russian issue seems a throwback to the policy of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and it puts Bannon in line with the views of pro-Russian analysts like Stephen Cohen and others writing for The Nation magazine, as well as Trump followers who buy Bannon\u2019s thesis on the Russian issue. \n\n\u201cIt is rather fanciful for Bannon to assume he will get the support of leftists simply because they have one economic goal in common.\u201d\n\nCohen has appeared many times on Tucker Carlson\u2019s Fox News program, where in terms similar to Bannon, he argues against a \u201cCold War\u201d stance by the United States and urges friendship with the Putin regime. While the editors of America\u2019s premier left-wing opinion magazine stand among those who hate Trump, their obstinate stand on the Russian issue could apparently lead them to giving support to Bannon on this foreign policy position. \nI would not be surprised if he gains the support of Russophiles like the hard-right congressman from California, Dana Rohrabacher. The Putin government is so enamored of the congressman that he evidently received a code name from the Russian spy agencies, whose leaders saw him as an intelligence source. A supporter of Trump, who now may well be critical of some of Trump\u2019s new anti-Russian moves like giving arms to Ukraine, Rohrabacher would be ready and more than willing to join forces with Bannon. \nIt is on domestic policy that Bannon\u2019s approach becomes quite interesting. While his foreign policy is in line with an \u201cAmerica First\u201d position and is clearly nationalist, on domestic policy Bannon lines up with many on the left, whose support he hopes will shift to the new movement that he intends to build. Remember that at the time of the announcement of the tax cut introduced by Trump, Bannon argued for a much higher tax on the rich and bemoaned the fact that the bill was negligent in that regard. \nBannon believes that on economic issues, Sanders and many self-proclaimed socialists are \u201ceconomic nationalists.\u201d They favor tough negotiations to get trade deals that benefit the American worker as well as protectionist tariffs that protect goods made in the United States, and hence the jobs of American workers. Bannon in the interview does not address the problem that the foreign powers we\u2019re dealing with could institute their own retaliatory tariffs, leading to a trade war that will drive prices up in the United States and produce serious negative repercussions, as many are predicting right now in the wake of Trump\u2019s announcement about steel and aluminum. \nBannon has not repudiated his friendly relations with those in Europe he sees as allies for a new movement, especially like Marine Le Pen and the National Front in France, which many have described as a \u201ccrypto-fascist\u201d party. Le Pen, like Bannon, believes that Islam is at war with the West, and like American nationalists, is against open borders, for immigration restriction, and especially banning further immigration from Muslim nations that harbor many jihadists. \nShe is also pro-Putin and for reconciliation with Russia. Putin\u2019s government was openly funding her last run for the French presidency, and she is sympathetic with his authoritarian bent and his repressive stance toward those who favor the creation of a democracy in Russia. \nIn France, Le Pen ran her campaign to the left of the French Communist Party on many domestic matters, calling for more welfare state spending and defending herself as a protector of working people who are losing all because of \u201cwild and anarchic globalization.\u201d She favors the reindustrialization of France, and pulling out of the Eurozone. Reports indicate that many French Communists voted for her and support her party and its programs. In many ways, Bannon\u2019s respect for and his outreach to the left is similar. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s election became an inspiration to the new hard-right European parties. Le Pen was ecstatic about his victory, and her claim that she would \u201ctake back France\u201d is her version of Trump and Bannon\u2019s goal for America. Trump also favors France leaving the EU, which is a common nationalist demand. And of course, the Brexit victory in Great Britain was the fulfillment of the goal of one of their main allies, Nigel Farage.\nBannon said in one of his interviews with the journalist Joshua Green in his book that Trump\u2019s rise was one manifestation of a new powerful global undercurrent. \u201cThat\u2019s why,\u201d he explained, \u201cyou see a nationalist movement\u2026 Look at Le Pen in France, Orban in Hungary, and the nationalists in Poland.\u201d\nThat is why he sees Orban and others as potential allies, even though in Hungary, Orban boasts about creating a new \u201cilliberal democracy.\u201d Orban sounded much like Bannon when he explained in a July 2014 speech that the \u201cnew state that we are constructing in Hungary is an illiberal state, a non-liberal state. It does not reject the fundamental principles of liberalism such as freedom\u2026 but it does not make this ideology the central element of state organization, but instead includes a different, special, national approach.\u201d \nSimilarly, Bannon is much in line with the new authoritarian government of Poland, where the Law and Justice Party supports the type of protectionist policies that were once the domain of the left, and where the government has moved to curtail the opposition press and to tear down an independent judiciary. All these measures echo Donald Trump\u2019s many statements that he sees the same enemies at home and wishes he could accomplish in the U.S. what Poland and Hungary have in Europe.\nBannon, who always presents himself as anti-Wall Street, although he made his fortune working at Goldman Sachs, argues that he and his new movement will represent working people. \u201cThe greatest power on earth,\u201d he tells his interviewer, \u201cis the working men and women of this country. They have a nobility to them. They have a certain power to them.\u201d When Schreckinger observes accurately that his statement \u201creminds me of Woody Guthrie,\u201d the ironies are many. \nIn a recently discovered song, Guthrie wrote a ballad against Trump\u2019s father Fred, titled \u201cOld Man Trump.\u201d His song protests the racial restrictions on properties held by his company in the 1950s, for which he and his son Donald were both sued by the Justice Department in the 1970s. Guthrie, who lived for two years in the Trump property known as Beach Haven, wrote the following:\nBeach Haven is Trump\u2019s Tower\nWhere no black folks come to roam,\nNo, no, Old Man Trump!\nOld Beach Haven ain\u2019t my home!\n\n\n\nAnd of course, Guthrie was a Communist. Yet Bannon says that although people say that \u201cThis Land is Your Land\u201d is a communist song, the \u201cpopulist left have taken it, but it\u2019s still one of the most powerful songs written in this country. So I\u2019m a big fan.\u201d Somehow, I don\u2019t think were he alive, Woody Guthrie would be pleased to hear Steve Bannon\u2019s praises. \nLet us not forget, however, that during the years of World War II, Communists endorsed the strategy of becoming a pressure group on FDR\u2019s administration, hoping to push it to the left. Bannon\u2019s obvious hope is that a movement he forms will have the same effect on whatever conservative administration is in power, especially the current Trump one. It is also rather fanciful for Bannon to assume he will get the support of leftists simply because they have one economic goal in common. The left will never support a movement that sees itself as ethno-nationalist and which the left already perceives as racist. \nNor is it certain that he will get the backing of the white working-class voters in swing states that put Trump in power. If he does succeed in getting some of them to join him, others will stay where they are or even vote for someone like Sanders. Many will already be disillusioned with Trump, and Bannon cannot count on their votes. As J.D. Vance put it about Trump before the election, Trump was selling \u201csnake oil\u201d to them, and the same will be said about Bannon. It could also split the GOP and conservative vote, thereby assuring Democratic Party wins. The future for Bannon\u2019s movement is therefore problematic.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/steve-bannon-thinks-lefties-will-join-his-xenophobic-crusade?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "John Stoehr", "body": "I suppose Bernie Sanders believes he's accomplished something in not endorsing Senator Dianne Feinstein for a fifth and final term. At this point, however, we should be doubtful the Vermont independent can achieve more than political gesture. \nIt\u2019s true that today\u2019s Senate is among the oldest in the nation's history and probably does not reflect the viewpoints of younger Americans as it might if it were less geriatric (a caucus that could include, some might argue, Sanders himself). But is that good reason to unseat an 84-year-old incumbent seeking her final term?\nActivists aimed to accomplish one thing at the California Democratic Party\u2019s convention last month. They\u00a0denied\u00a0Feinstein, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, their party\u2019s endorsement. Oh, and they booed a lot. Otherwise, Feinstein is a four-term senator from California in the era of Donald Trump.\nWill she be primaried? Yes. In California, everyone competes with everyone in primaries regardless of party. Will she win? Almost certainly. Along with the jungle party, Feinstein has another built-in advantage: being a Democrat in a midterm year that\u2019s a referendum on a Republican president. \nStill another advantage is that she\u2019s lead to charge to reinstate the ban on assault weapons, and she\u2019s hammering the president for kowtowing to the gun lobby\u2014especially important in a year when it seems that this issue might actually cut in the Democrats\u2019 favor.\n\n\u201cIf certain Democrats who\u2019ve been inside the system for a while seem corrupt, there\u2019s probably a good reason for that.\u201d\n\nI get that her senior status is an issue, but seriously, the only instrument of direct power a senator has is her vote. As long as she can vote in accordance with her constituency, and mostly in line with her party's priorities, Feinstein\u2019s advanced age is nary an impediment. Hell, Strom Thurmond was a century old when he retired. As long as his aides could\u00a0wheel him onto the Senate floor\u00a0to vote along party lines, his age was pragmatically moot.\nWhy is Feinstein\u2019s age being\u00a0held up\u00a0as an issue? Because activists will take any excuse to whack her. Feinstein has never been popular with the party's grassroots. She favored capital punishment when they were against it. She supported the Iraq War when they were against it. For these and other political sins, Feinstein is seen as a relic of another age when the Democrats were a truly centrist party (think Bill Clinton) rather than the center-left party it is today.\nThat activists are targeting Feinstein is worrisome\u2014for progressive politics. It suggests the base, as it functions in California, will accept gesture in lieu of power, an outcome of the Sanders campaign that does not receive the scrutiny it deserves. \nIt\u2019s one thing to blast a sitting senator as insufficiently loyal to progressive causes. It\u2019s another to accomplish something for having done that. If all you've done is deny an incumbent an endorsement, you haven\u2019t done much. If denying an endorsement results in defeat, what then? A Democrat beat a Democrat, and nothing has changed. \nWhat happened in California illustrates my frustration with a left in thrall to the \u201cSanders Revolution.\u201d It believes it\u2019s radical, but really, it\u2019s not radical enough to do what needs to be done. It should establish a channel of communication with Feinstein and find common areas where it can push like hell. Instead, it attacks her, thus marginalizing the left, thus fueling soaring levels of resentment, thus giving people like California State Senate leader Kevin de Le\u00f3n ample fodder for exploitation.\nWhat\u2019s the point of politics? It shouldn\u2019t be ideological purity. It should be \u201cmaximizing human freedom.\u201d That\u2019s how the radical\u2019s radical, Saul Alinsky, put it. The question, then, is what\u2019s needed to do that. In part, it would be keeping a shoo-in like Feinstein in place in the Senate while attacking vulnerable Republicans\u2014all in the interest of acquiring the power needed to effect change.\nDoing that will dirty your hands. That\u2019s inevitable. But that should not be an impediment to doing what\u2019s needed. Guess whose hands are dirty? Dianne Feinstein voted with her party to increase Pentagon spending\u2014a no-no for most leftists\u2014in exchange for billions in relief funding for Puerto Rico and other disaster areas. Democrats got billions for children\u2019s health, too. Feinstein did something \u201cbad\u201d to achieve something good. Activists should understand that.

Crack open the champagne, pat yourselves on the back, and welcome Conor Lamb, the apparent winner of the latest special election, to Washington with open arms. \nBut then sober up, for you may not see his likes again. Democrats say there are many Conor Lambs out there. Honk if you\u2019re a Democrat who\u2019s served in the military, holds a respectable job and has an all-American family who\u2019s not been recruited to run. \u00a0\n It\u2019s just that not every candidate with the right resume is a best-in-show candidate as Lamb was, a prosecutor who put drug dealers in jail in a place where opioids are killing family and neighbors, and didn\u2019t talk like an Ivy Leaguer. Most candidates can\u2019t pull off being Mr. Potato Head, loose parts plugged in to make him look palatable to a divergent electorate: a Democrat against abortion, at home firing an AR-15 when 17 children were just slain at school in Parkland, and comfortable throwing shade on his party\u2019s leader Nancy Pelosi in the midst of resurgent women\u2019s movement led by #MeToo. \nThat and a decent economic message that neutralized the tax bill is what it took to do well not just in Allegheny County outside Pittsburgh but in blood-red Westmoreland and Washington counties. This is not to say Democrats shouldn\u2019t go right or won\u2019t be able to without losing their souls. Certainly being in the minority erodes your soul and steps must be taken. But not everyone is as smooth as Lamb, not every election is special, and not every opponent as weak as Rick Saccone, although he wasn\u2019t as lame as his party would have you believe.\nPennsylvania\u2019s 18th congressional district may be conservative but we now see a \u00a0limit in such places for Trump-style chaos. I\u2019m from Harrisburg in the swath of the state called Alabama, where we like our coffee burnt, our funnel cakes coated in sugar, and remember the 50\u2019s fondly. Generally, a candidate as dull as Saccone would go down easily. \nBut Trump, who\u2019s not delivered much to them but chaos, was on the ballot, despite Lamb trying to downplay that in his victory lap Wednesday. Trump is so unhinged right now that a rally meant to help Saccone was so full of self-involved ranting and rambling it likely hurt more than it helped. The president is \u00a0in a particularly unhinged phase. Driving to the polls, voters were treated to coverage of the firing of the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, which could have only been handled more poorly if chief of staff John Kelly hadn\u2019t kept the president from doing it while his top diplomat was on foreign soil trying to patch up the president\u2019s s-hole remarks about Africa. \nHe not only took out his admittedly weak secretary but did so in a coward\u2019s way by twitter, relishing the cruelty, like the bully on the playground who punches you where you are already bruised. Pre-Trump winning CD-18 by 20 points, those voters agreed with Tillerson on the merits: that there\u2019s a lot of work to be done to make Trump\u2019s impulsive decision to meet with Kim Jong-Un have a chance of bearing fruit and that going soft on Russia is a fool\u2019s game that may have emboldened Vladimir Putin to poison two former spies sitting on a bench in London with nerve gas. \nAs Tillerson was taking deep gulps in an emotional farewell press conference, Trump was promising yet more firings. There should be\u2014Trump chose losers he\u2019s tired of with good reason, in particular those who make headlines flying around on what look like vacations and first class ones to boot. \nBut Trump revulsion is not a given among voters like those in PA-18. True, we can be fairly certain he\u2019s going to keep up the behavior the parent of a high school sophomore wouldn\u2019t tolerate. The president can rise five points in the polls by merely reading a State of the Union speech off the teleprompter, hiring a Marine general to run the place, and getting rid of the disheveled, angry Steve Bannon. The bar is so low, we\u2019ve grown accustomed to so much, it doesn\u2019t take much for relief from the turmoil to provide a bump. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMuch of the energy among Democrats lies not with the Lamb model but with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren wing, who play well on the coasts but not far inland. The tent has to grow to win but not so big it collapses under the weight of bolted-together, focus-grouped candidates. \nIn some ways, Lamb is a novelty act, given a one-time pass to talk trash about Nancy Pelosi. The press noted it but didn\u2019t pound away every day. As is often the case, there was unconscious rooting not for the candidate but the story, an upset by an underdog that might signal a blue wave. So Lamb got away with it.\nBut for others, taking a swipe at the most powerful Democratic woman in the country might lose the growing bloc of female voters 30 and up who can pull Democrats across the finish line in close races. Hugging an AR-15 to neutralize the NRA while holding on to those who think it\u2019s ludicrous that any teenager can buy a weapon of mass destruction is a stunt that shouldn\u2019t be tried again.

Using F-15s, F-22s, AC-130 gunships, Apache helicopters, MQ-9 unmanned drones, and artillery, U.S. forces killed an estimated 100 attackers, according to some Russian media reports, and destroyed numerous tanks and artillery pieces. Among the reported fatalities, according to a Pentagon official, were Syrian Arab Army soldiers enlisted in the \u201cISIS Hunters\u201d unit, as well as Russian mercenaries working for Wagner, a private military company under the command-and-control of the Russian Ministry of Defense that has been tasked with re-taking oilfields from ISIS.Initially, Moscow denied any connection. \u201cThe reason for the incident were [sic] reconnaissance and search activities by Syrian militia not coordinate with the command of the Russian operations group,\u201d Interfax cited the Russian defense ministry as saying. But much like the Kremlin\u2019s denial of Russian army soldiers or special operators being deployed in Ukraine, this narrative is rapidly eroding against a tide of social media and even pro-Kremlin press claims naming the names of the slain mercenaries and giving details of their funerals in St. Petersburg. If confirmed, this would be first time that U.S. forces directly engaging and killing Russian combatants in Syria, albeit not the first time that CIA-armed forces have done so, as The Daily Beast has previously reported.Additionally, the scuttlebutt among Russian adventurers has swirled with information of those killed and wounded in battle. The problem is that many of the claims being made offer wildly different casualty figures.Curiously, the story of the Wagner losses has not appeared at all on Fontanka, the independent St. Petersburg website that first broke the story of the private military company\u2019s deployment to Syria in 2013. (After Fontanka journalist Denis Korotokov published a series of articles on Wagner in 2017, he was accused on anonymous websites of \u201cbetraying the motherland,\u201d having ties with ISIS, and helping Ukrainian intelligence. Then he began to get violent threats.) Independent war bloggers such as Necro_mancer66 on Twitter and the Conflict Intelligence Team, which usually report on war deaths in Syria unacknowledged by the Russian defense ministry, have been only cautiously reporting individual deaths they have found on social media. (They\u2019re so far up to six.) This time, the story is being promoted largely by pro-Kremlin Russian nationalists, which should make us slightly wary of what conclusions to draw.For instance, Igor Girkin, known by his nom de guerre of Col. Igor Strelkov, a former Russian intelligence operative who commanded separatist forces in east Ukraine before he was sidelined by rivals, took to the social-media platform Vkontakte to claim that no regular Russian forces were in the area, but that \u201c2 tactical divisions of Wagner\u201d \u201cwere hit by strikes from American aviation. One is practically totally destroyed, and the second is smashed 'to smithereens.\u2019\u201d Strelkov, who is based in Moscow, estimated that as many as \u201c100\u201d Wagner mercenaries were killed. And while he once inadvertently furnished the first real evidence that pro-Russian separatists downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in 2014, after they mistook the commercial airliner for a Ukrainian military cargo plane, he cannot be counted as a credible source.For that reason, we suspect that the Vzglyad article is disinformation meant to embarrass the Russian government for failing to defend its assets in the field, if not cajole it into retaliating against the U.S. Privately owned pro-Kremlin news site Vzglyad, produced by top pro-Kremlin social-media propagandist Konstantin Rykov has published purportedly decoded Russian mercenaries chatting with one another from voice tapes that appeared on the Russian-language Telegram channel \u201cWarGonzo\u201d shortly after the firefight with the SDF and U.S. warplanes. Four distinct voices put the total number of mercenaries dead at well over 200, although even they disagree as to the exact figures and details; with some arguing that entire companies were \u201cdestroyed,\u201d and that American flags were draped over the vanquished Russian trenches, which would certainly incite an incensed reaction back in Russia. For that reason, we suspect that the Vzglyad article is disinformation meant to embarrass the Russian government for failing to defend its assets in the field, if not cajole it into retaliating against the U.S. Today, Bloomberg News appeared to corroborate the Vzglyad allegations, reporting that \u201c[m]ore than 200 mercenaries, mostly Russians\u201d were killed in the episode, citing an unnamed U.S. official and \u201cthree Russians familiar with the matter.\u201dThus far, Moscow has not even acknowledged a single loss, much less responded in kind to the U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition. Instead, a Russian defense official couched the official response in more broadly anti-American terms: that the attack \u201ddemonstrated that the true goal of continuation of the unlawful presence of USA forces on Syrian territory is not a battle with the international terrorist group ISIS, but a capture and hold of economic assets under its control that belong only to the Syrian Arab Republic.\u201d Thank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.When pressed on reported Wagner casualties in the Syrian desert, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov answered: \u201cThese reports require verification.\u201d He also said, \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, there is a fair amount of our compatriots in various countries across the world.\u201dOfficially, private military companies are illegal in Russia. But you wouldn\u2019t know it if you listened to Vladimir Putin. In April 2012, Putin voiced his interest in PMCs\u2014known as Chastnye Voenniye Companiye (ChVK)\u2014and their potential utility as \u201can instrument in the pursuit of national interests without the direct participation of the state,\u201d continuing, \u201cI believe that it should be considered, thought over.\u201d Despite his support, and some efforts in the State Duma to draft legislation in support of the mercenaries, PMCs remain outlawed, leaving them in a precarious position and dependent upon their utility to the Russian state. PMCs have the same attraction to Putin that all proxies, mercenaries, or contractors have to all states: deniability and low-cost. They are expendable, easily written off as patriotic \u201cvolunteers\u201d and not state actors, whose demise needn\u2019t be counted as wartime losses, and whose possibly lethal behavior lowers the risk of escalation with the enemy. Dead mercenaries avoid the unwanted press and attention that comes with young army conscripts returning home in zinc-lined coffins. The very first deployment of Russian PMCs in Syria was more Keystone Kops than Spetsnaz. First appearing in 2013, the Slavonic Corps was formed as an offshoot of the Hong Kong-based Moran Security Group. From the get-go, their intervention was marked by confusion, poor coordination, and aged equipment. First tasked with seizing back regime oil fields, the Slavonic Corps\u2019 mission quickly turned into a rout as they were outmatched in both numbers and equipment by anti-Assad opposition forces. The embarrassment did not end there. On their return to Russia, the ex-members of the Slavonic Corps were arrested by the FSB, Russia\u2019s domestic intelligence service, and most were charged with violating Article 348 of the Russian Criminal Code, banning mercenary service. And yet, while Russia\u2019s first use of PMCs was less than an unalloyed victory, the Kremlin\u2019s appetite for soldiers of fortune has only increased in the years since. The next opportunity came with the conflict in Ukraine, and Russia\u2019s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and incitement of rebellion in the Donbas. The use of proxies and PMCs came to form a central component of Russia\u2019s \u201chybrid war\u201d strategy. In order to support Russia\u2019s activities in Ukraine, a veteran of the Slavonic Corps and former Spetsnaz officer was chosen. Lt. Col. Dmitry Utkin, who until 2013 was an officer in the 2nd Spetsnaz Brigade of Russian military intelligence (GRU), called this new group \u201cWagner\u201d in honor of Hitler\u2019s favorite composer. Apparently, in addition to being a veteran of both the Slavonic Corps and Spetsnaz, Utkin has an affinity for the \u201caesthetics and ideology of the Third Reich,\u201d making him not just a neo-Nazi but that oh-so-perfect embodiment of Putinist disinformation efforts: a combatant ostensibly deployed into a neighboring country to stop a \u201cfascist junta,\u201d as the Kremlin routinely called the government in Kiev, from exterminating ethnic Russians.However, this outing turned out to be far more favorable than the maiden foray into Syria. Among the mixture of rogues, Mafiosi, and killers that made up Russia\u2019s rebel army in Eastern Ukraine, Utkin and Wagner provided Russia with a competent and loyal unit able to do its bidding (including, reportedly, eliminating those more feral rebel commanders who had outlived their usefulness). A crucial feature of Russia\u2019s support of the Assad regime has been to stabilize it. Spetsnaz advisers provide crucial reconnaissance to Russia\u2019s air contingent and support Syrian government offensives. Russian officers help organize, train, and deploy the various militias that make up most of the regime\u2019s fighting force, along with advising the regime\u2019s larger military and strategic planning. For the most part, Russia has been successful in avoiding getting its \u201cofficial\u201d forces sucked into direct ground combat. Getting directly involved in on-the-ground fighting would damage the Kremlin\u2019s narrative that they are there as \u201cpeacekeepers\u201d and, recently, that the combat portion of their mission has ended. But Syrian forces are unable on their own to obtain key objectives that are crucial to sustain the Assad regime, and the narrative that they are fighting\u2014and winning\u2014the war against ISIS. To get around these issues, Russia has turned to Wagner. Crucial in the offensive to retake Palmyra, Wagner and its Russian mercenaries have become an even more important element of Russia\u2019s efforts in Syria. They allow Russia to deploy capable and professional forces who have the experience and training to seize strategic objectives without the potential blowback of casualties. Mercenaries receive no state funeral and are not officially reported, allowing Russia to maintain the fa\u00e7ade of winding down its involvement.As Assad\u2019s position has solidified, Russia\u2019s focus has centered around regaining assets that will enable the regime to economically support itself\u2014and pay for the continued supplies and weaponry. According to documents seen by the AP and Fontaka, Evro Polis has signed a contract with Syria\u2019s state-owned General Petroleum Corp. for 25 percent of the proceeds from all the oil and natural-gas fields it captures from ISIS. Peskov\u2019s \u201ccompatriots\u201d around the world should all be so lucky.While at first the agreement seems similar to other resource rights for mercenary deals of the past, the ownership and structure of Evro Polis gives even greater insight into the workings and connections between economics, favors, and power in Russia. Evro Polis is reportedly Wagner\u2019s commercial front in Syria. It is owned by Putin\u2019s \u201cfavorite chef\u201d Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose companies have extensive contracts to provide food for everyone from the Russian defense ministry to most of Moscow\u2019s public schools. Most famously, Prigozhin set up a \u201cKremlin troll factory\u201d in St. Petersburg to influence public opinion in the West by peddling conspiracy theories and disinformation on social-media platforms.Not simply an agreement to incentivize Wagner\u2019s continued involvement in Syria, the Evro-General Petroleum deal is also an incentive for keeping mercenaries on board for future Russian adventures abroad. And given the tensions between Moscow and Damascus owing to latter\u2019s reliance on Russian loans and oil shipments to keep the lights on and the Syrian war machine humming, the Kremlin has every reason to coax its team of expendables into helping Assad regain control of more of his captured hydrocarbon industry, be it from ISIS or an emerging U.S. protectorate in eastern Syria, which has shown every intention of not handing major oil fields back to the regime.For this reason, last week\u2019s events seem more a prelude than an anomaly in what has been a war of proliferating sideshow conflicts. So long as Putin has Wagner to provoke or skirmish against the Syrian Democratic Forces, he can attack U.S. allies without formally attacking them and risk retaliation from the Pentagon, while insisting that the Russian military was nowhere near the scene of the crime.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/did-the-us-really-kill-200-russians-in-syriaor-just-a-few?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Spencer Ackerman", "body": "Republicans on the House intelligence committee investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election have refused Democratic entreaties to subpoena Twitter for direct messages of Donald Trump associates, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell The Daily Beast. \nSources would not share with The Daily Beast specifically whose DMs committee Democrats wanted to subpoena Twitter to acquire.

Trump\u2019s associates tend to share their boss\u2019s love for Twitter and, like many users of the social network, have been known to use direct messaging for sensitive communications.\nAnd it comes as frustrated Democrats are accusing their Republican colleagues behind closed doors of intransigence that leaves them in a precarious position for any investigation: being asked to trust witnesses without the tools to verify their stories. \n\u201cFor months, we have repeatedly requested that the Committee subpoena Twitter for communications between numerous persons of interest in our investigation,\u201d Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the committee, confirmed to The Daily Beast. \n\u201cA complete investigation would subpoena relevant communications records\u2014including Twitter messages\u2014to corroborate or contradict witness testimony,\u201d added Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat on the committee and a former prosecutor.\n\u201cThe GOP has been unwilling to do that. If we don\u2019t do that, we are conducting a take-them-at-their-word investigation. There are too many Trump team members who are not worthy of being taken at their word.\u201d \nDemocrats who want to subpoena Twitter for the private messages of Trumpworld figures are operating on the theory that the communications would either reveal substantive discussion of election machinations tied to Russia or vindicate the denials of actual and potential Trump-camp witnesses. But the Republicans have sat on the requests instead of fulfilling them or denying them outright.  \nRepresentatives for committee chairman Devin Nunes and Russia investigation chief Mike Conaway did not reply to a request for comment. \n\n\u201cWe are conducting a take-them-at-their-word investigation. There are too many Trump team members who are not worthy of being taken at their word.\u201d\n\u2014 Rep. Eric Swalwell\n\nDemocrats are getting restless. They\u2019ve urged in committee hearings dominated by Nunes\u2019 accusations of surveillance malfeasance that the Republicans are blocking access to witness documentation, including travel records and communications logs. The DMs fall in that category. \nTwitter, for its part, has pledged to cooperate with both the House and Senate Russia inquiries and Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s unfolding inquiry. But the company has said a lot less about how it cooperates. Turning over a user\u2019s DMs without being lawfully compelled to do so would spark serious questions about how the company treats user privacy with implications far beyond the Russia probe. \n\u201cTwitter continues to work with the Special Counsel\u2019s Office and with Congress throughout their investigations, providing relevant information and cooperating through appropriate law enforcement channels,\u201d the company said in a Friday statement. \nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\n\nThere has been an exception to the committee\u2019s inability to get DMs from relevant Twitter users: Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s exchanges with WikiLeaks, \u00a0which were published in part by The Atlantic in November. In the published DMs, WikiLeaks nudges the younger Trump toward its 2016 publication of Democratic emails that U.S. intelligence assesses Russia hacked, and even suggests that Trump refuse to concede the election if he lost. Congress acquired those messages not from Twitter, but from the younger Trump\u2019s attorneys \u2013 raising questions about how complete the Trump Jr.-WikiLeaks colloquy actually is. \nOn February 5, the committee met to consider the release of the Democratic rebuttal to Nunes\u2019 accusations against the FBI and Justice Department. But the transcript revealed a deep Democratic frustration over the committee\u2019s inability to access all sorts of relevant documentation. \nFor example: Peter King, a Long Island Republican, referenced not \u201csee[ing] anything at all\u201d to contradict the Trump attorney Michael Cohen\u2019s insistence that Cohen never met in Prague in August 2016 with a Russian official. \nSchiff, the senior Democrat on the panel, replied in the meeting: \u201cWhat we have not had the opportunity to do is determine whether he was telling us the truth, because we have made requests to get documents, the subpoenaed documents, and the majority has been unwilling to support those requests to subpoena documents. When that is the case, then we have no way of verifying or disproving information.\u201d \nAmong the information Schiff said the GOPers had declined steps to acquire are subpoena requests for unspecified Trump Jr. documents and unspecified Deutsche Bank records. (Trump is approximately $360 million in debt to Deutsche Bank, which faces accusations of acting as a vehicle for Russian money laundering, and there are disputed reports that Mueller has served subpoenas on the bank.) \n\u201cNumerous times, we have asked for documents, we have requested to subpoena documents from Twitter when we know there were direct communication between Don Jr. and Twitter, and Roger Stone and Twitter. These requests have gone nowhere with [the] majority,\u201d the February 5 meeting transcript records Schiff saying. \n\n\u201cWe have requested to subpoena documents from Twitter when we know there were direct communication between Don Jr. and Twitter, and Roger Stone and Twitter. These requests have gone nowhere.\u201d\n\u2014 Rep. Adam Schiff\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Don Jr. who was prone to DMing about the election. Stone, in August and September 2016, DM\u2019d with the Russian cutout Guccifer2.0, an intermediary that claimed to provide the DNC material to WikiLeaks. Stone has also claimed to have a backchannel to WikiLeaks, which would explain his prescient fall 2016 predictions about material damaging to Democrats the group would publish. But it\u2019s not clear if that backchannel, said to be radio host Randy Credico, is genuine, and WikiLeaks has denied it. \nNunes, the committee chairman, has wide-ranging authority for subpoenas under the committee bylaws. (PDF) He hasn\u2019t seen fit to subpoena Twitter for the DMs, but has subpoenaed Fusion GPS, the political research consultancy that sponsored ex-British spy Christopher Steele\u2019s dossier. That followed on an August subpoena (PDF) to the FBI and Justice Department for documentation surrounding their \u201crelationship\u201d to Steele and the dossier. More recently, Nunes has announced unilateral plans to investigate Trump investigators and members of the Obama administration, either at the current Justice Department or the State Department under John Kerry.\n\u201cThe committee\u2019s rules provide that only the chairman can authorize a subpoena, and a serious investigation requires that the committee not simply take witnesses\u2019 word at face value, but verify their testimony when possible through communication records obtained from third parties,\u201d Schiff told The Daily Beast. \n\u201cAnd while that power has been used freely against government officials and Fusion GPS, for the purposes of the Russia investigation this vital investigative power has been foreclosed.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Andrew Desiderio", "body": "The Trump administration on Thursday approved a massive new weapons sale to Ukraine, as that country continues to defend itself against Russian-backed separatists.\nThe decision represents a show of force against Russian President Vladimir Putin, as the United States and its allies continue to accuse Moscow of destabilizing eastern Europe and the Middle East through the use of military incursions and cyber warfare.\nThe $47 million sale includes 210 Javelin anti-tank missiles and 37 launch units, the State Department said, and it comes less than three months after the administration approved a similar lethal defensive weapons sale.\n\u201cThis proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by improving the security of Ukraine,\u201d the department said. \u201cThe Javelin system will help Ukraine build its long-term defense capacity to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity in order to meet its national defense requirements.\u201d\nCongress has 30 days to nix the sale, but lawmakers from both parties have been supportive of such measures in the past and are unlikely to block it. Republicans, in particular, have praised the administration for approving weapons sales to Ukraine in the past, and have pointed to those actions to rebut criticisms that the Trump administration hasn\u2019t been tough enough on Russia\u2014particularly when it comes to mandatory sanctions against Moscow, many of which have not yet been implemented as required by law.\nDemocrats have derided President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson over the non-implementation of new sanctions against Russia that Congress passed overwhelmingly last year. But when it comes to providing military assistance to Ukraine and sanctioning alleged Russian human-rights abusers, they\u2019ve praised Trump and other top officials.\nThursday\u2019s announcement runs counter to a controversial change that was made to the Republican party platform in 2016. The Daily Beast reported at the time that top Trump campaign officials tried to soften language in the party\u2019s official platform about military aid to Ukraine in order to make it more Russia-friendly. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who has been indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller, used to work for Ukraine\u2019s pro-Kremlin president, Viktor Yanukovych. In December, a GOP delegate said Trump himself was directly involved in the platform change.\nRep. Mac Thornberry (R-TX), the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told The Daily Beast on Wednesday that the administration should be doing more to ensure that Moscow pays a price\u2014including the full implementation of those congressionally mandated sanctions. Still, Thornberry said Thursday, Trump\u2019s team is doing more to counter Russian aggression than the Obama administration.\n\u201cBy renewing strategies to confront Russia in the National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy, agreeing to help arm Ukraine and restoring America\u2019s military strength, the Trump administration is taking important steps to turn that trend around, but much more needs to be done,\u201d Thornberry said in a statement.\nThe timing of Thursday\u2019s weapons announcement likely wasn\u2019t lost on top administration officials. It came on the same day that Putin revealed that Russia has successfully developed \u201cinvincible\u201d nuclear weapons that can \u201creach anywhere in the world.\u201d", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-administration-approves-new-weapons-sale-to-ukraine-bucking-putin?source=articles_sum&via=rss", "source": "Daily Beast", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}]
