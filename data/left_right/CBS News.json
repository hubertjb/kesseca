[{"author": "Kathryn Watson", "body": "About a year ago, President Trump pledged to eliminate the national debt \"over a period of eight years.\" But for the first time in history, the national debt surpassed $21 trillion this week, according to the U.S. Treasury.\n\nThe landmark comes shortly after Congress passed, and Mr. Trump signed, a suspension on the federal debt limit last month, allowing the government to borrow an unlimited amount of money until March 1, 2019.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20, 2017, the national debt was $19.9 trillion, according to U.S. Treasury data. Since then, the GOP-led Congress has passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut bill and a two-year spending deal which, together, are expected to drive the deficit and debt further upward. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates annual deficits could top $2.1 trillion per year in the next decade, which would send the national debt soaring even higher.\n\nRepublicans railed against the national debt level\u00a0under the Obama administration, when it jumped from $10.6 trillion to $19.9 trillion, nearly doubling, but few have been as outspoken about the situation with Republicans controlling Capitol Hill and the White House. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, held up the spending bill last month on the Senate floor, blistering Republicans for doing exactly what they had criticized the Obama administration for doing.\n\n\"I ran for office because I was critical of President Obama's trillion-dollar deficits,\" Paul said at the time. \"Now we have Republicans hand-in-hand with Democrats offering us trillion-dollar deficits.\"\n\nSen.

He's said he's open to eliminating the debt ceiling entirely.", "link": null, "source": "CBS News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Thousands are gathering in Washington Saturday for a protest that organizers claim will be a defining moment in the long-simmering national debate over gun-control legislation. Organizers of the March for Our Lives rally are hoping to draw 500,000 protesters; that would match last year's women's march and make this one of the largest Washington protests since the Vietnam era. It would also bolster claims that the nation is ready to enact sweeping changes to its gun control laws.\n\nMore than 800 marches are planned in cities across America and dozens of locations overseas to be held at roughly the same time.\n\nWashington is generally nonchalant about protests, but Saturday's gathering has prompted more attention and speculation than usual. Police are bracing for the hundreds of thousands expected to gather for the rally, CBS News' Jeff Pegues reports. Washington officials say they are prepared to handle the crowds -- more prepared than they were for the women's march, which far exceeded the organizers' official predictions of 300,000.\n\nThe protesters, many of them high school students, claim that the youth leadership of this initiative is what will set it apart from previous attempts to enact stronger gun-control legislation.\n\nIn the wake of the Feb. 14 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the students have tapped into a powerful current of pro-gun control sentiment that has been building for years. They have also partnered with well-funded liberal groups such as Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun control advocacy group founded by former New York mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg.\n\nPolls indicate that public opinion nationwide may indeed be shifting on an issue that has simmered for generations, and through dozens of mass shootings. A recent CBS News poll found that nearly two-thirds of Americans support stricter laws on gun sales, including an increasing number of Republicans. Sixty-five percent of Americans said as of late February that laws covering the sale of guns should be stricter -- an eight-point increase from December.\n\nAlso, a new poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 69 percent of Americans think gun laws in the United States should be tightened. That's up from 61 percent who said the same in October of 2016 and 55 percent when the AP first asked the question in October of 2013. Overall, 90 percent of Democrats, 50 percent of Republicans and 54 percent of gun owners now favor stricter gun control laws.\n\nBut even with claims of historic social momentum on the issue of gun control, the AP poll also found that nearly half of Americans do not expect elected officials to take action. The CBS News poll found that most Americans who support such stricter gun laws -- 59 percent -- are pessimistic about the prospect of the president and Congress enacting them in the near future. A third are optimistic.\n\nAmong the questions facing march organizers and participants will be how to translate its one-day event Saturday -- regardless of turnout -- into meaningful legislative change. One way is by channeling the current energy into mid-term congressional elections this fall. Students in Florida have focused on youth voter registration and there will be a registration booth at the Saturday rally.\n\nCBS News journalists, embedded with survivors of the\u00a0Parkland, Florida school shooting, take viewers inside the creation of a movement as students turn grief into action in \"39 Days\", a one-hour documentary to be broadcast March 24, 2018 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on CBS.", "link": null, "source": "CBS News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Michael Graham", "body": "On Sunday morning, President Trump wondered in a tweet, \"Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans?

What if there really is no collusion?\n\nIn one sense, the question is irrelevant: Paul Manafort is facing serious money-laundering charges that could land him in jail for 305 years; Gen. Mike Flynn's been found out for his shady dealings with Russia and Turkey; and various other Papadopouli have pleaded guilty to actual\u2014if relatively minor\u2014crimes.\u00a0 So Robert Mueller could eventually issue stacks of indictments whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia or not.\n\nFor more than a year now, Democrats in Congress like Adam Schiff and liberal media outlets have promised Americans proof that \"Trump colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election using hackers and propaganda,\" as one far-Left activist put it.\u00a0 Back in October, Ezra Klein at Vox.com said it's \"almost impossible to believe that there wasn't collusion between Trump's operation and Russia.\"\n\nEven now, two out of three Democrats still believe Russia actually tampered with the polls to steal the election from Hillary Clinton.\n\nWith Trump declared guilty by Democrats and all but convicted in the press, what happens if Mueller confirms the findings of the Republican-controlled House Intelligence Committee -- that there's plenty of Trump campaign incompetence, but no collusion?\n\nFor people who hate or love Trump, it won't matter.

He will have turned out to be right, no matter how many other things he did wrong.\n\nI believe this is the reason Trump stepped on his own good news regarding the McCabe firing.\u00a0 Why he didn't do what many (myself included) considered the smart move: Let McCabe's firing speak for itself.\u00a0 Why he sent out his first-ever tweet attacking special counsel Robert Mueller using the key word: \"collusion:\"\n\n\"The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime,\" he wrote Sunday. \"It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign.

But he was fired, not by Donald Trump, but at the recommendation of FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility. The head of that office is Candace Will, who was given the job in 2004 by then-FBI Director\u2026Robert Mueller.\n\nThe OPR reported acted on allegations that McCabe \"showed a lack of candor\" (is there a nicer way to say \"liar\" than that?) uncovered by the Inspector General, Michael Horowitz. He was appointed by\u2026Barack Obama.\n\nFor everyone other than fringe conspiracy theorists, the evidence of McCabe's bad behavior is indisputable. Even Rep. Schiff\u2014the tip of the Democrats' partisan spear on Russia\u2014conceded Sunday that McCabe's firing \"may have been justified.\"\n\nThat should have been the headline. Instead, Trump tweeted and took it away. As national-security reporter Eli Lake put it at Bloomberg: \"McCabe's Firing Wasn't Political. Until Trump Made It Political.\"\n\nOnce again, I tend to agree with Lake and others who think Trump's missing the mark by making the story anything other than \"Democrat Inside FBI Fired For Fouling Up Trump-Related Investigation, Focus Now Turns To Other Partisan Actors In FBI.\"\u00a0 There is a direct line from McCabe to Peter Strzok and Lisa Page and Bruce Ohr\u2014all of whom were anti-Trump partisans and engaged in behavior that raises legitimate questions about their trustworthiness. And that extends to the trustworthiness of the Obama FBI that sought a questionable warrant to spy on Trump based largely on information from Hillary Clinton's campaign.\n\nTrump appears to be acting on assumption that collusion is his silver bullet.\u00a0 Keep everyone focused on that question, so that when the verdict comes back \"innocent of collusion,\" Trump can declare himself \"not guilty\" of any other charge by default.\u00a0 After all, if the collusion allegation was bogus, isn't the entire investigation?\n\nThat's Trump's case, and it's likely to make sense to the vast majority of Americans who've been promised a collusion story Trump's enemies can't deliver.", "link": null, "source": "CBS News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "", "body": "Alex Emmons of The Intercept reported Wednesday that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has reportedly bragged to multiple parties that Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, was \"in his pocket,\" citing a source who speaks often with confidants of the Saudi and Emirati rulers.

An increasingly confident Mr. Trump is privately weighing still more changes, expressing frustration with certain advisers and sifting through possible replacements.\n\nMany close to Mr. Trump think more upheaval is coming soon. The president is moving toward replacing national security adviser H.R. McMaster, but has not settled on exact timing or a successor, said four people with knowledge of White House deliberations. Kelly has also worn on the president, confidants of the president said. And Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, under fire for ethics violations, appears to be grasping to keep his job.\n\nSo intense was the swirl of speculation about McMaster that White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders tried to tamp things down late Thursday by tweeting: \"Just spoke to @POTUS and Gen. H.R. McMaster - contrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC.\"\n\nThis account of the tensions in the White House is based on conversations with 10 officials inside the White House and familiar with West Wing deliberations, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters.\n\nAfter more than 14 months in office, Mr. Trump is reshaping his administration, seeking people more likely to fall in line with his policies and tolerate his moods. The factionalism that defined the early days of his tenure has faded and he has lost some of the close aides who could manage his volatile impulses. To some, the White House is increasing taking on the feel of a team of cheerleaders more than a team of rivals.\n\nWhile dismissing news reports of looming departures, Trump also appeared to signal more changes to come on Thursday, telling reporters: \"There will always be change.\"\n\nMr. Trump's administration has set records for turnover among senior administration aides. Top economic adviser Gary Cohn and communications director Hope Hicks are leaving the White House in coming weeks. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was just unceremoniously ousted, on Twitter.

Though the drumbeat of the ongoing Russia probe has only grown louder, the president believes that his recent decisions on tariffs and North Korea have breathed new life into his administration, and he is eager to take more \"bold steps\" that make his own mark. He has told confidants he wants to rid himself of staffers who hold him back.\n\nMr. Trump chafes at McMaster's demeanor, complaining that his aide lectures him, according to three current and former administration officials. Officials said McMaster has been sidelined in some internal discussions, with Kelly taking on a more active role in foreign policy decisions, because of the personal tensions.\n\nThe president and McMaster have disagreed on a number of issues \u2014 including the Iran deal and the U.S. approach to North Korea \u2014 and the national security adviser has also clashed with Kelly and Defense Secretary James Mattis, according to the officials.\n\nMcMaster, in turn, is not a natural fit for the scattershot policy-making process in the White House and dislikes the internal rivalries that so often divide the West Wing. He was the target of online attacks from the fringes of the right wing last summer, including for his alleged insufficient support of Israel.\n\nDuring an earlier round of Trump discontent with his national security adviser, there was White House talk of providing McMaster, a three-star general, with a soft landing by giving him a fourth star along with a command in a priority area such as Afghanistan or Korea, according to a former senior administration official.\n\nKelly has been credited with imposing order on the chaotic West Wing, but his relationship with Mr. Trump has come under strain too.\n\nMr. Trump was said to be deeply irritated and to have considered firing Kelly over the negative publicity surrounding his handling of the controversy over ousted White House aide Rob Porter, who was accused of domestic abuse. The president also recently told an ally that he was still frustrated by an interview that Kelly gave to Fox News nearly two months ago in which he suggested that Trump had \"evolved\" in his thinking about the need for a wall on the Mexican border.\n\nAt least one of Mr. Trump's \"generals\" \u2014 the collection of military advisers he used to boast about \u2014 remains largely in good standing. The president is said to remain pleased with Mattis, as the defense secretary rarely publicly disagrees with Mr. Trump and has succeeded in quietly working through any differences, according to three White House officials and outside advisers.\n\nMr. Trump has expressed frustration with aides whom he believes try to \"manage\" him according to several current and former White House officials \u2014 and has grown tired of efforts by his staff to stall controversial actions they disagree with.

Tech company Hiya says it has partnered with AT&T to begin doing just that.\n\n\"We apply machine learning and advanced algorithms to look for patterns with which to identify spammers and robocallers,\" said Hiya CEO Alex Algard.\n\nTelecommunications trade group CTIA says all of the national wireless carriers now offer robocall prevention options. T-Mobile launched scam ID where the screen indicates \"scam likely\" for suspected fraudulent calls, Verizon says it has \"spam alert\" which warns customers about identified robocalls, and Sprint has premium caller ID which shows callers names that are not in your contact list. There are also over 500 apps customers can use to arm themselves.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0But consumer groups like the National Consumer Law Center say even with those steps, consumers still get far too many robocalls.

CIA Director Mike Pompeo appointed Haspel as the first female CIA officer to be named deputy director on February 2, 2017. She has extensive overseas experience, including several stints as chief of station at outposts abroad. In Washington, she has held several top senior leadership positions, including deputy director of the National Clandestine Service and deputy director of the National Clandestine Service for Foreign Intelligence and Covert Action.\n\nShe also had a role in the CIA's former covert program where suspected terrorists were subjected to harsh interrogation methods, including waterboarding, which simulates drowning. More than a decade after it was last used, the CIA is still haunted by the legacy of a tactic that the U.S. government regarded as torture before the Bush administration authorized its use against terrorist suspects.\n\nThere was speculation at the time of her appointment as to whether Pompeo's pick signaled an attempt to restart the harsh interrogation and detention program. News organizations obtained a copy of a draft executive order that would study recommendations on whether the U.S. should reopen CIA detention facilities outside the United States. It would also have ordered a review of interrogation methods used on terror suspects and called for suggested modifications that would not violate the U.S. legal ban on torture.\n\nHaspel briefly ran a secret CIA prison where accused terrorists Abu Zubayadah and Abd al Rahim al-Nashiri were waterboarded in 2002, according to current and former U.S. intelligence officials, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

If you are allowed to carry a concealed weapon in your home state, you would be allowed to carry it in all of them.\n\nThe Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act has already sailed through the House of Representatives and has the full support of President Trump. It has roughly 40 co-sponsors in the Senate where a showdown is shaping up between the gun lobby and law enforcement over states' rights and the second amendment.\n\nThis is the handgun counter at Van's Sporting Goods outside Jackson, Mississippi, a state with the fourth highest gun fatality rate in the country and some of the weakest gun laws.\n\nPretty much anyone 18 years of age and not a convicted felon can carry one of these concealed weapons here in their pocket, their pants or their purse for self-defense against muggers, carjackers and other assailants.\n\nIf the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act becomes law, they'll be able to carry them legally across state lines and onto the streets of any city in America.\n\nTim Schmidt: I think the aim of this bill is to simply allow responsibly armed Americans to-- to be able to travel and-- and-- and continue to defend their families.\n\nTim Schmidt is president and founder of the United States Concealed Carry Association. Along with the National Rifle Association and other gun-rights groups, they have successfully sold the bill in conservative red states as a simple, common sense solution to a hodgepodge of confusing, contradictory state laws they say infringe upon Americans' rights to bear arms.\n\nTim Schmidt: These laws change on a quarterly basis, if not more often. So you can easily go from being a responsibly armed citizen, who's 100 percent legal, to being a criminal just by crossing state lines.\n\nBut there is fierce opposition to it in places like California, where there are strict gun laws and concealed carry permits are difficult to obtain. It's one of eight states that generally require thorough background checks, at least some firearms training and a proven need to carry a handgun. In another 30 states, it's easier to get a concealed carry permit and in many of those, there's no requirement to be proficient in the use of firearms. A dozen states have no requirements at all.\n\nRobyn Thomas, the executive director of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, says forcing states to accept any and all gun permits would make the weakest laws in the country the new norm.\n\nRobyn Thomas: Someone who lives in Nevada, who's able to carry a loaded, concealed weapon in Nevada could now bring that loaded gun into Los Angeles, into San Francisco, and carry their loaded weapon, even though in San Francisco that's not someone who would get a permit.\n\nSteve Kroft: So this law would essentially usurp the gun laws in cities like New York and Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\nTo blue state liberals who favor gun control, it may sound like a right-wing fantasy but to the National Rifle Association, which contributed 30 million dollars to Donald Trump's presidential campaign and claims credit for his victory, it's their top legislative priority. And with midterm elections this year, nothing is taken for granted. In 2013, a similar bill failed by just three votes.\n\nThe NRA declined to give us an interview for this story but its position is well-documented on its website.

I call on Congress and the president-elect to pass national right to carry reciprocity as quickly as it can be written and signed. The individual right to carry a firearm in defense of our lives and our families does not and should not end at any state line.\n\nAs proof of injustice, the NRA and other gun rights advocates use the case of Shaneen Allen as ammunition.\n\nIn 2013, while driving from Philadelphia to Atlantic City, New Jersey, the single mother and mugging victim was pulled over with a pistol in her purse and a valid concealed carry permit from her home state of Pennsylvania.\n\nRep.

Richard Hudson: What she didn't know is that New Jersey didn't recognize Pennsylvania's concealed carry permit. So this single mom who had never had a run-in with the law spent almost two months in jail and was facing ten years in prison because she'd crossed that state line.\n\nSteve Kroft: How was the case finally adjudicated?\n\nRep. Richard Hudson: Governor Chris Christie stepped in and pardoned her-- otherwise, like I say, she was facing ten years in prison.\n\nSteve Kroft: How often does that happen?\n\nRep. Richard Hudson: Well, it-- once is too much. These are law-abiding citizens, these are not the problem.\n\nThe large constituency for this message is a long way from the New Jersey Turnpike, in the red states that stretch from the Carolinas through the mountains of the far west. It is the political fault line of regional and cultural differences that split the country and guns are one of the triggers. They're woven into the culture here, passed down from generation to generation in rural, remote parts of the country where dialing 911 does not always bring immediate help. To people here, whether they're single mothers worried about robbers and rapists while driving their kids across state lines to soccer matches, or ranchers worried about rattlesnakes, guns are a security blanket of self-reliance and protection that keep them safe.\n\nScott Yarbro: For me, it's just a way of life. It's like when I get up in the morning and I get dressed, I get my wallet, I get my watch, I get my keys, I get my phone. It's the same thing to get my gun.\n\nBut in most big cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C. and New York, \u00a0guns are a cause of fear and concern, not comfort. And law enforcement has lined up against strangers from far away places walking around their cities with loaded guns in violation of their own laws.\n\nCyrus Vance: I think it would be a disaster for New York City. And I think for major cities around the country.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance and New York City Police Commissioner James O'Neill say their city has the most to lose. Every year, New York takes in nearly 50 million visitors from all over the country into a congested, sometimes chaotic city. Even if a tiny fraction were legally carrying concealed weapons, it would mean hundreds of thousands of additional guns for what is right now the safest big city in America.\n\nCyrus Vance: You bring that kind of volume of firepower even with well-intentioned people-- it's gonna be extremely dangerous.\n\nSteve Kroft: More guns, more violence. That's what you're saying.\n\nThey're not just worried about more crime, but an increase in suicides, gun accidents and heated arguments turning into lethal altercations. And with no national database for concealed carry permits, the NYPD says it would not be able to immediately determine whether someone was legally carrying or not.\n\nJames O'Neill: Right now we-- we have a good idea of-- of who's carrying guns. If this law passes, the-- all bets are off. Anybody can come into New York City from any state and-- and carry a weapon.\n\nCyrus Vance: I wouldn't presume to tell the residents of West Virginia what their gun laws should be. They've figured out what they want there. But I don't think they, or Congress, should be having West Virginia's laws put on New York City.\n\nCyrus Vance at press conference: The people who are strongest against this bill are law enforcement.\n\nVance and O'Neill have established a formidable coalition of prosecutors and police chiefs from nearly every big city in America to lobby senators to keep the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act from becoming law.\n\nSteve Kroft: Representative Hudson, there's huge opposition to this bill, among police departments in major cities in the United States-- Houston. Tucson. Metropolitan DC. Boston. New York City. Baltimore. Seattle. These are all cities where the chief of police has come out against this law. I can-- there are more, if you want me to read more.\n\nRep. Richard Hudson: Sure. Well, look--\n\nSteve Kroft: Now how do you explain that?\n\nRep. Richard Hudson: There are folks on both sides of the argument-- and I think good folks on both sides, who are honestly trying to protect their citizens. I just disagree with the conclusions\u2014\n\nSteve Kroft: So you're saying New York or Los Angeles or Chicago big cities have no right to pass any laws that regulate who can carry-- a weapon.\n\nRep. Richard Hudson: These cities and these states can still continue to have whatever laws they want to protect their citizens.\n\nSteve Kroft: Except they can't have a law that prohibits someone from carrying a concealed weapon?\n\nRep. Richard Hudson: Right. Just like a driver's license. You can't say you can't drive here --\n\nSteve Kroft: It's not just like a driver's license. Because to get a driver's license, you have to demonstrate a proficiency and-- and establish that you're not going to endanger the public and that you understand all the laws governing it. But that's not the case in terms of possessing--\n\nRep. Richard Hudson: But driving is a privilege, owning a firearm is a Constitutionally protected right. So there is a difference.\n\nThe central tenet of Concealed Carry Reciprocity is that the Second Amendment gives people the right to carry guns anywhere they want but that idea is more aspiration than factual.\n\nSteve Kroft: Is there such a thing?\n\nRobyn Thomas: Absolutely not. In fact, the Supreme Court has ruled on the Second Amendment in 2008. And what the Supreme Court said is that you have a right to have a handgun in your home for self-defense. And it absolutely does not include a right to carry a loaded, concealed weapon in public. And right up until the Supreme Court says it is your right, that is a fallacy that they're pushing, in the hopes that it will become the truth. But it simply isn't the truth as of right now.\n\nBut Tim Schmidt of the U.S. Concealed Carry Association thinks it should be.\n\nSteve Kroft: The Bill of Rights doesn't say that anybody could walk around with a gun in their pocket or a gun in their hostler-- a concealed weapon. It doesn't say that.\n\nTim Schmidt: Steve, with all due respect, it actually does. It says you have the right to keep and bear arms and it shall not be infringed. Telling me where I can and can't carry a gun, telling me where I can and can't protect my family and loved ones, that's an infringement. Yes, that's gone on for a long time in our country, but we're finally fixing it.\n\nAs in almost all political arguments today, each side comes equipped with alternative facts and opposition research, allowing people to believe whatever they want. The NRA claims the only way to stop bad guys with guns is to have more good guys with guns -- it will make people safer\u2026and its facts, as recited by representative Hudson of North Carolina, claim it's working.\n\nRep. Richard Hudson: I can tell you that, you know, \u00a0in the last 20 years, you've seen-- a huge uptick in gun ownership. You've seen a huge uptick in conceal carry permit holders, and at the same time, you see violent crime drop. If you look at the states that have Constitutional carry, you've seen violent crime drop.\n\nSteve Kroft: Are you saying that the more guns that are out there, the safer the population is?\n\nRep. Richard Hudson: I dunno if I'd go quite that far. But, you know, I'm-- I'm not gonna come out here and say the-- the solution to gun violence is give everyone a gun. But I'm also saying that's not gonna necessarily increase violence.\n\nThat conclusion has been refuted by numerous studies, as well as testimony from chiefs of police like Edward Flynn in Milwaukee, who says Wisconsin's six-year experiment with lax concealed carry laws has been a disaster.\n\nChief Edward Flynn in 2017: Every year since that law was passed in 2011, every year, non-fatal shootings have gone up, gun-related homicides have gone up, and the number of guns seized from the streets by our department has gone up.That's what our cockamamie law has done here.\n\nSteve Kroft: Why is this bill so important to the NRA?\n\nCyrus Vance: The goal is, of the gun lobby, to have what they call Constitutional Carry, which means that you-- anyone can have a gun, anywhere, anytime. Because the Constitution, and the Second Amendment, in their view, says that. And so the world that they imagine is one where everyone can have a gun. That's not the world that I think I wanna live in. But that's the world that I think they're tryin' to create.\n\nWhether people like it or not, that world already exists in many parts of the country where people are quite happy with it and so are their representatives in Congress.

A commitment under the law would have made it more difficult if not impossible for Nikolas Cruz to obtain a gun legally.\n\nCruz is accused of the shooting rampage that killed 14 students and three school employees at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland on Feb. 14. In addition, 17 people were wounded.\n\nBut more than a year earlier, documents in the criminal case against Nikolas Cruz and obtained by The Associated Press show school officials and a sheriff's deputy recommended in September 2016 that Cruz be involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation.\n\nThe documents, which are part of Cruz's criminal case in the shooting, show that he had written the word \"kill\" in a notebook, told a classmate that he wanted to buy a gun and use it, and had cut his arm supposedly in anger because he had broken up with a girlfriend. He also told another student he had drunk gasoline and was throwing up. Calls had even been made to the FBI about the possibility of Cruz using a gun at school.\n\nThe documents were provided by a psychological assessment service initiated by Cruz's mother called Henderson Behavioral Health. The documents show a high school resource officer who was also a sheriff's deputy and two school counselors recommended in September 2016 that Cruz be committed for mental evaluation under Florida's Baker Act. That law allows for involuntary commitment for mental health examination for at least three days.\n\nSuch an involuntary commitment would also have been a high obstacle if not a complete barrier to legally obtaining a firearm, such as the AR-15 rifle used in the Stoneman Douglas massacre on Feb. 14, authorities say.\n\nIn the month since the shooting, survivors from the school have called for reforms in gun laws. On March 14, they encouraged students nationwide to take part in the March for Our Lives, a walkout from school\u00a0 to protest gun violence.\n\nThere is no evidence Cruz was ever committed. Coincidentally, the school resource officer who recommended that Cruz be \"Baker Acted\" was Scot Peterson -- the same Broward Sheriff's Office deputy who resigned amid accusations he failed to respond to the shooting by staying outside the building where the killings occurred.\n\nDavid S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor, said that an involuntary commitment would have been a huge red flag had Cruz attempted to buy a firearm legally.\n\n\"If he had lied, hopefully the verification of the form would have pulled up the commitment paperwork,\" Weinstein said.\n\nThe documents do not say why Cruz was not committed under the Baker Act or whether he may not have qualified for other reasons.

He faces the death penalty if convicted, but his public defender Melisa McNeill has said he would plead guilty in return for a life prison sentence.\n\nIn the Henderson Behavioral Health documents, Cruz's mother Lynda is quoted as saying she had fresh concerns about her son's mental state after he punched holes in a wall at their home in Parkland. The clinicians at Henderson came to the home for interviews and said Cruz admitted punching the wall but said he did so because he was upset at a breakup with his girlfriend.\n\nCruz also admitted cutting his arm with a pencil sharpener.\n\nAfter a Sept. 28, 2016 interview, the documents say Cruz \"reports that he cut his arms 3-4 weeks ago and states that this is the only time he has ever cut.

(Cruz) states that he is better now, reports that he is no longer lonely and states that his grades have gone back up.\"\n\nHe also told the clinician he owned only a pellet gun and was not capable of doing \"serious harm\" to anyone.\n\nThe documents show that Cruz was very much on the radar screen of mental health professionals and the Broward County school system, yet very little appears to have been done other than these evaluations.\n\nOther red flags have also surfaced, including calls to the FBI about Cruz's potential to become a school shooter and numerous visits by county law enforcement officials to his home -- both before his mother died in November and after, when he lived briefly with a family friend in Palm Beach County.\n\nAgain, very little was done.\n\nIt's not clear from the documents who the recommendation was forwarded to or why it was not followed up.", "link": null, "source": "CBS News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Alan He", "body": "The tech giant Facebook is facing a growing backlash on Capitol Hill as more lawmakers demand that CEO Mark Zuckerberg testify about reports that Cambridge Analytica, a political data consulting firm utilized by the Trump campaign, harvested the information of up to 50 million users.\n\n\"Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify under oath in public before the Judiciary Committee.

So did U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, in what ultimately became one of his last public statements before being fired.\n\nBut at the White House, President Donald Trump's initial response was more circumspect. In his first remarks on the incident, Mr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday morning: \"It sounds to me that it would be Russia based on all the evidence they have.\"\n\nHe added a qualification, however: \"As soon as we get the facts straight, if we agree with them, we will condemn Russia or whoever it may be.\"\n\nMr. Trump's spokeswoman pointedly avoided naming Russia as the likely perpetrator of the attack. Tougher rhetoric came only on Wednesday evening, when White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders put out a statement saying the U.S. \"stands in solidarity with its closest ally\" and shares Britain's assessment that \"Russia is responsible for the reckless nerve agent attack.\"\n\nFor U.S. allies and some congressional lawmakers, it was another befuddling example of the president appearing to soft-pedal in the face of Moscow's provocations. Some Russia watchers said the fact that the U.S. had to play catch-up to align itself with the British was glaring, particularly at a time of uncertainty over the trajectory of American foreign policy.\n\n\"It's striking the contrast between what the Brits have done and what the U.S. has not done,\" said Angela Stent, director of Georgetown University's Center for Eurasian, Russian, and East European Studies. Stent said that while it's unlikely the U.S. would levy new sanctions on Russia over an incident on British soil, \"you would still expect solidarity\" from Washington.\n\nThe pressure on Mr. Trump to forcefully respond to the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian agent convicted of spying for Britain, and his daughter Yulia escalated Wednesday when May announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats and severed high-level contacts with Moscow. May also vowed both open and covert action against Russia, which denies being behind the nerve agent attack.\n\nThe White House initially said Trump agreed with May on \"the need for consequences\" following the attack, but did not specify whether the U.S. planned any punishment of its own. Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Wednesday that Russia must cooperate with the British investigation and \"account for its actions.\"\n\nSanders' statement Wednesday evening went further: \"The latest action by Russia fits into a pattern of behavior in which Russia disregards the international rules-based order, undermines the sovereignty and security of countries worldwide, and attempts to subvert and discredit Western democratic institutions and processes. The United States is working together with our allies and partners to ensure that this kind of abhorrent attack does not happen again.\"\n\nSome congressional lawmakers had nudged Trump to bolster the U.S. response, including Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who said, \"Americans ought to be leading a conversation with our NATO allies about a collective response to this act and future acts of aggression.\"\n\nMay's rapid response stands in stark contrast to Mr. Trump's handling of Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election, which is now a centerpiece of special counsel Robert Mueller's sprawling investigation. Trump has often muddied the conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies, declaring that while Russia interfered, others likely did as well. And he's irritated Russia hawks in Congress, including numerous Republicans, by declining to use a new law letting the U.S. slap sanctions on foreign companies or governments that do business with Russia's defense or intelligence sectors. Those powers took effect in January, but so far nobody has been punished.\n\nThis latest Russian provocation against a close U.S. partner comes at a particularly delicate moment for the Trump administration, with both allies and adversaries closely watching U.S. foreign policy after Tillerson's ouster. Though Tillerson faced initial skepticism about his posture toward Russia given his business relationships with the Kremlin, the former head of ExxonMobil emerged as a leading Russia critic in the Trump Cabinet. He repeatedly took Moscow to task for its actions in Ukraine, Syria and elsewhere.\n\n\"Rex Tillerson was the person that Donald Trump was relying on for Russia policy,\" said Andrew Weiss, who held national security positions during the Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush administrations and now serves as vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"That's all now up for grabs.\"\n\nMr. Trump has tapped CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace Tillerson at the State Department. The former Republican congressman has accepted the intelligence agencies' conclusion that Russia interfered in the election, but has downplayed the notion that the meddling was an effort to help Mr. Trump get elected.\n\n\"The Russians attempted to interfere in the United States election in 2016. They also did so before that,\" Pompeo told Fox News Sunday. \"There's a long history of Russian efforts to influence the United States and conduct influence operations against the United States.\"\n\nPompeo also raised eyebrows earlier this year by meeting senior Russian security officials in Washington days before the Trump administration declined to impose new sanctions on Moscow over the election interference. Pompeo described the meetings as normal contacts for the heads of espionage services.\n\nIf Pompeo is confirmed by the Senate, the U.S. relationship with Russia will be among the most vexing issues he has to tackle.

He said the video shows that the marshal \"panicked\" and should have used other methods to subdue Angilau. He points out that Angilau was already down on the ground for the final three shots and that a courtroom full of officers could have stopped him before he harmed anyone with the pen.\n\n\"There was no need to use deadly force,\" Sykes said. \"They weren't entitled to use the death penalty on him for an assault.\"\n\nSykes said the Angilau family hasn't decided if they'll appeal the ruling throwing out the wrongful death lawsuit.\n\nAngilau was one of 17 people named in a 2010 indictment accusing Tongan Crip members of assault, conspiracy, robbery and weapons offenses.

Industry groups and some lawmakers are scrambling to prevent a new front in a potential trade war that could reverberate across the U.S. economy.\n\nEarly indications from the White House have officials braced for tariffs across a wide variety of consumer goods, from apparel to electronics, and even on imported parts for products made in the U.S. The size and scope remain under debate, but the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is warning that annual tariffs of as much as $60 billion on Chinese goods would be \"devastating.\"\n\nMr. Trump's focus on China could be even more consequential, both at home and abroad, than the recently announced penalty tariffs on steel and aluminum. And amid the staff turmoil at the White House, it's being read as a sign of rising influence for the administration's populist economic aides, led by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and adviser Peter Navarro.\n\nEven Larry Kudlow \u2014 an avowed free trader tapped to replace Gary Cohn as director of the White House National Economic Council \u2014 has said that China deserves a \"tough response\" from the United States and its friends. He told CNBC this week, \"The United States could lead a coalition of large trading partners and allies against China.\"\n\nBut with these tariffs, the Trump administration appears so far to be content to go it alone.\n\nOn Friday, the National Retail Federation, which recently hosted industry groups to organize opposition to another round of tariffs, convened a conference call to update its members. \"They're all concerned about this,\" said David French, vice president for government relations. \"Tariffs are a tax on consumers and they're best used sparingly as tools.\"\n\nTrade experts and economists say the tariffs could lead to rising prices for U.S. consumers and businesses without accomplishing one of the president's stated goals: reducing last year's trade imbalance of $566 billion.\n\nChina, the largest source of the trade imbalance, would likely respond to any tariffs by retaliating with higher import taxes on U.S. goods, among other possible restrictions.\n\n\"They signaled that they will aim at things that affect the United States politically as well as economically,\" said Claude Barfield, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and former consultant with the U.S. trade representative.\n\n\"The farmer in Kansas or Iowa could feel it,\" he said. \"U.S. high tech companies could feel it because the supply chains for iPhones go through China.\"\n\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill, who have largely been shut out of administration deliberations, fear tariffs would stunt economic benefits in the U.S. that could be stemming from the GOP tax cuts.\n\nRepublican leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, have urged the administration to target any proposed tariffs as narrowly as possible, away from U.S. allies and focused on countries engaged in over-production and product dumping.\n\nRepublicans in Congress largely opposed Mr. Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs and are working with the administration on a process for allowing waivers or carve outs for certain countries or types of metals, beyond the exemption the White House is allowing for Canada and Mexico.\n\n\"We want to narrow this,\" Brady, who has been in talks with Ross all week, said Friday on Fox. \"Tariffs are taxes \u2014 lower is better, zero is the best.\"\n\nThe new tariffs on China would be tied to an investigation into the country's failure to stop intellectual property theft, a probe that was launched in August as part of the rarely used Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.\n\nBeyond the trade imbalance, the Trump administration hasn't fully explained to the public which specific steps it wants China to take, creating a degree of uncertainty.\n\n\"Is the endgame just the tariffs or is this the beginning of negotiation? It's hard to know what the ultimate intent of the administration is,\" said Rod Hunter, a lawyer at Baker & McKenzie who previously coordinated global economic policies during George W. Bush's administration.\n\nAlready, the steel and aluminum tariffs have sparked a response from the European Union, which Friday released a list of U.S. products \u2014 from whiskey and motorcycles to breakfast foods and batteries \u2014 it plans to introduce duties on if the 28-nation bloc is not exempted.\n\nCBS News' Margaret Brennan reports that the steel and aluminum tariffs also go into effect on Friday March 23 so the rollout of new tariffs may help offset press coverage claiming Mr. Trump softened his position on the first round of tariffs. He is considering giving carveouts to U.S. security partners, like South Korea, when it comes to the steel and aluminum tariffs.\n\n\"The president's going to continue fighting for the American worker,\" said Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. \"He's also working with a number of individual countries and negotiating on areas of national security where we can work together, and there's some flexibility there, and we're continuing to have those conversations.\"\n\nSen.

And many pro-gun rights Republicans didn't like the idea of raising the minimum age to buy rifles from 18 to 21 and to create a waiting period on sales of the weapons.\n\nThe Senate amended its bill to limit which teachers could volunteer to go through law enforcement training and carry guns in schools. Any teacher who does nothing but work in a classroom would not be eligible for the program, but teachers who perform other duties, such as serving as a coach, and other school employees could still participate. Other exceptions would be made for teachers who are current or former law enforcement officers, members of the military or who teach in a Junior Reserve Officer's Training Corps program.\n\nThe bill would name the program for slain assistant football coach Aaron Feis, who has been hailed as a hero for shielding students during the school attack. The 37-year-old graduated from Stoneman Douglas in 1999 and worked mainly with the junior varsity, living in nearby Coral Springs with his wife and daughter. Republican Sen.

That we've gotten somewhere,\" he said. \"We're hitting nerves. We're going into areas that may not be our comfort zone.\"\n\nAnd he said the bill will make a difference. In addition to the gun restrictions and arming some school personnel, it would create new mental health programs for schools, improve communication between schools, law enforcement and state agencies, create a task force to look at mistakes made during mass shootings nationally and then make recommendations on how to continue to improve law, and establish an anonymous tip line where students and others can report threats to schools.\n\n\"This bill will make a difference now.

I think he needs backup.\"\n\nDemocrats must flip 24 GOP-held seats this fall to seize control of the House, and months ago few had counted on the district to be in play. The seat has been in Republican hands for the past 15 years.\n\nIt was open now only because longtime Republican congressman Tim Murphy, who espoused strong anti-abortion views, resigned last fall amid revelations of an extramarital affair in which he urged his mistress to get an abortion.\n\nWith polls showing a tight race for months, Saccone tried to persuade the GOP-leaning electorate that their choice was about \"making America great again,\" as the president repeatedly says.\n\nSaccone, a 60-year-old Air Force veteran turned state lawmaker and college instructor, enjoyed enthusiastic backing from the social conservatives who've anchored his state career. He's been perhaps at his most animated when emphasizing his opposition to abortion rights.\n\nYet Saccone struggled to raise money and stir the same passions that helped Trump on his way to the White House. The consistent fundraising deficit left him with limited resources to air the message he delivered one-on-one: His four decades of experience in the private sector, international business and now the Legislature should make voters' choice a no-brainer.\n\nLamb, meanwhile, excited core Democrats and aimed for independents and moderate Republicans.\n\n\"We worked really hard for it,\" Lamb said after voting.\n\nNational Republican groups filled airwaves and social media with depictions of the first-time candidate as little more than a lemming for Nancy Pelosi \u2014 the Democratic House leader that Republicans love to hate.\n\nLamb answered the criticism by saying he wouldn't support Pelosi as floor leader, much less as speaker if the Democrats should retake control of the House. He also said he opposes major new gun restrictions \u2014 though he backs expanded background checks \u2014 and declared himself personally opposed to abortion, despite his support for its legality.\n\nBesides bruising the president, a Lamb defeat also could shake Republican self-assurance that their new tax law can shield them from other political woes.\n\nLamb embraced Democratic orthodoxy on the new GOP tax law, hammering it as a giveaway to corporations at the future expense of Social Security, Medicare and the nation's fiscal security.

Republican lawmakers are talking more seriously about some restrictions, but not a total ban.\n\nInstead, they're discussing treating assault-style rifles like the one suspected gunman Nikolas Cruz is accused of using in the Valentine's Day attack more like handguns than long guns. That could mean raising the minimum age to purchase the weapon to 21, creating a waiting period and making it more difficult for people who exhibit signs of mental illness from buying the weapon even without a diagnosis.\n\nDemocrats attempted to get a bill to ban assault rifles and large-capacity magazines heard on the House floor on Tuesday.

It was a small sign of movement on the gun violence issue that has long tied Washington in knots.\n\n\"We must do more to protect our children,\" said Mr. Trump, a strong and vocal supporter of gun rights.

However, many members of the party still have strong resistance to any gun-control measures.\n\nThe Parkland students also plan to meet Wednesday with top legislative leaders, including House Speaker Richard Corcoran and Senate President Joe Negron.\n\nFlorida has a reputation for expanding gun rights. Negron sponsored a 2011 bill that Republican Gov. Rick Scott signed into law that banned cities and counties from regulating gun and ammunition sales.\n\nScott organized three committees to look at school safety, mental health and gun safety issues that met Tuesday and vowed to make changes to better protect students.

He also pledged to increase spending on school safety programs and on mental health treatment.\n\nAuthorities said Cruz, 19, had a string of run-ins with school authorities that ended with his expulsion. Police were repeatedly called to his house throughout his childhood. His lawyers said there were many warning signs that he was mentally unstable and potentially violent. Yet he legally purchased a semi-automatic rifle.\n\nNewly released documents reveal that in September 2016, an investigator with\u00a0Florida's Department of Children and Families\u00a0(DCF) visited the family to investigate allegations of medical neglect. The investigator noted Cruz had depression, ADHD and autism.

Cruz told the deputy he had been angry because he misplaced a photo of his recently deceased mother, and he apologized for losing his temper.\n\nThe other man told the deputy he didn't want Cruz arrested. He just wanted Cruz to calm down before coming home.\n\nCBS News has also learned there was a 20 minute delay in the school's surveillance video. Police say that caused confusion for officers during the shooting trying to find the gunman, but police say no more lives were put in danger because of it.\n\nThat failure is one of many admitted missteps by local and federal law enforcement.\n\nThe FBI is dealing with its handling of complaints made against Cruz. A federal law enforcement source describes the failure on the FBI's end as a \"body blow\" for the entire bureau.\n\nThe shooting has reignited national debate over gun laws and school safety, including proposals by President Trump and others to designate more people -- including teachers -- to carry arms on school grounds.

She said the state agency is assisting.\n\nHickman, who is shown on video subduing and punching 33-year-old Johnnie Jermaine Rush, had a history of treating people rudely, according to a city memo that also seeks to address concerns about why the case unfolded slowly outside of public view.\n\nThe August excessive-force case, revealed last week when a newspaper published body-cam video, has roiled leaders in Asheville, a mountain tourist destination with a liberal-leaning, mostly white population. Late Monday, the Asheville City Council voted to release a memo detailing how the case was handled.\n\nThe case became public after The Citizen-Times newspaper published footage last week.\n\nRush, whom officers had accused of jaywalking, was also shocked with a stun gun as he screamed in pain. The altercation unfolded around midnight Aug. 25 near the city's minor-league baseball stadium and a cluster of breweries that help fuel a booming tourism industry.\n\nCity Manager Gary Jackson wrote in the memo Monday that Hickman's use of \"excessive and dangerous force\" is \"a source of great anger and concern within the community.\" Asheville's population of nearly 90,000 is 82 percent white and 12 percent black. Hickman resigned in January.\n\nPastor Ronald Gates, who joined other black clergy members in voicing concerns to city leaders last week, said he was appalled not only by \"the inhumane act\" he saw on the video, but also the length of time it took for details to surface publicly.\n\nHowever, the leader of Greater Works Church said Tuesday that the memo's release is a step toward restoring trust: \"There's a strong stance toward making things right.\"\n\nAccording to the memo, an extensive review of body camera footage from all of Hickman's encounters with the public - some 58 hours - revealed four other times in which he \"displayed discourteous and rude conduct to members of the public.\" It's not clear if those four incidents were previously known to Hickman's superiors; Jackson wrote that they didn't result in complaints. The memo doesn't elaborate on what happened in those cases.\n\nThe Asheville newspaper's story sparked recriminations over the handling of the case and the video leak. Under North Carolina law, a judge generally must sign off on any public release of police body camera video.\n\nDistrict Attorney Todd Williams issued a statement last week that the video leak could compromise prosecutions and \"may require its own independent investigation.\" Asheville police Chief Tammy Hooper, who issued an apology to Rush, has also called for an investigation of the leak.\n\nYet on Monday, Asheville City Attorney Robin Currin requested that a judge allow public release of all video surrounding Rush's arrest, noting \"it is critical that the public be provided with a complete picture.\"\n\nThe memo released Monday by the City Council gives the most complete account yet of the case.\n\nHours after he was arrested, Rush filed an excessive force complaint. The memo says the police chief reviewed footage that day, ordered that Hickman turn in his badge and gun and placed him on administrative duty. A supervisor who responded to the scene was also disciplined over the handling of information in the case.\n\nCharges against Rush, including impeding traffic and resisting arrest, were dropped in September. No working phone listing could be found for Rush, who's heard on video saying he was leaving work when officers accused him of failing to use a crosswalk.\n\nAfter the administrative investigation finished in December, the department concluded Hickman used excessive force.

Pete Wilson claimed his first term as California governor, replacing another Republican, George Deukmejian. Two years earlier, California voters helped send George H.W. Bush to the White House with a 3.6-point win over Democrat Michael Dukakis.\n\nNearly three decades later, so much has changed.\n\nDemocrats have monopolized California government, with the party holding every statewide office and dominating both chambers of the Legislature. Bush was the last Republican to win a presidential contest in the state. President Donald Trump lost California by over 4 million votes to Hillary Clinton.\n\nCan the party that now accounts for just 1-in-4 state voters make a comeback? And if so, how?\n\nFormer Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger will take up that question again Wednesday at an event in Los Angeles organized by New Way California, a political committee eager to reshape the state GOP.\n\nSchwarzenegger will be joined by another Republican centrist, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who was a Trump rival in the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nWhile a registered Republican, Schwarzenegger is known for his varied political stripes. As far back as 2007, in his second term as governor, he warned that the GOP was \"dying at the box office\" and needed to claim issues usually associated with the Democratic agenda, such as climate change and health care reform.\n\nAt the time, he said the GOP could win elections by \"including, not excluding. By being open to new ideas.\"\n\nThe effort to move the state party in a different direction comes at a time when Mr. Trump is the dominant figure in national Republican politics, and conservatives hold sway in Washington.\n\nThe former bodybuilder and actor has argued for years that Republicans are out of step with too many voters and need to move toward the political center to revive the party's fortunes in the strongly Democratic state.\n\nIt's often said the future happens first in California and, if so, the outlook is unsettling for Republicans.\n\nCalifornia was once the home of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, but Republican influence in the state has been declining for years as a surge in immigrants transformed the state and its voting patterns.\n\nThe combined total of Hispanics, blacks and Asians has outnumbered whites since 1998. Hispanics, who lean Democratic, surpassed whites as the state's largest racial or ethnic group in 2014.\n\nCalifornia Republicans have bickered for years over what direction to turn \u2014 toward the political center or to the right.\n\n\"The old way isn't working,\" the group says on its website. \"There's a new way that Republicans can gain relevance in California once again.\"\n\nParty conservatives have long chaffed at moving away from what they see as bedrock values. In 2011, for example, Republican moderates pushed changes to the state GOP platform that avoided any mention of overturning Roe v. Wade, and dropped a demand to end virtually all federal and state benefits for people who entered the U.S. illegally. The proposal failed.\n\nNew Way California was formed by Republican Assemblyman Chad Mayes, who was ousted as the party's Assembly leader after he worked with Democrats on climate change legislation.\n\n\"Republicans have failed to be able to reach out to average folks in California,\" Mayes, of Yucca Valley, said in January. \"They don't think we care about them.\"", "link": null, "source": "CBS News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kathryn Watson", "body": "The network backed by Charles and David Koch realizes 2018 will be a challenging environment \u2014 and they're going \"all in\" to defend their policy priorities and candidates who support them, to the likely tune of roughly $400 million.

Wynn, a casino mogul, was a major backer of Republican candidates.\n\nThe unspoken aspect of the challenging 2018 environment is President Trump, who continues to struggle with approval ratings lower than his recent predecessors at this point in their presidencies. The Koch brothers themselves declined to spend anything on the 2016 presidential race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. But that tone seems to have shifted since the 2016 election, and Koch-related entities are finding ways to work with the Trump administration. Marc Short, for instance, the White House's director of legislative affairs, previously worked in Koch world, at Freedom Partners.\n\nNow, they want to protect what they consider significant accomplishments in the administration, and work to further them.\n\nPart of that includes an infusion of up to $20 million on selling tax reform to the public \u2014 after already spending $20 million on passing the legislation Mr. Trump signed into law at the end of last year.\n\nOther than that, much of their spending strategy in 2018 has yet to be seen. But, it likely won't be focused on the upcoming primary races.\n\n\"Historically, we have not gotten involved with primaries,\" Phillips said.\n\nLeaders in the Koch network on Saturday were hesitant to share what specific requirements they might have for backing candidates, on immigration or any other policy area.

The memo, declassified by President Trump and released by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee Friday, outlines how Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants were obtained for former Trump campaign official Carter Page, and what relationship the Trump dossier compiled by former British intelligence officer\u00a0Christopher Steele\u00a0had with those FISA warrant applications.\n\nGowdy said the public will \"never know\" if the surveillance against Page was justified, saying the warrants relied on three pieces of information -- the dossier, a reference to a Yahoo News article and other information available to the FISA court judges who approved warrants.\n\nBut, Gowdy, the only Republican on the House Intelligence Committee who has seen the actual FISA warrant applications -- Nunes has not -- emphasized that the memo does not discredit special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling and any ties to Trump associates.\n\n\"Not to me, it doesn't, and I was pretty integrally involved in the drafting of it,\" Gowdy said, asked if the memo has an impact on the Russia probe. \"There is a Russia investigation without a dossier.\"\n\nThe dossier has \"nothing to do\" with the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr., Trump son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, and a Russian lawyer, Gowdy noted. Gowdy also said the dossier did not form the basis for the case against\u00a0George Papadopoulos, the former Trump campaign aid who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about foreign contacts. The dossier has nothing to do with obstruction of justice, Gowdy noted.\n\n\"So there's going to be a Russia probe, even without a dossier,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Gowdy said \"it would\" concern him if President Trump makes any move to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nThe South Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said he has confidence in the deputy attorney general, of whom Mr. Trump has been publicly critical, and he would be concerned if the commander-in-chief attempts to fire him.\n\n\"It would. Again, I'm not in the Senate. I don't have advice and consent. And the president has not sought my counsel on this,\" Gowdy told CBS News' White House and senior foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan.\n\nPressed as to whether he thinks Rosenstein should be fired, based on the information he has seen in compiling the memo, Gowdy said no.\n\n\"I don't,\" Gowdy said. \"I think it is fair to ask the deputy attorney general, what did you know at the time you signed one of the applications? I think it is fair to ask, what FISA reforms are you going to implement to make sure we don't have this fact pattern come up again? I don't judge people based on a single decision that they make throughout the course of an otherwise really stellar career.\"\n\nGowdy also expressed confidence in FBI Director Christopher Wray, whom President Trump selected to replace fired FBI Director James Comey last May.\n\n\"I've had my differences with Rod Rosenstein and I still think that he is fully capable of helping run a Justice Department that we can all have confidence in,\" Gowdy said. \"I'm actually really impressed with Chris Wray and I say that even though we are on totally opposite sides of this issue and probably will always be. He doesn't think the memo should have been publicly disseminated. I have real questions about the process that the bureau went through in 2016, but I also think he's the person to lead the bureau. I think he's doing a good job.\"\n\nGowdy went on to express his support for Mueller, whose investigation he said is independent.\n\n\"Well I'm actually in a really small group, I think, of Republicans that think that this FISA process is suspect and wrong and should not have taken place. But you still have a Russia investigation even without it,\" Gowdy said. \"So I don't know how many other Republicans feel that way. I am on record as saying I support Bob Mueller 100 percent. I think you would have a Russia -- look, Russia tried to interfere with our election in 2016 with or without a dossier. So you need an investigation into Russia. You need an investigation into the Trump Tower and the Cambridge Analytica email, separate and apart from the dossier. So those are not connected issues to me. They may be for Republicans, but they're not for me. I say investigate everything Russia did but admit that this was a really sloppy process that you engaged in to surveil a U.S. citizen.\"\n\nGowdy's claims would seem to conflict with Mr. Trump, who took to Twitter Saturday morning to claim the GOP memo \"totally vindicates 'Trump.'\" The president frequently describes the Russia probe as a \"witch hunt,\" and did so on Saturday morning.\n\nGowdy also opened up about his upcoming departure from Congress. His announcement that he would not run for reelection in 2018 sent shockwaves throughout Washington.\n\n\"You know, I'm just -- I enjoy the justice system more. I enjoy being fair,\" Gowdy said, explaining the reason for his departure. \"I enjoy the pursuit of fairness as a virtue and I'm just more comfortable in that system. My wife hates it when I say this but I was a pretty good prosecutor, I think. But I've been a pretty lousy politician. So, I've done it for seven years. I'm really grateful for the opportunity to do it but it's time for me to -- whatever time I've got left, I want to spend it in the justice system because that's where my heart is.\"\n\nYou can watch Gowdy's interview with Margaret Brennan on Sunday on \"Face the Nation\" (@FaceTheNation).

Near-final results released Monday showed that the other seven candidates were far behind Putin in Sunday's voting.\n\nObservers reported widespread ballot stuffing -- video emerged appearing to show people literally cramming ballots into boxes at polling stations, and there was unprecedented pressure on Russians to get out and vote.\n\nBut as CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reports, none of that is likely to have seriously altered the outcome of the vote. Nor are the reports of widespread fraud likely to seriously damage Putin's image, given his popularity and his tight control over Russian politics, and media. The outcome was never in doubt.\n\nWith 99.8 percent of the vote counted, the Central Election Commission said Monday that communist Pavel Grudinin came in a distant second with 11.8 percent. Third was ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky with 5.6 percent. The only candidate to openly criticize Putin during the campaign, liberal TV star Ksenia Sobchak, won just 1.6 percent.\n\nPutin's most serious rival, opposition leader Alexei Navalny, was barred from the race.\n\nThe electoral commission said official turnout was 67 percent, but the figure was thrown into question by images circulating online of ballot stuffing and nationwide accounts of workers being coerced to vote.\n\nRegardless, Putin now has a stronger hold on Russia -- and stronger place in the world -- thanks to the overwhelming mandate for yet another term as president.\n\nHis domestic opponents are largely resigned to another six years in the shadows. His foreign opponents are mired in their own problems, from Britain's messy exit from the European Union to chaos and contradiction in the Trump administration.\n\nThe accusations that he meddled in the U.S. election and sponsored a nerve agent attack in Britain have only bolstered his standing at home.\n\nPalmer reports that after his big win, President Putin directly addressed the accusation from Britain that he was behind the attack on Russian exile and former double agent Sergei Skripal, using a powerful Novichok chemical nerve agent.\n\nHe called the allegation rubbish. But his campaign spokesman actually thanked Britain for helping Putin win so many votes.\n\nIn London, U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on Monday called Russia's ongoing denials of culpability in the attack \"increasingly absurd,\" while in Moscow, a Kremlin spokesman said Britain would have to hand over its evidence \"sooner or later,\" or apologize for the accusation.\n\nWhenever Russia is accused of something, Palmer says, Russians unite around the center of their nation's power. For decades, that power has been embodied by Vladimir Putin, and for at least another term, it will continue to be.\n\nBelow is a look at what to expect from Putin's next six years in power, for Russia's rivals, neighbors and its own 147 million citizens.\n\nRelations between Russia and the West are already at their lowest level since the collapse of the Soviet Union 26 years ago.\n\nDespite a friendly-ish relationship with President Donald Trump, Putin's new mandate gives him little incentive to seek entente with Washington, especially as the investigation of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election intensifies.\n\nPutin-friendly leaders have made gains in recent Italian and German elections. Western countries are likely to see more Russia-linked hacking and propaganda aimed at disrupting elections or otherwise discrediting democracy -- including the U.S. midterm elections in November.\n\nSince Putin's domestic popularity bumps whenever he stands up to the West, expect more tough talk from Putin the next time he faces threats at home, and bolder Russian vetoes at the U.N. Security Council of anything seen as threatening Moscow's interests.\n\nHis claim several weeks ago that Russia has developed new nuclear weapons that can evade missile defenses clearly showed Putin's adamant determination to boost Russia's power to intimidate.\n\nRussian-backed Syrian forces helped rout the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) from Syria, and Putin argues that Russia saved the day in a conflict that had confounded U.S.-led forces fighting against ISIS.\n\nNow those Russian-backed Syrian forces are closing in on the last strongholds of Western-backed rebel forces.\n\nViewing that as a geopolitical and military victory over an illegal Western-led intervention, Russia is unlikely to pull out of Syria anytime soon.\n\nAn emboldened Putin could position the resurgent Russian military as a peacemaker in other regional conflicts -- for example in Libya, where Russia has oil interests and where a disastrous Western invasion seven years ago left a lawless state now seething with extremists.\n\nTo Russians, Putin's biggest victory in 18 years in power was annexing Crimea and crushing Ukraine's ambitions to move closer to the EU and NATO.\n\nPutin is frustrated at the resulting U.S. and EU sanctions but appears unwilling to make concessions that would bring them to an end. Ukraine is split between a volatile government in Kiev and a Russia-backed separatist region stuck in a frozen but still deadly conflict that serves Putin's interests.\n\nMoscow's actions in Ukraine sent a warning signal to other countries in Russia's orbit that reaching westward is dangerous. And former Soviet bloc states within the EU are increasingly drifting back toward Moscow, from Hungary and Poland to the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\nPutin's new mandate could theoretically hand him the power to make bold reforms that Russia has long needed to raise living standards and wean itself from its oil dependence.\n\nBut Putin has convinced Russian voters that drastic change is dangerous, and that protecting the country from threats takes precedence over improving daily life.\n\nExperts predict he may enact some changes like expanding affordable housing and fighting corruption on a local level.\n\nBut less likely are bigger changes such as overhauling the pension system, which is unpopular among a strong Putin voting base, or spending cuts in the security sector, unpopular among the ex-KGB friends in Putin's entourage.\n\nRussia has weathered a two-year recession, and inflation and the deficit are low. But personal incomes have stagnated, the health care system is crumbling and corruption is rife.\n\nThe biggest question for Russians over the next six years is what happens after that.\n\nPutin is constitutionally required to step down in 2024, but he could change the rules to eliminate term limits, or anoint a malleable successor and continue to run things behind the scenes.\n\nAsked at an impromptu news conference Sunday night if he would seek the presidency again in 2030, when he would be eligible again, the 65-year-old Putin snapped back: \"It's ridiculous. Do you think I will sit here until I turn 100?\"\n\nOpposition leader Alexei Navalny, Putin's most serious foe, will face further pressure from authorities as he works to expose corruption and official lies.\n\nOther Putin rivals such as candidate Ksenia Sobchak and oligarch-turned-dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky will try to gain a foothold through upcoming local elections and the parliament.\n\nAnd members of Putin's inner circle will be jockeying for position for the day when he is no longer in the picture.\n\nPutin may revive efforts to promote artificial intelligence and other innovation as part of a focus on the younger generation, whose loyalty he needs to ensure his legacy outlives him.", "link": null, "source": "CBS News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "", "body": "PATTAYA, Thailand -- A Belarusian woman jailed in Thailand for offering sex lessons without a work permit says she has a story to tell involving the Kremlin, Russian billionaires and even the president of the United States. Anastasia Vashukevich, whose extraordinary claims and racy selfies have propelled her to internet fame in recent weeks, told The Associated Press from a police van Wednesday that she fears for her life, and wants to exchange information on alleged Russian ties to Donald Trump's campaign for her own personal safety. But she refused for now to offer any such evidence, and it's not clear if she has any.\n\nVashukevich's story offers a glimpse into the shady world of Russian oligarchs. Mr. Trump's onetime campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, also had ties to that world through his consulting work for one of those oligarchs. Manafort has been indicted on money-laundering charges related to his overseas consulting work by special counsel Robert Mueller. But Mueller has offered no evidence that Manafort linked his Russian contacts to Mr. Trump's campaign or helped Russia meddle in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nThat has not stopped Vashukevich from claiming she has such evidence as she faces possible deportation.\n\nVashukevich shot to fame in early February when Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, one of President Vladimir Putin's top foes, published an investigation drawing on Vashukevich's social media posts suggesting corrupt links between billionaire Oleg Deripaska and a top Kremlin official, Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Prikhodko. The report featured video from Deripaska's yacht in 2016, when Vashukevich claims she was having an affair with him.\n\nRussians have focused on the ties between Deripaska and Prikhodko. But now Vashukevich says -- so far without proof -- that she can link the Kremlin to Mr. Trump and Manafort, who worked for Deripaska a decade before Mr. Trump hired him.\n\nEven Navalny told the AP on Wednesday he has \"certain doubts\" that Vashukevich has any evidence about alleged direct ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\n\"I think such statements are made because of fears for her own life because they have been detained in Thailand,\" he said, adding he believes her fears are well-founded.\n\nNavalny's report made no claim that Vashukevich knew anything about a Russian campaign to influence the U.S. election, and she has produced no evidence that she does.\n\nAs for her claims of Deripaska's ties to the Kremlin official, Deripaska called them nonsense when Navalny alleged them.\n\nIn an emailed response Feb. 8, Deripaska's spokesman said: \"These scandalous and mendacious assumptions are driven by sensationalism and we totally refute these outrageous false allegations in the strongest possible way.\"\n\nDeripaska sued Vashukevich and her \"sex guru,\" Alexander Kirillov, for breach of privacy. The Russian court imposed an injunction, and communications providers blocked access to Navalny's website for several weeks until he deleted the videos.\n\nA Feb. 15 statement from Deripaska said: \"Mr. Deripaska's claim is to protect his right to privacy and has nothing to do with any political struggle between Mr. Navalny and his political opponents.\"\n\nA request for comment Wednesday from the Russian government went unanswered.\n\nOn Sunday, Vashukevich was arrested along with nine other people, including Kirillov, in the Thai resort of Pattaya while giving sex lessons to Russian tourists. Immigration Police Maj. Satawat Srirattanapong said the 10 were charged with working without a permit, and one with having an expired visa.\n\nVashukevich said she won't give details of what she knows until she is guaranteed she won't be sent to Russia.\n\n\"I can say something only when I will be in a safe place, sorry, because I am worried about my life,\" Vashukevich told the AP from a police van that was taking the detainees from Pattaya to Bangkok's Immigration Detention Center.\n\nVashukevich had earlier posted a video on Instagram, also apparently made while in custody in Pattaya, addressed to \"Dear American media.\"\n\n\"I didn't want to tell you about many things. Now they're trying to lock us up,\" she said. \"But now I'm ready to put together all the pieces of the puzzle that you have been missing, and back it up with audio and video regarding the ties of our esteemed lawmakers with Manafort, Trump and all this buzz around the U.S. election. I know a lot.\"\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly denied that he colluded with Russia to influence the U.S. election.\n\nKirillov, the \"sex guru\" known in Russia for staging high-profile sexual happenings that usually involve sending scantily clad women out in public, told AP from the police van that the Russian government was behind their arrests.\n\n\"Political reasons. We know so much. So that's why they want us to go to Russia,\" he said. \"We think that in a few days, maybe even today, they will send us to Russia, very fast, and I think you will lose us, and never see us more.\"\n\nKirillov and Vashukevich have both recorded their activities on social media, with racy photos and videos taken in many countries. One of the tamer photos on Kirillov's feed shows him posing in front of Trump Tower in New York. Kirillov, who Thai police say is Russian, posts under the pseudonym Alex Lesley. Vashukevich, who is from Belarus, uses the name Nastya Rybka.\n\nThey were arrested in a hotel meeting room in Pattaya, a seaside resort noted for its sex industry and popularity with Russian visitors. The lessons were attended by about 40 Russian tourists, many wearing T-shirts bearing the English words \"Sex animator\" with an arrow pointing to the wearer's crotch. Thai news media cited police as saying that the meeting was raided because hotel staff reported hearing strange sounds.\n\nSatawat, the police major, said all 10 arrested people have had their visas revoked and will be detained at the Immigration Detention Center in Bangkok until the charges of working illegally are resolved. He said police have up to 48 days to process the cases before handing them to prosecutors. If they plead guilty, he said, their cases could end without trial and they could leave the country.\n\nCanceling a visa normally allows a country to expel a person without having to go through the legal process of extradition.\n\nPutin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied Wednesday that the Russians' case had anything to do with a visit to Thailand by Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev. He said Patrushev often makes overseas visits arranged in advance.\n\n\"It's ludicrous to link this to the detention of Russian nationals in Thailand,\" he said.\n\nNavalny said given recent events -- including a cocaine bust at the Russian Embassy in Argentina -- he wasn't so sure.\n\n\"I don't know what to think,\" Navalny told the AP. \"Shows like 'Homeland' begin to look entirely realistic when you look at what is happening in Russia now.

Under the deal, she is due to be released in the summer.\u00a0 She is also being fined the equivalent of about $1,400.\n\nLasky called the legal proceedings a \"farce.\" She said \"they are trying to deter other Palestinian youth from resisting occupation as Ahed did.\"\n\nThe judge agreed to a similar plea deal for Tamimi's mother Nariman, who has been charged with incitement.\n\n\"This is injustice, this court is designed to oppress the Palestinians,\" her father Bassem said. He said they agreed to the deal because they had been threatened with three years in jail. Bassem had visited his daughter and wife for the first time in prison the day before. He said Ahed spends her time doing school work.\n\nAn Israeli supporter of Tamimi slapped a prosecutor after the ruling and was later arrested by police.\n\nTamimi was arrested in December after video surfaced of her kicking the soldiers outside her West Bank home. While some praised the soldiers for showing restraint, hard-line politicians criticized what they felt was a weak response and called for tough action against the girl, whose family has a long history of run-ins with the Israelis.\n\nBut the full-throttle prosecution of Tamimi, who turned 17 behind bars, has drawn widespread international criticism. An Israeli official's revelation that he had once had parliament investigate whether the blond, blue-eyed Tamimis are \"real\" Palestinians drew accusations of racism and helped stoke additional interest in the case.\n\nThe case touches on what constitutes legitimate resistance to Israel's rule over millions of Palestinians, now in its 51st year, in territories it captured in the 1967 war.\n\n\"No justice under occupation and we are in an illegal court,\" Tamimi said to reporters in court.\n\nAhed Tamimi's supporters see a brave girl who struck the soldiers in anger after having just learned that Israeli troops seriously wounded a 15-year-old cousin, shooting him in the head from close range with a rubber bullet during nearby stone-throwing clashes.\n\nIn Israel, she is seen either as a naive youth manipulated by her elders or a threat to Israel's military deterrence. The incident also sparked debate about the soldiers' refusal to act.\n\nIsrael has treated Tamimi's actions as a criminal offense, indicting her on charges of assault and incitement that carry up to 14 years in prison.\n\nSince 2009, residents of Tamimi's village of Nabi Salah have staged regular anti-occupation protests that often end with stone-throwing clashes. Ahed Tamimi has participated in such marches from a young age, and has had several highly publicized run-ins with soldiers.\n\nOne photo shows the then-12- year-old raising a clenched fist toward a soldier towering over her.\n\nFollowing her latest arrest, images of the girl became popular on posters in the West Bank. Some 1.7 million people worldwide have signed a petition calling for her release.\n\nThe case has drawn attention to Israel's military court system, which is used to try Palestinians in the West Bank. Israeli West Bank settlers, on the other hand, are tried under Israeli civilian courts.\n\nThe dueling justice systems have drawn criticism from international rights groups. The military courts have a near 100 percent conviction rate, in part because so many Palestinians agree to plea bargains. Critics say the system gives Palestinians few rights, and they are often coerced into plea deals.

Mr. Trump has long been frustrated by the lengthy and intensifying probe, and insists his 2016 presidential campaign did not collude with Russia to influence the election in his favor.\n\n\"The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime,\" he said in a late Saturday tweet he ended with \"WITCH HUNT!\"\n\nLikely contributing to Mr. Trump's sense of frustration, The New York Times reported last week that Mueller had subpoenaed the Trump Organization for Russia-related documents. Mr. Trump had said Mueller would cross a red line with such a step.\n\n\"Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans?\" he tweeted Sunday.\n\nSome of Mueller's investigators indeed have contributed to Democratic political candidates, but Justice Department policy and federal service law bar discrimination in the hiring of career positions on the basis of political affiliation. Mueller is a Republican.\n\nThe tweets revived talk that Mr. Trump may, in an attempt to end the investigation, move to have Mueller fired.

He fumed to one confidant after seeing a promotion for a forthcoming book by James Comey, the FBI director he fired last year, believing Comey will seek to enrich himself by besmirching Mr. Trump's reputation. Comey's yet-to-be-published book, \"A Higher Loyalty,\" topped Amazon.com's best-seller list on Sunday.\n\nThe president also has long been torn over how to approach the probe. His legal team, namely Cobb, has counseled Mr. Trump to cooperate with Mueller.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump ally.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., called for the passage of bipartisan bills designed to protect Mueller that have stalled in Congress.\n\n\"This president is engaged in desperate and reckless conduct to intimidate his law enforcement agencies of this country and to try and stop the special counsel.

Mr. Trump asserted without elaboration that McCabe knew \"all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!\"\n\nThe Associated Press later reported that McCabe kept personal memos detailing interactions with Mr. Trump that have been provided to Mueller's office and are similar to notes compiled by Comey. Mr. Trump sought to cast doubt on their veracity, tweeting Sunday that he spent \"very little time\" with McCabe \"but he never took notes when he was with me.\"\n\n\"I don't believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date.

They were looking to build a dynasty, and were ruthless in the pursuit of that goal. While exhibiting the glamour of a great family, they were at heart arrivistes, and refused to adhere to patrician rules of political conduct.\n\nBut once in power, the Kennedys were interested not in tearing down establishment institutions, but in coopting and leading them.

Few, it seems, have a firm grasp on what is happening, let alone what might happen next. Everybody, regardless of their ideology, thinks they're losing. A realignment appears to be happening in our politics, but nobody can agree on what it looks like. \"We all feel the fault lines of a fractured country,\" as Joe III put it in his stilted, awkward speech on Tuesday night.\n\nA side effect of that realignment, at least in the short term, is that liberals are sounding more conservative in certain respects. They relentlessly defend the FBI, the CIA, the military. They rail against the threat posed by Russia. They look to Robert Mueller, a career national security bureaucrat, to save the country from Trump. They're even keen to ally with proponents of American military adventurism abroad, namely Trump's neoconservative critics like Bill Kristol.\n\nThere is, of course, an element of nostalgia in liberalism's newfound fondness for our institutions. Trump-era liberalism, with its emphasis on American global leadership and veneration of federal agencies and the mainstream press, would be easily recognizable to that first generation of Kennedys. And in that sense, it makes sense that Joe III would become a natural face of contemporary Democratic politics.\n\nTuesday night was an attempt to make Joe III a symbol of institutional resistance to Trump. To the question of whether the institutions are worth saving, and therefore capable of reform, Joe III's answer is an enthusiastic yes. He is, in a sense, already a symbol of how his own family has repaired itself from its reckless, impulsive, and selfish ways; he seems serious, he is sober. The message he sends is that his family, his party, and all the other institutions that nurtured him still have an innate and positive utility, an essential role to play. Where Trump says the rot must be amputated, Joe III promises that a strong dose of antibiotics is all that's needed.\n\nWhether this message resonates among the Democratic rank-and-file is another story. While the liberal commentariat, Joe III's natural constituency, remains fixated on norms and the need to defend institutions, a newly ascendant left sees civility as a neoliberal plot to uphold the status quo. And whereas Joe III and his ilk see Trump as an aberration, the left sees him as a symptom of a decayed political order they wish to abolish and replace.\n\nRobert Kennedy once said that he wished he had been born poor so he could have been a revolutionary. As his career advances, Joe III might harbor a similar desire, if only because his party is increasingly moving in a revolutionary direction.", "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/commentary-joe-kennedys-night-in-the-sun/", "source": "CBS News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Katiana Krawchenko", "body": "Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Ben Ray Lujan is predicting his party's candidate, Conor Lamb, will triumph in the special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district\u00a0Tuesday, launching a \"tide-turning moment\" for the historically Republican district.\n\n\"I think a loud message has already been sent,\" Lujan told CBS News Chief White House Correspondent Major Garrett on the latest episode of \"The Takeout\" podcast.\n\nThat message to the Republican in the race, Rick Saccone, and the GOP more broadly, he explained, became clear last week.\n\n\"The observation there that's been interesting especially when it comes to the tax debate in the country,\" Lujan noted, \"is Republicans were sending millions of dollars attacking Conor Lamb on this tax package and his tax message.

Besides the messaging, though, Lamb is an appealing candidate. The 32-year-old former Marine has been a federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's office.

The tariffs will be 10 percent for aluminum and 25 percent for steel, and they'll go into effect next week for an unlimited amount of time.\n\nMr. Trump summoned steel and aluminum executives to the White House on Thursday amid speculation he may impose tariffs or quotas on steel and aluminum imports.\n\nPlans for Trump to make an announcement were thrown into doubt amid internal wrangling over the decision. Some White House officials, including chief of staff John Kelly, were not fully briefed on the Commerce Department's plans, according to a senior administration official familiar with the process. This official was not authorized to publicly discuss the internal deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe possibility of an announcement, on an issue overseen by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, caught some top White House officials off guard and left several aides scrambling for details.\n\nKey Senate offices also did not receive advanced warning that Trump was expected to announce a decision before April deadlines.\n\nTrump was scheduled to meet with more than a dozen executives, including representatives from U.S. Steel Corp., Arcelor Mittal, Nucor, JW Aluminum and Century Aluminum.\n\nIncreased foreign production, especially by China, has driven down prices and hurt American producers, creating a situation the Commerce Department says poses a national security threat.\n\nTrump tweeted Thursday that many U.S industries, including steel and aluminum \"have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and SMART TRADE!\"\n\nThe president had until April 11 to make a decision on steel, and until April 19 to decide about aluminum.\n\nThe decision to impose tariffs is likely to escalate simmering tensions with China and other U.S. trading partners. Critics of such a move fear that other countries will retaliate or use national security as a pretext to impose trade penalties of their own. They also argue that sanctions on imports will drive up prices and hurt U.S. automakers and other companies that use steel or aluminum.\n\nThe Commerce Department recommended tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, higher tariffs on imports from specific countries or a quota on imports.\n\nRoss last month offered the president three options:\n\nMr. Trump last year ordered an investigation into whether aluminum and steel imports posed a threat to national defense. Ross said last month that the imports \"threaten to impair our national security,\" noting, for example, that only one U.S. company now produces a high-quality aluminum alloy needed for military aircraft.\n\nSection 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 gives the president authority to restrict imports and impose unlimited tariffs if a Commerce Department investigation finds a national security threat.", "link": null, "source": "CBS News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kathryn Watson", "body": "President Trump is hosting the Public Safety Medal of Valor Awards Ceremony Wednesday afternoon at the White House, in his first public appearance in Washington since his brief speech Thursday after the Parkland shooting.\n\nMr. Trump will be recognizing those who have earned the highest possible valor award for public safety, in an honor that the president or vice president typically gives according to the Justice Department.

The decision had been ushered into law as an executive order even before Tillerson had been confirmed in February 2017. The White House spokesperson at the time, Sean Spicer, said State Department employees should \"either get with the program or they can go.\"\n\nThe situation pitted the White House against the State Department and the State Department against Tillerson, who was planning to retire as Exxon-Mobile's CEO when Mr. Trump tapped him to become America's top diplomat. Tillerson had no formal diplomatic experience, and aware of the discord in the department he was about to lead,\u00a0he immediately tried to mend fences.\n\nOn his first day at Foggy Bottom, Tillerson sheepishly introduced himself as \"the new guy\" in a speech to department staff. He knew that many of the people he was addressing had worked for Mr. Trump's election opponent, Hillary Clinton, when she was Secretary of State.\n\n\"Each of us is entitled to the expression of our political beliefs, but we cannot let our personal convictions overwhelm our ability to work as one team,\" Tillerson said at the time.\n\nBut team building was of secondary importance. First he had to endear himself to Mr. Trump, with whom he did not have a close relationship. Over the course of his tenure, Tillerson, who abides by the old western philosophy \"my word is my bond,\" spent a lot of his energy courting the president. It ended up being a go-nowhere effort that ended when Tillerson was sacked on Tuesday.\n\n\"He had to make Trump believe he was on his team, that he wasn't from the State Department where they thought everyone hated Trump,\" explained a State official. To that end, he had lunch with Mr. Trump weekly, talked with him on the phone most days, and tried to put in as much face-time as possible with the new president.\n\nYet they never really developed a rapport. The two men had marked differences in style, and policy differences became steadily more apparent. And then there was Jared Kushner: the president's top adviser and son-in-law, who quickly developed his own diplomatic profile.\n\nLike Tillerson, Kushner lacked a diplomatic background. Yet he quickly became the White House's point man on international issues ranging from the Middle East peace process to relations with Mexico and China. Friction was inevitable. Tillerson told Kushner the Chinese were duping him, souring their relationship further.\n\nTillerson, an engineer by training, was meticulous, a quality that ran counter to Mr. Trump's speedy entrepreneurial approach to most issues. They could never see eye-to-eye on perhaps the most pressing diplomatic concern, which was North Korea's nuclear program. Mr. Trump even embarrassed Tillerson on Twitter when he told him to \"stop wasting his time\" seeking a negotiated solution to the impasse -- at the time Tillerson was in the region.\n\nAnd Tillerson never completely followed Mr. Trump's lead. A week before he was fired, Tillerson told reporters that negotiations with North Korea were a long ways off. Later that same day Trump, accepted a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. When that surprise announcement came, Tillerson was sure to air a dose of skepticism, saying that the speed of Kim Jong Un's change in posture \"came as a little bit of a surprise.\" And Tillerson also warned of a victory lap: the regime had not reached out to confirm the meeting.\n\nMr. Trump and Tillerson had different methods to approaching almost every diplomatic challenge, which led to a series of policy disagreements between the two. They sparred over quitting the Paris Climate agreement, how to handle the Qatar blockade, how much to initially press for diplomacy with North Korea, and on Trump's instinct to ditch the Iran Nuclear Deal altogether.\n\n\"He and I have differences of views on things like [the Iran Deal] and how we should use it,\" Tillerson said last summer. \"But, I think, if we're not having those differences, I'm not sure I'm serving him.\"\n\nYet those initial differences on the Iran deal helped spur reporting of Tillerson's departure. Those rumors \u2013 perpetuated by Tillerson's opponents at the White House \u2013 remained in the Washington wind, with differing levels of intensity, until Tillerson's final day.\n\nTillerson spent his time fighting off the rumors of his impending departure. He called them \"ridiculous\" and tried to massage tensions with Mr. Trump. \"I'm not going anywhere,\" Tillerson said in response to a question from CBS News in July 2017, when he had only been on the job for 6 months.\n\nMeanwhile, State Department employees grew increasingly unhappy. By the time he left, Tillerson still hadn't filled seven of the top nine positions at the department. And the feeling of being sidelined, as foreign policy decisions were largely made within the walls of the White House, mounted among diplomats.\n\nForeign leaders and diplomats called the White House when they needed to get something done. In light of the administration's proposal to cut 30 percent of the State Department's budget, the former oil giant's plans to restructure the department, which he said were designed to make it more efficient, started to seem like an excuse to lay off experienced diplomats.\n\nTillerson, initially, did himself no favors with the State Department's staff. On his first few international trips, he did not visit U.S. embassy personnel. His recruited a team around him of State Department outsiders. He once told foreign service officers that he had no knowledge of how the State Department worked before getting there. He admitted, almost a year into the job, that he had not done enough to explain the purpose of the department overhaul to staffers.\n\nTillerson's was not without some accomplishments. In early 2017, he was able to convince the Trump administration to remove Iraq from the travel ban list in return for Iraq agreeing to open diplomatic conversation with the Saudis. But he did not want to call attention to incremental successes. At one point, he said the State Department hadn't put any \"wins on the board.\" A former aide explained that, for Tillerson, a real win would only be something monumental, like getting North Korea to denuclearize.\n\nAs a result of his reluctance to talk up his smaller victories coupled with fears of infuriating the White House, Tillerson primarily got attention through his attempts to save his relationship with Trump. When reports broke over the summer that Tillerson had called Mr. Trump a \"moron,\" there was a last-minute news conference at the State Department. Tillerson called Trump \"smart,\" but never denied that he had made the comments. Shortly after that, Mr. Trump told reporters he would like Tillerson to be a \"little tougher.\"\n\nTheir relationship would never really improve, leading Mr. Trump to unceremoniously fire Tillerson on Twitter. In his outgoing remarks that afternoon, Tillerson thanked State Department personnel and Department of Defense counterparts, but notably he never mentioned the Mr. Trump by name.\n\n\"I'll now return to private life as a private citizen, as a proud American, proud of the opportunity I've had to serve my country,\" Tillerson said.

Organizers of the March for Our Lives rally are hoping to draw 500,000 protesters; that would match last year's women's march and make this one of the largest Washington protests since the Vietnam era. It would also bolster claims that the nation is ready to enact sweeping changes to its gun control laws.\n\nMore than 800 marches are planned in cities across America and dozens of locations overseas to be held at roughly the same time.\n\nWashington is generally nonchalant about protests, but Saturday's gathering has prompted more attention and speculation than usual. Police are bracing for the hundreds of thousands expected to gather for the rally, CBS News' Jeff Pegues reports. Washington officials say they are prepared to handle the crowds -- more prepared than they were for the women's march, which far exceeded the organizers' official predictions of 300,000.\n\nThe protesters, many of them high school students, claim that the youth leadership of this initiative is what will set it apart from previous attempts to enact stronger gun-control legislation.\n\nIn the wake of the Feb. 14 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the students have tapped into a powerful current of pro-gun control sentiment that has been building for years. They have also partnered with well-funded liberal groups such as Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun control advocacy group founded by former New York mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg.\n\nPolls indicate that public opinion nationwide may indeed be shifting on an issue that has simmered for generations, and through dozens of mass shootings. A recent CBS News poll found that nearly two-thirds of Americans support stricter laws on gun sales, including an increasing number of Republicans. Sixty-five percent of Americans said as of late February that laws covering the sale of guns should be stricter -- an eight-point increase from December.\n\nAlso, a new poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 69 percent of Americans think gun laws in the United States should be tightened. That's up from 61 percent who said the same in October of 2016 and 55 percent when the AP first asked the question in October of 2013. Overall, 90 percent of Democrats, 50 percent of Republicans and 54 percent of gun owners now favor stricter gun control laws.\n\nBut even with claims of historic social momentum on the issue of gun control, the AP poll also found that nearly half of Americans do not expect elected officials to take action. The CBS News poll found that most Americans who support such stricter gun laws -- 59 percent -- are pessimistic about the prospect of the president and Congress enacting them in the near future.

What if there really is no collusion?\n\nIn one sense, the question is irrelevant: Paul Manafort is facing serious money-laundering charges that could land him in jail for 305 years; Gen.

He will have turned out to be right, no matter how many other things he did wrong.\n\nI believe this is the reason Trump stepped on his own good news regarding the McCabe firing.\u00a0 Why he didn't do what many (myself included) considered the smart move: Let McCabe's firing speak for itself.\u00a0 Why he sent out his first-ever tweet attacking special counsel Robert Mueller using the key word: \"collusion:\"\n\n\"The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime,\" he wrote Sunday. \"It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign.

The proposal wasn't controversial until Delta announced last weekend it would no longer offer discounted fares to NRA members.\n\n\"I hope they are better at flying airplanes than timing P.R. announcements,\" Georgia House Speaker David Ralston, a Republican, said after his chamber gave final approval to a larger tax-cut bill that was stripped of the jet fuel tax exemption.\n\nThe Feb. 14 slayings of 17 students and educators in Parkland, Florida, by a gunman armed with an AR-15 assault-style rifle has prompted retailers including Walmart, Kroger and Dick's Sporting Goods to tighten their gun sales policies. Meanwhile, Delta and other companies including MetLife and Hertz have ended business ties with the NRA.\n\nDelta's decision triggered a showdown with pro-gun lawmakers in Georgia, where the Atlanta-based airline is one of the largest employers with 33,000 employees statewide. Republican Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, the state Senate's presiding officer, vowed Monday to stop any tax break that would benefit Delta.\n\n\"Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,\" tweeted Cagle, who is also running for governor.\n\nGOP lawmakers amended a sweeping tax bill to eliminate a fuel-tax exemption worth at least an estimated $38 million to Delta and other airlines.\n\nThe Senate passed the tax measure 44-10, with Democrats accounting for all the no votes. The House - which had passed an earlier version with the jet fuel exemption before the Delta controversy erupted - followed with a 135-24 vote.\n\nRepublican Gov. Nathan Deal criticized the Delta controversy as an \"unbecoming squabble\" but said he would sign the broader tax measure in whatever form it passed.\n\nDelta did not immediately return messages seeking comment Thursday. NRA spokeswoman Catherine Mortensen had no immediate comment.\n\nThe Delta provision barely came up Thursday in either legislative chamber during debate on the underlying tax bill, designed in part to give back to Georgia taxpayers $5.2 billion in extra state revenue expected over the next five years because of the recent federal tax overhaul.\n\n\"Obviously the political environment does sometimes get a little testy, but in the end, it's all about the product,\" said Cagle, who is running this year to succeed the term-limited governor. \"And the product we have today is something that all of us can be very proud of.\"\n\nGOP Sen. Michael Williams, another gubernatorial candidate, praised Republicans for holding out in the face of criticism from the news media and corporate America.\n\n\"We've stayed strong,\" Williams said. \"We've even stayed strong against our own governor.\"\n\nAmong Democrats voting against the tax bill was Sen. Nikema Williams of Atlanta, who applauded companies that have taken swift action on guns after the Florida tragedy. She said Delta's decision to end its NRA discounts led her to support the jet fuel tax break.\n\n\"The small steps that Delta and Dick's Sporting Goods are taking, to take a stand and say enough is enough, is what we all need to be doing as adults,\" Williams said. \"We're the leaders of this state and we need to be coming together for solutions, not bullying corporations who are trying to do the right thing.\"\n\nCritics of the GOP effort to retaliate against Delta have warned it could backfire by harming Georgia's ability to lure businesses - including Amazon, which recently named Atlanta a finalist in its search for a second headquarters.\n\n\"It definitely could have an effect when an outside company looks at something that happens this quickly around election time to one of the largest employers in the state,\" said William Hatcher, a professor at Augusta University who studies economic development. \"But will it be the dominant factor?

Reports of tumult in the administration were at a feverish pitch \u2014 even on his beloved Fox News \u2014 as the president reflected on the latest staff departures during an Oval Office conversation with Vice President Mike Pence and Chief of Staff John Kelly.\n\nWith a laugh, Mr. Trump said: \"Who's next?\"\n\nIt's the very question that has the whole White House on edge.\n\nIn recent weeks, the president's top economic adviser has resigned over a policy dispute, the secretary of state he long clashed with was fired and a slew of top aides headed for the exits. An increasingly confident Mr. Trump is privately weighing still more changes, expressing frustration with certain advisers and sifting through possible replacements.\n\nMany close to Mr. Trump think more upheaval is coming soon. The president is moving toward replacing national security adviser H.R. McMaster, but has not settled on exact timing or a successor, said four people with knowledge of White House deliberations. Kelly has also worn on the president, confidants of the president said. And Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, under fire for ethics violations, appears to be grasping to keep his job.\n\nSo intense was the swirl of speculation about McMaster that White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders tried to tamp things down late Thursday by tweeting: \"Just spoke to @POTUS and Gen. H.R. McMaster - contrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC.\"\n\nThis account of the tensions in the White House is based on conversations with 10 officials inside the White House and familiar with West Wing deliberations, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters.\n\nAfter more than 14 months in office, Mr. Trump is reshaping his administration, seeking people more likely to fall in line with his policies and tolerate his moods. The factionalism that defined the early days of his tenure has faded and he has lost some of the close aides who could manage his volatile impulses. To some, the White House is increasing taking on the feel of a team of cheerleaders more than a team of rivals.\n\nWhile dismissing news reports of looming departures, Trump also appeared to signal more changes to come on Thursday, telling reporters: \"There will always be change.\"\n\nMr. Trump's administration has set records for turnover among senior administration aides. Top economic adviser Gary Cohn and communications director Hope Hicks are leaving the White House in coming weeks. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was just unceremoniously ousted, on Twitter. And junior-level aides were particularly troubled by the abrupt exit of Mr. Trump's personal assistant John McEntee this week, who was removed from his job and escorted off White House grounds \u2014 then quickly handed a job on Mr. Trump's re-election campaign.\n\nIn private conversations in recent weeks with aides and friends, Mr. Trump has reflected on his desire to reshape the administration. Though the drumbeat of the ongoing Russia probe has only grown louder, the president believes that his recent decisions on tariffs and North Korea have breathed new life into his administration, and he is eager to take more \"bold steps\" that make his own mark. He has told confidants he wants to rid himself of staffers who hold him back.\n\nMr. Trump chafes at McMaster's demeanor, complaining that his aide lectures him, according to three current and former administration officials. Officials said McMaster has been sidelined in some internal discussions, with Kelly taking on a more active role in foreign policy decisions, because of the personal tensions.\n\nThe president and McMaster have disagreed on a number of issues \u2014 including the Iran deal and the U.S. approach to North Korea \u2014 and the national security adviser has also clashed with Kelly and Defense Secretary James Mattis, according to the officials.\n\nMcMaster, in turn, is not a natural fit for the scattershot policy-making process in the White House and dislikes the internal rivalries that so often divide the West Wing. He was the target of online attacks from the fringes of the right wing last summer, including for his alleged insufficient support of Israel.\n\nDuring an earlier round of Trump discontent with his national security adviser, there was White House talk of providing McMaster, a three-star general, with a soft landing by giving him a fourth star along with a command in a priority area such as Afghanistan or Korea, according to a former senior administration official.\n\nKelly has been credited with imposing order on the chaotic West Wing, but his relationship with Mr. Trump has come under strain too.\n\nMr. Trump was said to be deeply irritated and to have considered firing Kelly over the negative publicity surrounding his handling of the controversy over ousted White House aide Rob Porter, who was accused of domestic abuse. The president also recently told an ally that he was still frustrated by an interview that Kelly gave to Fox News nearly two months ago in which he suggested that Trump had \"evolved\" in his thinking about the need for a wall on the Mexican border.\n\nAt least one of Mr. Trump's \"generals\" \u2014 the collection of military advisers he used to boast about \u2014 remains largely in good standing. The president is said to remain pleased with Mattis, as the defense secretary rarely publicly disagrees with Mr. Trump and has succeeded in quietly working through any differences, according to three White House officials and outside advisers.\n\nMr. Trump has expressed frustration with aides whom he believes try to \"manage\" him according to several current and former White House officials \u2014 and has grown tired of efforts by his staff to stall controversial actions they disagree with. Trump, the officials said, wants a lively discussion \u2014 he often talks about enjoying conflict among his aides \u2014 but has grown irritated that some try to undermine his decisions.\n\nAs the president reshapes his administration, those who are taking over some of the vacated administration jobs tend to have closer ties to the president and signal more willingness to buy into his ways.\n\nTrump's nominee to be the next secretary of state \u2014CIA director Mike Pompeo \u2014 is a longtime favorite of the president who has demonstrated rare ability to navigate the West Wing. A campaign supporter of Mr. Trump's, Pompeo developed a strong personal relationship with the president by regularly attending his daily intelligence briefing.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump has known his pick to replace Cohn for decades.

The vote was tainted by widespread reports of ballot-box stuffing and forced voting, but the complaints will likely do little to undermine Putin.\n\nThe Russian leader's popularity remains high despite his suppression of dissent and reproach from the West over Russia's increasingly aggressive stance in world affairs and alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nPutin's main challenges in the vote were to obtain a huge margin of victory in order to claim an indisputable mandate. The Central Elections Commission said Putin had won about 72 percent of the vote, based on a count of 22 percent of the country's precincts.\n\nRussian authorities had sought to ensure a large turnout to bolster the image that Putin's so-called \"managed democracy\" is robust and offers Russians true choices.\n\nCBS News' Elizabeth Palmer\u00a0called the race an exercise in \"managed democracy.\" Putin faced seven minor candidates on the ballot. There was one man who might have given Putin a run for his money in this election:\u00a0Alexei Navalny, an anti-corruption activist who was harassed in the run-up to the election. He was ultimately barred from the race.\n\nThe election came amid escalating tensions between Russia and the West, with reports that Moscow was behind the nerve-agent poisoning of a former Russian double agent in Britain and that its internet trolls had mounted an extensive campaign to undermine the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Britain and Russia last week announced diplomat expulsions over the spy case and the United States issued new sanctions.\n\nRussian officials denounced both cases as efforts to interfere in the Russian election. But the disputes likely worked in Putin's favor, reinforcing the official contention that the West is infected with \"Russophobia\" and is determined to undermine Putin and Russian cultural values.\n\nPutin has come to embody Russia's exceptionalism, the sense of the state and culture as an extraordinary entity that is nonetheless under constant attack from outside.\n\nThe election took place on the fourth anniversary of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, one of the most dramatic manifestations of Putin's drive to reassert Russia's power.\n\nCrimea and Russia's subsequent support of separatists in eastern Ukraine led to an array of U.S. and European sanctions that, along with falling oil prices, damaged the Russian economy and slashed the ruble's value by half. But Putin's popularity remained strong, apparently buttressed by nationalist pride.\n\nIn his next six years in office, Putin is likely to assert Russia's power abroad even more strongly. Just weeks before the election, he announced that Russia has developed advanced nuclear weapons capable of evading missile defenses. The military campaign in Syria is clearly aimed at strengthening Russia's foothold in the Middle East and Russia eagerly eyes possible reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula as a lucrative economic opportunity.\n\nAt home, he will be faced with how to groom a successor or devise a strategy to circumvent term limits, how to drive diversification in an economy still highly dependent on oil and gas and how to improve medical care and social services in regions of the sprawling country far removed from the modern glitter of Moscow.\n\nCasting his ballot in Moscow, Putin was confident of victory, saying he would consider any percentage of votes a success.\n\n\"The program that I propose for the country is the right one,\" he declared.", "link": null, "source": "CBS News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jacqueline Alemany", "body": "President Trump, who once called New Hampshire a \"drug infested den,\" will travel to the primary state for the first time Monday since the 2016 campaign to unveil his plan to combat the opioid crisis that is killing more than 115 people every day.\n\nThe president's plan is focused on reducing drug demand, preventing over-prescription by cutting opioid prescriptions by one-third nationwide within three years, calls on Congress to reduce the amount of drugs needed to invoke mandatory minimum sentences for opioid traffickers and urges the Department of Justice to seek the death penalty against drug traffickers in certain cases, according to assistant to the president Andrew Bremberg.\n\nBremberg, who briefed reporters on a conference call in advance of Mr. Trump's announcement, could not name specific instances where it would be appropriate for the DOJ to seek the death penalty against drug traffickers and referred reporters to the DOJ.\n\nKellyanne Conway, who was also on the call, called the opioid crisis a non-partisan \"crisis next door\" and said resolving the epidemic is a priority for the administration.

If you are allowed to carry a concealed weapon in your home state, you would be allowed to carry it in all of them.\n\nThe Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act has already sailed through the House of Representatives and has the full support of President Trump. It has roughly 40 co-sponsors in the Senate where a showdown is shaping up between the gun lobby and law enforcement over states' rights and the second amendment.\n\nThis is the handgun counter at Van's Sporting Goods outside Jackson, Mississippi, a state with the fourth highest gun fatality rate in the country and some of the weakest gun laws.\n\nPretty much anyone 18 years of age and not a convicted felon can carry one of these concealed weapons here in their pocket, their pants or their purse for self-defense against muggers, carjackers and other assailants.\n\nIf the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act becomes law, they'll be able to carry them legally across state lines and onto the streets of any city in America.\n\nTim Schmidt: I think the aim of this bill is to simply allow responsibly armed Americans to-- to be able to travel and-- and-- and continue to defend their families.\n\nTim Schmidt is president and founder of the United States Concealed Carry Association. Along with the National Rifle Association and other gun-rights groups, they have successfully sold the bill in conservative red states as a simple, common sense solution to a hodgepodge of confusing, contradictory state laws they say infringe upon Americans' rights to bear arms.\n\nTim Schmidt: These laws change on a quarterly basis, if not more often. So you can easily go from being a responsibly armed citizen, who's 100 percent legal, to being a criminal just by crossing state lines.\n\nBut there is fierce opposition to it in places like California, where there are strict gun laws and concealed carry permits are difficult to obtain. It's one of eight states that generally require thorough background checks, at least some firearms training and a proven need to carry a handgun. In another 30 states, it's easier to get a concealed carry permit and in many of those, there's no requirement to be proficient in the use of firearms. A dozen states have no requirements at all.\n\nRobyn Thomas, the executive director of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, says forcing states to accept any and all gun permits would make the weakest laws in the country the new norm.\n\nRobyn Thomas: Someone who lives in Nevada, who's able to carry a loaded, concealed weapon in Nevada could now bring that loaded gun into Los Angeles, into San Francisco, and carry their loaded weapon, even though in San Francisco that's not someone who would get a permit.\n\nSteve Kroft: So this law would essentially usurp the gun laws in cities like New York and Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\nTo blue state liberals who favor gun control, it may sound like a right-wing fantasy but to the National Rifle Association, which contributed 30 million dollars to Donald Trump's presidential campaign and claims credit for his victory, it's their top legislative priority. And with midterm elections this year, nothing is taken for granted. In 2013, a similar bill failed by just three votes.\n\nThe NRA declined to give us an interview for this story but its position is well-documented on its website. This is the voice of its leader Wayne LaPierre, right after the last election.\n\nWayne LaPierre (Soundbite from \"Our Time is Now\", Date: 12/19/2016): This is our historic moment, to go on offense and defeat the forces that have aligned against our freedom once and for all. I call on Congress and the president-elect to pass national right to carry reciprocity as quickly as it can be written and signed. The individual right to carry a firearm in defense of our lives and our families does not and should not end at any state line.\n\nAs proof of injustice, the NRA and other gun rights advocates use the case of Shaneen Allen as ammunition.\n\nIn 2013, while driving from Philadelphia to Atlantic City, New Jersey, the single mother and mugging victim was pulled over with a pistol in her purse and a valid concealed carry permit from her home state of Pennsylvania.\n\nRep. Richard Hudson, House Floor, 12/6/2017: \"Let me tell you a story.\"\n\nCongressman Richard Hudson of North Carolina, who authored the House version of the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, told Allen's story on the day the House passed the bill.\n\nRep. Richard Hudson: What she didn't know is that New Jersey didn't recognize Pennsylvania's concealed carry permit. So this single mom who had never had a run-in with the law spent almost two months in jail and was facing ten years in prison because she'd crossed that state line.\n\nSteve Kroft: How was the case finally adjudicated?\n\nRep. Richard Hudson: Governor Chris Christie stepped in and pardoned her-- otherwise, like I say, she was facing ten years in prison.\n\nSteve Kroft: How often does that happen?\n\nRep. Richard Hudson: Well, it-- once is too much. These are law-abiding citizens, these are not the problem.\n\nThe large constituency for this message is a long way from the New Jersey Turnpike, in the red states that stretch from the Carolinas through the mountains of the far west. It is the political fault line of regional and cultural differences that split the country and guns are one of the triggers. They're woven into the culture here, passed down from generation to generation in rural, remote parts of the country where dialing 911 does not always bring immediate help. To people here, whether they're single mothers worried about robbers and rapists while driving their kids across state lines to soccer matches, or ranchers worried about rattlesnakes, guns are a security blanket of self-reliance and protection that keep them safe.\n\nScott Yarbro: For me, it's just a way of life. It's like when I get up in the morning and I get dressed, I get my wallet, I get my watch, I get my keys, I get my phone. It's the same thing to get my gun.\n\nBut in most big cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C. and New York, \u00a0guns are a cause of fear and concern, not comfort. And law enforcement has lined up against strangers from far away places walking around their cities with loaded guns in violation of their own laws.\n\nCyrus Vance: I think it would be a disaster for New York City. And I think for major cities around the country.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance and New York City Police Commissioner James O'Neill say their city has the most to lose. Every year, New York takes in nearly 50 million visitors from all over the country into a congested, sometimes chaotic city. Even if a tiny fraction were legally carrying concealed weapons, it would mean hundreds of thousands of additional guns for what is right now the safest big city in America.\n\nCyrus Vance: You bring that kind of volume of firepower even with well-intentioned people-- it's gonna be extremely dangerous.\n\nSteve Kroft: More guns, more violence. That's what you're saying.\n\nThey're not just worried about more crime, but an increase in suicides, gun accidents and heated arguments turning into lethal altercations. And with no national database for concealed carry permits, the NYPD says it would not be able to immediately determine whether someone was legally carrying or not.\n\nJames O'Neill: Right now we-- we have a good idea of-- of who's carrying guns. If this law passes, the-- all bets are off. Anybody can come into New York City from any state and-- and carry a weapon.\n\nCyrus Vance: I wouldn't presume to tell the residents of West Virginia what their gun laws should be. They've figured out what they want there. But I don't think they, or Congress, should be having West Virginia's laws put on New York City.\n\nCyrus Vance at press conference: The people who are strongest against this bill are law enforcement.\n\nVance and O'Neill have established a formidable coalition of prosecutors and police chiefs from nearly every big city in America to lobby senators to keep the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act from becoming law.\n\nSteve Kroft: Representative Hudson, there's huge opposition to this bill, among police departments in major cities in the United States-- Houston. Tucson. Metropolitan DC. Boston. New York City. Baltimore. Seattle. These are all cities where the chief of police has come out against this law. I can-- there are more, if you want me to read more.\n\nRep. Richard Hudson: Sure. Well, look--\n\nSteve Kroft: Now how do you explain that?\n\nRep. Richard Hudson: There are folks on both sides of the argument-- and I think good folks on both sides, who are honestly trying to protect their citizens. I just disagree with the conclusions\u2014\n\nSteve Kroft: So you're saying New York or Los Angeles or Chicago big cities have no right to pass any laws that regulate who can carry-- a weapon.\n\nRep. Richard Hudson: These cities and these states can still continue to have whatever laws they want to protect their citizens.\n\nSteve Kroft: Except they can't have a law that prohibits someone from carrying a concealed weapon?\n\nRep. Richard Hudson: Right. Just like a driver's license. You can't say you can't drive here --\n\nSteve Kroft: It's not just like a driver's license. Because to get a driver's license, you have to demonstrate a proficiency and-- and establish that you're not going to endanger the public and that you understand all the laws governing it. But that's not the case in terms of possessing--\n\nRep. Richard Hudson: But driving is a privilege, owning a firearm is a Constitutionally protected right. So there is a difference.\n\nThe central tenet of Concealed Carry Reciprocity is that the Second Amendment gives people the right to carry guns anywhere they want but that idea is more aspiration than factual.\n\nSteve Kroft: Is there such a thing?\n\nRobyn Thomas: Absolutely not. In fact, the Supreme Court has ruled on the Second Amendment in 2008. And what the Supreme Court said is that you have a right to have a handgun in your home for self-defense. And it absolutely does not include a right to carry a loaded, concealed weapon in public. And right up until the Supreme Court says it is your right, that is a fallacy that they're pushing, in the hopes that it will become the truth. But it simply isn't the truth as of right now.\n\nBut Tim Schmidt of the U.S. Concealed Carry Association thinks it should be.\n\nSteve Kroft: The Bill of Rights doesn't say that anybody could walk around with a gun in their pocket or a gun in their hostler-- a concealed weapon. It doesn't say that.\n\nTim Schmidt: Steve, with all due respect, it actually does. It says you have the right to keep and bear arms and it shall not be infringed. Telling me where I can and can't carry a gun, telling me where I can and can't protect my family and loved ones, that's an infringement. Yes, that's gone on for a long time in our country, but we're finally fixing it.\n\nAs in almost all political arguments today, each side comes equipped with alternative facts and opposition research, allowing people to believe whatever they want. The NRA claims the only way to stop bad guys with guns is to have more good guys with guns -- it will make people safer\u2026and its facts, as recited by representative Hudson of North Carolina, claim it's working.\n\nRep. Richard Hudson: I can tell you that, you know, \u00a0in the last 20 years, you've seen-- a huge uptick in gun ownership. You've seen a huge uptick in conceal carry permit holders, and at the same time, you see violent crime drop. If you look at the states that have Constitutional carry, you've seen violent crime drop.\n\nSteve Kroft: Are you saying that the more guns that are out there, the safer the population is?\n\nRep. Richard Hudson: I dunno if I'd go quite that far. But, you know, I'm-- I'm not gonna come out here and say the-- the solution to gun violence is give everyone a gun. But I'm also saying that's not gonna necessarily increase violence.\n\nThat conclusion has been refuted by numerous studies, as well as testimony from chiefs of police like Edward Flynn in Milwaukee, who says Wisconsin's six-year experiment with lax concealed carry laws has been a disaster.\n\nChief Edward Flynn in 2017: Every year since that law was passed in 2011, every year, non-fatal shootings have gone up, gun-related homicides have gone up, and the number of guns seized from the streets by our department has gone up.That's what our cockamamie law has done here.\n\nSteve Kroft: Why is this bill so important to the NRA?\n\nCyrus Vance: The goal is, of the gun lobby, to have what they call Constitutional Carry, which means that you-- anyone can have a gun, anywhere, anytime. Because the Constitution, and the Second Amendment, in their view, says that. And so the world that they imagine is one where everyone can have a gun. That's not the world that I think I wanna live in. But that's the world that I think they're tryin' to create.\n\nWhether people like it or not, that world already exists in many parts of the country where people are quite happy with it and so are their representatives in Congress.

Sessions left the Senate to become President Trump's attorney general.\n\nBut a strange series of events led to a Democrat being a elected in one of the deepest red states in the country. Former Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley appointed state\u00a0Attorney General Luther Strange\u00a0to the seat, although Strange had been investigating Bentley and his office, and set Dec. 12 as the date for the special election. Facing impeachment and a sex scandal, Bentley resigned in April. Both Strange and Bentley have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nMoore, who as a judge had\u00a0twice been removed from the bench, won the Republican primary in Sept., partially by tying Strange to corruption in Washington and Montgomery specifically. Although Moore was considered the favorite to win the Dec. election, accusations surfaced in Nov. of\u00a0sexual misconduct by several women, including allegedly initiating sexual encounters with teens as young as 14. Moore denied the allegations, but many Republicans called for him to step aside and the Republican National Committee pulled its financial support. Eventually, the RNC resumed its support and\u00a0Mr. Trump even recorded a robocall.\n\nEven before the sexual misconduct allegations, the race had attracted national attention -- and outside money, especially from national Democrats. Although Democrats suffered a number of losses in special elections in 2017, the national party was energized after\u00a0winning the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial\u00a0elections. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and civil rights icon U.S. Rep. John Lewis campaigned for Jones, and former President Obama even recorded a robocall.\n\nFrom Oct. 1 through Nov. 22,\u00a0Jones raised \u00a0$10,101,243, compared to\u00a0Moore's $1,767,365, according to federal election filings that\u00a0came out before the election.\u00a0Jones outspent Moore 10 to 1\u00a0and campaign says supporters knocked on 300,000 doors and made more than one million calls.", "link": null, "source": "CBS News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "", "body": "MIAMI -- Officials were so concerned about the mental stability of the student accused of last month's Florida school massacre that they decided he should be forcibly committed. But the recommendation was never acted upon. A commitment under the law would have made it more difficult if not impossible for Nikolas Cruz to obtain a gun legally.\n\nCruz is accused of the shooting rampage that killed 14 students and three school employees at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland on Feb. 14. In addition, 17 people were wounded.\n\nBut more than a year earlier, documents in the criminal case against Nikolas Cruz and obtained by The Associated Press show school officials and a sheriff's deputy recommended in September 2016 that Cruz be involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation.\n\nThe documents, which are part of Cruz's criminal case in the shooting, show that he had written the word \"kill\" in a notebook, told a classmate that he wanted to buy a gun and use it, and had cut his arm supposedly in anger because he had broken up with a girlfriend. He also told another student he had drunk gasoline and was throwing up. Calls had even been made to the FBI about the possibility of Cruz using a gun at school.\n\nThe documents were provided by a psychological assessment service initiated by Cruz's mother called Henderson Behavioral Health. The documents show a high school resource officer who was also a sheriff's deputy and two school counselors recommended in September 2016 that Cruz be committed for mental evaluation under Florida's Baker Act. That law allows for involuntary commitment for mental health examination for at least three days.\n\nSuch an involuntary commitment would also have been a high obstacle if not a complete barrier to legally obtaining a firearm, such as the AR-15 rifle used in the Stoneman Douglas massacre on Feb. 14, authorities say.\n\nIn the month since the shooting, survivors from the school have called for reforms in gun laws. On March 14, they encouraged students nationwide to take part in the March for Our Lives, a walkout from school\u00a0 to protest gun violence.\n\nThere is no evidence Cruz was ever committed. Coincidentally, the school resource officer who recommended that Cruz be \"Baker Acted\" was Scot Peterson -- the same Broward Sheriff's Office deputy who resigned amid accusations he failed to respond to the shooting by staying outside the building where the killings occurred.\n\nDavid S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor, said that an involuntary commitment would have been a huge red flag had Cruz attempted to buy a firearm legally.\n\n\"If he had lied, hopefully the verification of the form would have pulled up the commitment paperwork,\" Weinstein said.\n\nThe documents do not say why Cruz was not committed under the Baker Act or whether he may not have qualified for other reasons. The law allows a law enforcement officer such as Peterson to initiate commitment under the Baker Act.\n\nAn attorney for Peterson did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Sunday.\n\nCruz, 19, is charged in a 34-count indictment with killing 17 people and wounding 17 others in the attack. He faces the death penalty if convicted, but his public defender Melisa McNeill has said he would plead guilty in return for a life prison sentence.\n\nIn the Henderson Behavioral Health documents, Cruz's mother Lynda is quoted as saying she had fresh concerns about her son's mental state after he punched holes in a wall at their home in Parkland. The clinicians at Henderson came to the home for interviews and said Cruz admitted punching the wall but said he did so because he was upset at a breakup with his girlfriend.\n\nCruz also admitted cutting his arm with a pencil sharpener.\n\nAfter a Sept. 28, 2016 interview, the documents say Cruz \"reports that he cut his arms 3-4 weeks ago and states that this is the only time he has ever cut. (Cruz) states that he cut because he was lonely, states that he had broken up with his girlfriend and reports that his grades had fallen. (Cruz) states that he is better now, reports that he is no longer lonely and states that his grades have gone back up.\"\n\nHe also told the clinician he owned only a pellet gun and was not capable of doing \"serious harm\" to anyone.\n\nThe documents show that Cruz was very much on the radar screen of mental health professionals and the Broward County school system, yet very little appears to have been done other than these evaluations.\n\nOther red flags have also surfaced, including calls to the FBI about Cruz's potential to become a school shooter and numerous visits by county law enforcement officials to his home -- both before his mother died in November and after, when he lived briefly with a family friend in Palm Beach County.\n\nAgain, very little was done.\n\nIt's not clear from the documents who the recommendation was forwarded to or why it was not followed up.", "link": null, "source": "CBS News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Alan He", "body": "The tech giant Facebook is facing a growing backlash on Capitol Hill as more lawmakers demand that CEO Mark Zuckerberg testify about reports that Cambridge Analytica, a political data consulting firm utilized by the Trump campaign, harvested the information of up to 50 million users.\n\n\"Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify under oath in public before the Judiciary Committee.

So did U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, in what ultimately became one of his last public statements before being fired.\n\nBut at the White House, President Donald Trump's initial response was more circumspect. In his first remarks on the incident, Mr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday morning: \"It sounds to me that it would be Russia based on all the evidence they have.\"\n\nHe added a qualification, however: \"As soon as we get the facts straight, if we agree with them, we will condemn Russia or whoever it may be.\"\n\nMr. Trump's spokeswoman pointedly avoided naming Russia as the likely perpetrator of the attack. Tougher rhetoric came only on Wednesday evening, when White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders put out a statement saying the U.S. \"stands in solidarity with its closest ally\" and shares Britain's assessment that \"Russia is responsible for the reckless nerve agent attack.\"\n\nFor U.S. allies and some congressional lawmakers, it was another befuddling example of the president appearing to soft-pedal in the face of Moscow's provocations. Some Russia watchers said the fact that the U.S. had to play catch-up to align itself with the British was glaring, particularly at a time of uncertainty over the trajectory of American foreign policy.\n\n\"It's striking the contrast between what the Brits have done and what the U.S. has not done,\" said Angela Stent, director of Georgetown University's Center for Eurasian, Russian, and East European Studies. Stent said that while it's unlikely the U.S. would levy new sanctions on Russia over an incident on British soil, \"you would still expect solidarity\" from Washington.\n\nThe pressure on Mr. Trump to forcefully respond to the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian agent convicted of spying for Britain, and his daughter Yulia escalated Wednesday when May announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats and severed high-level contacts with Moscow. May also vowed both open and covert action against Russia, which denies being behind the nerve agent attack.\n\nThe White House initially said Trump agreed with May on \"the need for consequences\" following the attack, but did not specify whether the U.S. planned any punishment of its own. Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Wednesday that Russia must cooperate with the British investigation and \"account for its actions.\"\n\nSanders' statement Wednesday evening went further: \"The latest action by Russia fits into a pattern of behavior in which Russia disregards the international rules-based order, undermines the sovereignty and security of countries worldwide, and attempts to subvert and discredit Western democratic institutions and processes. The United States is working together with our allies and partners to ensure that this kind of abhorrent attack does not happen again.\"\n\nSome congressional lawmakers had nudged Trump to bolster the U.S. response, including Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who said, \"Americans ought to be leading a conversation with our NATO allies about a collective response to this act and future acts of aggression.\"\n\nMay's rapid response stands in stark contrast to Mr. Trump's handling of Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election, which is now a centerpiece of special counsel Robert Mueller's sprawling investigation. Trump has often muddied the conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies, declaring that while Russia interfered, others likely did as well. And he's irritated Russia hawks in Congress, including numerous Republicans, by declining to use a new law letting the U.S. slap sanctions on foreign companies or governments that do business with Russia's defense or intelligence sectors. Those powers took effect in January, but so far nobody has been punished.\n\nThis latest Russian provocation against a close U.S. partner comes at a particularly delicate moment for the Trump administration, with both allies and adversaries closely watching U.S. foreign policy after Tillerson's ouster. Though Tillerson faced initial skepticism about his posture toward Russia given his business relationships with the Kremlin, the former head of ExxonMobil emerged as a leading Russia critic in the Trump Cabinet. He repeatedly took Moscow to task for its actions in Ukraine, Syria and elsewhere.\n\n\"Rex Tillerson was the person that Donald Trump was relying on for Russia policy,\" said Andrew Weiss, who held national security positions during the Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush administrations and now serves as vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"That's all now up for grabs.\"\n\nMr. Trump has tapped CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace Tillerson at the State Department. The former Republican congressman has accepted the intelligence agencies' conclusion that Russia interfered in the election, but has downplayed the notion that the meddling was an effort to help Mr. Trump get elected.\n\n\"The Russians attempted to interfere in the United States election in 2016. They also did so before that,\" Pompeo told Fox News Sunday. \"There's a long history of Russian efforts to influence the United States and conduct influence operations against the United States.\"\n\nPompeo also raised eyebrows earlier this year by meeting senior Russian security officials in Washington days before the Trump administration declined to impose new sanctions on Moscow over the election interference. Pompeo described the meetings as normal contacts for the heads of espionage services.\n\nIf Pompeo is confirmed by the Senate, the U.S. relationship with Russia will be among the most vexing issues he has to tackle. Tillerson lamented the state of affairs with Moscow on one of his final days as America's top diplomat, unaware he was about to hand off the problem to a new secretary of state.\n\n\"I've become extremely concerned about Russia,\" he said. \"We spent most of last year investing a lot into attempts to work together, to solve problems, to address differences.

The family argued Angilau only had a pen and the four shots fired were excessive.\n\n\"Having carefully reviewed the video of Mr. Angilau's swift flight from counsel table, his vault over the witness stand with pen in hand, and his attempt to violently attack the shackled witness, the court has little difficulty determining that (Jane) Doe's use of force to immediately stop Angilau's attack was objectively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances,\" Dowdell wrote.\n\nThe Angilau family attorney, Bob Skyes, offers a contradictory point of view. He said the video shows that the marshal \"panicked\" and should have used other methods to subdue Angilau. He points out that Angilau was already down on the ground for the final three shots and that a courtroom full of officers could have stopped him before he harmed anyone with the pen.\n\n\"There was no need to use deadly force,\" Sykes said. \"They weren't entitled to use the death penalty on him for an assault.\"\n\nSykes said the Angilau family hasn't decided if they'll appeal the ruling throwing out the wrongful death lawsuit.\n\nAngilau was one of 17 people named in a 2010 indictment accusing Tongan Crip members of assault, conspiracy, robbery and weapons offenses.

He has mocked its judges for blocking his agenda, sued over its lax enforcement of immigration laws and threatened to pull out federal agents.\n\nBut there's something he's dying to see here: the prototypes for his long-promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. And there's something he's eager to do here: raise cash from the Beverly Hills crowd.\n\nMr. Trump's arrival Tuesday will come just days after his Justice Department sued to block a trio of state laws designed to protect people living in the U.S. illegally. Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown likened it to \"an act of war\" with Trump's administration.\n\n\"The State of California is sheltering dangerous criminals in a brazen and lawless attack on our Constitutional system of government,\" Trump complained in his weekly address, accusing California's leaders of being \"in open defiance of federal law.\"\n\n\"They don't care about crime.

They don't care about robberies,\" he said, calling on Congress to block the state's federal funds.\n\nLast week, Oakland's mayor warned residents of an impending immigration raid \u2014 a move that Mr. Trump called disgraceful and said put law enforcement officers at risk.\n\nThe state has also joined lawsuits aimed at stopping construction of Mr. Trump's stalled border wall.

The 20-18 vote came after three hours of often emotional debate. Support and opposition crossed party lines, and it was clear many of those who voted for the bill weren't entirely happy with it.\n\n\"Do I think this bill goes far enough? No! No, I don't!\" said Democratic Sen. Lauren Book, who tearfully described visiting Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after 17 people were fatally shot on Valentine's Day.\n\nShe also would have liked a ban on assault-style rifles, like many of the students who traveled to the state capital to ask lawmakers to go even further to stop future mass shootings. But Book said she couldn't let the legislative session end Friday without doing something.\n\n\"My community was rocked. My school children were murdered in their classrooms. I cannot live with a choice to put party politics above an opportunity to get something done that inches us closer to the place I believe we should be as a state,\" she said. \"This is the first step in saying never again.\"\n\nEarlier Monday, families of the 17 Florida high school massacre victims called on the state's Legislature to pass a bill they believe will improve school security.\n\nReading a statement outside Stoneman Douglas High School in Broward County, Ryan Petty implored legislators to pass Gov. Rick Scott's proposal to add armed security guards, keep guns away from the mentally ill and improve mental health programs for at-risk teens. Scott also opposes arming teachers.\n\n\"We must be the last families to lose loved ones in a mass shooting at a school. This time must be different and we demand action,\" said Petty, reading from the group statement.\n\nPetty's 14-year-old daughter, Alaina, was killed in the Feb. 14 shooting, along with 13 schoolmates and three staff members.\n\nIf just one more senator voted no instead of yes Monday evening, the bill would have failed. Republicans and Democrats alike said there were parts of the bill they didn't like. Democrats didn't like the idea of letting teachers carry guns, even if the bill was amended to water down that proposed program. And many pro-gun rights Republicans didn't like the idea of raising the minimum age to buy rifles from 18 to 21 and to create a waiting period on sales of the weapons.\n\nThe Senate amended its bill to limit which teachers could volunteer to go through law enforcement training and carry guns in schools. Any teacher who does nothing but work in a classroom would not be eligible for the program, but teachers who perform other duties, such as serving as a coach, and other school employees could still participate. Other exceptions would be made for teachers who are current or former law enforcement officers, members of the military or who teach in a Junior Reserve Officer's Training Corps program.\n\nThe bill would name the program for slain assistant football coach Aaron Feis, who has been hailed as a hero for shielding students during the school attack. The 37-year-old graduated from Stoneman Douglas in 1999 and worked mainly with the junior varsity, living in nearby Coral Springs with his wife and daughter. Republican Sen. Bill Galvano said he asked for and received the approval of Feis' family to name the program for him.\n\nGalvano, who took the lead on the bill, said he recognized that there was bipartisan opposition to it but said that was a good thing.\n\n\"You know what that means in my experience? That we've gotten somewhere,\" he said. \"We're hitting nerves. We're going into areas that may not be our comfort zone.\"\n\nAnd he said the bill will make a difference. In addition to the gun restrictions and arming some school personnel, it would create new mental health programs for schools, improve communication between schools, law enforcement and state agencies, create a task force to look at mistakes made during mass shootings nationally and then make recommendations on how to continue to improve law, and establish an anonymous tip line where students and others can report threats to schools.\n\n\"This bill will make a difference now. When it becomes law, things will start changing,\" Galvano said. \"We listened and we're trying. We're trying hard, we don't have all the answers but we are giving it our best and we will keep giving it our best.\"\n\nThe bill now goes to the House, which has a similar bill still waiting for consideration by the full chamber.

More than 1,000 absentee ballots were still being tabulated as the count carried into Wednesday.\n\nVoters in Western Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district head to the polls Tuesday for a hotly contested special House election. Republicans have spent nearly $10 million to save a seat that won't exist in its current form by November.\n\nIn a race this close, either candidate's supporters can ask for a recount. However there are stiff requirements, including requiring three voters in the same precinct who can attest that error or fraud was committed.\n\nThe stakes in the high-profile special election were more political than practical.\n\nThe ultimate winner will face re-election in just eight months, and the congressional district as currently shaped will likely vanish next year thanks to a court-ordered redrawing of the state's district maps. Yet President Trump and his chief allies invested tremendous time and resources in keeping the seat in Republican hands, mindful the contest could be used to measure Trump's lasting appeal among white, working-class voters and Democrats' anti-Trump fervor.\n\nThe White House scrambled to rally voters behind Saccone, who cast himself as the president's \"wingman,\" but he struggled at times to connect with the blue-collar coalition that fueled Trump's victory little more than a year ago.\n\nLamb, a 33-year old former federal prosecutor, asserted his independence from the Democratic Party, courted labor backing and focused on local issues. He studiously downplayed his opposition to the Republican president in the district where Trump's support has slipped by not plummeted.\n\n\"This didn't have much to do with President Trump,\" Lamb said Tuesday after casting his vote in suburban Pittsburgh.\n\nThe president has campaigned in the district twice and sent several tweets on Saccone's behalf. Other recent visitors include the vice president, the president's eldest son, the president's daughter and the president's chief counselor. Outside groups aligned with Republicans poured more than $10 million of dollars into the contest.\n\nFor Democrats, a win would reverberate nationwide, while even a narrow loss would be viewed as a sign of increased Democratic enthusiasm just as the midterm season begins.\n\nLamb's excited supporters included his middle school football and basketball coach, Joe DelSardo, who recalled him as \"a leader from the beginning.\"\n\nThe former coach described the district as having \"a lot of suit-and-tie people and people who dig in the dirt.\" Lamb, he said, \"can talk to all of them, and that's why he can win.\"\n\nRegistered Republican Brett Gelb said he voted for Saccone, largely because the Republican candidate promised to support the president.\n\n\"Saccone backs a lot of President Trump's plans for the country,\" said Gelb, a 48-year-old fire technician who lives in Mt. Lebanon. He added, \"I do think Trump is doing a good job.

The seat has been in Republican hands for the past 15 years.\n\nIt was open now only because longtime Republican congressman Tim Murphy, who espoused strong anti-abortion views, resigned last fall amid revelations of an extramarital affair in which he urged his mistress to get an abortion.\n\nWith polls showing a tight race for months, Saccone tried to persuade the GOP-leaning electorate that their choice was about \"making America great again,\" as the president repeatedly says.\n\nSaccone, a 60-year-old Air Force veteran turned state lawmaker and college instructor, enjoyed enthusiastic backing from the social conservatives who've anchored his state career. He's been perhaps at his most animated when emphasizing his opposition to abortion rights.\n\nYet Saccone struggled to raise money and stir the same passions that helped Trump on his way to the White House. The consistent fundraising deficit left him with limited resources to air the message he delivered one-on-one: His four decades of experience in the private sector, international business and now the Legislature should make voters' choice a no-brainer.\n\nLamb, meanwhile, excited core Democrats and aimed for independents and moderate Republicans.\n\n\"We worked really hard for it,\" Lamb said after voting.\n\nNational Republican groups filled airwaves and social media with depictions of the first-time candidate as little more than a lemming for Nancy Pelosi \u2014 the Democratic House leader that Republicans love to hate.\n\nLamb answered the criticism by saying he wouldn't support Pelosi as floor leader, much less as speaker if the Democrats should retake control of the House. He also said he opposes major new gun restrictions \u2014 though he backs expanded background checks \u2014 and declared himself personally opposed to abortion, despite his support for its legality.\n\nBesides bruising the president, a Lamb defeat also could shake Republican self-assurance that their new tax law can shield them from other political woes.\n\nLamb embraced Democratic orthodoxy on the new GOP tax law, hammering it as a giveaway to corporations at the future expense of Social Security, Medicare and the nation's fiscal security.

He added that his administration was working hard to respond to the Florida rampage.\n\nThe students planned to hold a rally Wednesday to put more pressure on the Legislature.\n\n\"I really think they are going to hear us out,\" said Chris Grady, a high school senior aboard the bus.\n\nThe Feb. 14 attack initially appeared to overcome the resistance of some in the state's political leadership, which has rebuffed gun restrictions since Republicans took control of both the governor's office and the Legislature in 1999. However, many members of the party still have strong resistance to any gun-control measures.\n\nThe Parkland students also plan to meet Wednesday with top legislative leaders, including House Speaker Richard Corcoran and Senate President Joe Negron.\n\nFlorida has a reputation for expanding gun rights. Negron sponsored a 2011 bill that Republican Gov. Rick Scott signed into law that banned cities and counties from regulating gun and ammunition sales.\n\nScott organized three committees to look at school safety, mental health and gun safety issues that met Tuesday and vowed to make changes to better protect students. While Scott told reporters several times that \"everything is on the table,\" he did not answer whether his proposal would include any bans on any type of weapons.\n\nInstead, Scott said he is interested in making it harder for people who are temporarily committed to obtain a gun. He also pledged to increase spending on school safety programs and on mental health treatment.\n\nAuthorities said Cruz, 19, had a string of run-ins with school authorities that ended with his expulsion. Police were repeatedly called to his house throughout his childhood. His lawyers said there were many warning signs that he was mentally unstable and potentially violent. Yet he legally purchased a semi-automatic rifle.\n\nNewly released documents reveal that in September 2016, an investigator with\u00a0Florida's Department of Children and Families\u00a0(DCF) visited the family to investigate allegations of medical neglect. The investigator noted Cruz had depression, ADHD and autism. He cut his arms in a Snapchat post and had \"plans to go out and buy a gun,\" the investigator noted at the time.\n\nDCF closed the investigation six weeks later, saying the agency found no evidence of mistreatment.\n\nStoneman Douglas senior Diego Pfeiffer was realistic about what change would happen before the Legislature goes home March 9, but said anything is a good first step.\n\n\"The best case scenario is we move a step forward and that's all we're asking here. We're asking to help save student lives,\" he said. \"Whether it's funding or mental health or gun safety or any of that sort of stuff - I am pro any of that.\"\n\nBut he also said if change doesn't come in the Legislature, he noted he's now 18 and he has the power of his vote.\n\n\"You're our senators and you're our representatives for now. If you don't help us make a change soon, you will be left in the dust,\" he said. \"I'm happily going to vote for anybody who's going to be on our side, the side of children's lives.

Classes will resume next week.\n\nThe Florida community has grappled with recent news that Deputy Scot Peterson did nothing to stop suspect Nikolas Cruz on campus, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said Thursday.\n\nThat failure, plus reports of a delay in security camera footage scanned by responding police and several records indicating the 19-year-old suspect displayed behavioral troubles for years, added to what the Florida House speaker described as an \"abject breakdown at all levels.\"\n\nCBS News correspondent Manuel Bojorquez reports Peterson was allegedly made aware of Cruz's behavior multiple times before the Valentine's Day shooting.\n\nAccording to Broward County Sheriff's Office records, they received more than 20 calls involving Cruz or his brother. Peterson was allegedly made aware of two of those calls, including one about shooting up a school and another in which a peer counselor told Peterson that Cruz ingested gasoline in an attempt to commit suicide.\n\nPeterson took up a position viewing the western entrance of Building 12 for more than four minutes after the shooting started, but \"he never went in,\" Israel said.\n\nThe shooting lasted about six minutes.\n\nPeterson was subsequently suspended without pay and placed under investigation. He later chose to resign from the department.\n\nAsked what Peterson should have done differently, Israel said the deputy should have \"went in, addressed the killer, killed the killer.\"\n\nCruz has been jailed on 17 counts of murder and has admitted to carrying out the attack. He owned a collection of weapons. Defense attorneys, state records and people who knew him have described troubling incidents going back years.\n\nBroward County incident reports show that unidentified callers contacted authorities with concerns about Cruz in February 2016 and November 2017. The first caller said they had third-hand information that Cruz planned to shoot up the school. The information was forwarded to Peterson. The second caller said Cruz was collecting guns and knives and believed \"he could be a school shooter in the making.\"\n\nAlso in November 2017, Cruz was involved in a fight with the adult son of a woman he was staying with shortly after his mother died, according to a Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office report. On Nov. 28, a 22-year-old man at the Lake Worth home told the responding deputy the he tried to calm down Cruz, who had been punching holes in walls and breaking objects, but Cruz hit him in the jaw, and the man hit Cruz back.\n\nThe deputy found Cruz a short time later at a nearby park. Cruz told the deputy he had been angry because he misplaced a photo of his recently deceased mother, and he apologized for losing his temper.\n\nThe other man told the deputy he didn't want Cruz arrested. He just wanted Cruz to calm down before coming home.\n\nCBS News has also learned there was a 20 minute delay in the school's surveillance video. Police say that caused confusion for officers during the shooting trying to find the gunman, but police say no more lives were put in danger because of it.\n\nThat failure is one of many admitted missteps by local and federal law enforcement.\n\nThe FBI is dealing with its handling of complaints made against Cruz. A federal law enforcement source describes the failure on the FBI's end as a \"body blow\" for the entire bureau.\n\nThe shooting has reignited national debate over gun laws and school safety, including proposals by President Trump and others to designate more people -- including teachers -- to carry arms on school grounds. Gun-control advocates, meanwhile, have redoubled calls for bans or further restrictions on assault rifles.\n\nPoliticians under pressure to tighten gun laws in response to the mass shooting floated various plans Thursday, but most fell short of reforms demanded by student activists who converged Wednesday on Florida's Capitol.\n\nFlorida House Speaker Richard Corcoran said Thursday night that his chamber is going to recommend creating a special commission to investigate the \"abject breakdown at all levels\" that led to the shooting deaths. The Republican said the commission, likely be led by a parent of one of the slain children, would have subpoena power.\n\nCorcoran said the news about the resource officer's failure to respond did not dissuade him from moving ahead with what he was calling the \"marshal\" plan to let local law-enforcement officials train and deputize someone at the school who would be authorized to carry a gun.\n\nState Sen. Bill Galvano, who is helping craft a bill in response to the shooting deaths, insisted the idea is not the same as arming teachers. He said the program would be optional and the deputized person would have to be trained by local law-enforcement agencies.\n\nU.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said a visit to Stoneman Douglas prompted him to change his stance on large capacity magazines.

Jay Inslee signed the ban on bump stocks, calling it a \"commonsense piece of legislation.\"\n\n\"It will help save lives from mass gun violence,\" he said, surrounded by lawmakers and gun control advocates.\n\nWashington is one of more than 20 states to introduce legislation seeking to ban the devices after the Oct. 1 shooting in Nevada -- the deadliest in modern U.S. history.\n\n\"There's nothing we can do to bring back those lost from gun violence. But as we've seen in Parkland, Las Vegas, Orlando, Sandy Hook and too many other locations whose names have become synonymous with tragedy, we cannot sit by and merely offer thoughts and prayers,\" Inslee said on Twitter.\n\nBans were previously passed by Massachusetts, New Jersey and the cities of Denver and Columbia, South Carolina, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Federal officials also are considering regulating or banning the devices.\n\nCalifornia banned \"multiburst trigger activators\" in 1990, and last October the California Department of Justice issued an advisory to gun retailers saying bump stocks were illegal under that law. A bill has since been introduced in the Legislature there to specify the law would include bump stocks.\n\nUsing bump stocks, Stephen Paddock killed 58 people and injured hundreds more at a country music festival while firing from a window of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino before killing himself.\n\nSurvivors and relatives of those killed testified in January about the Washington state bill. The new law makes it illegal for anyone in Washington to manufacture or sell bump stocks beginning July 1.\n\nIn July 2019, it will become illegal to own or possess a bump stock in the state. A provision of the bill also allows the Washington State Patrol to set up a yearlong \"buy back\" program for people who already own the devices.\n\nRepublican state Sen. Mike Padden, who voted against the measure, said he didn't think the state should have taken action while the federal government is evaluating bump stocks. \"We all want to avoid killings in our state, I just don't know if banning that piece of plastic is going to do it,\" Padden said.\n\nSeveral other gun measures introduced in the Washington Legislature this year have stalled, including banning most magazines that hold more than 10 rounds and mandating safe storage of firearms.\n\nHowever, a bill that would enhance background checks on rifle purchases and raise the legal age to buy rifles to 21 was introduced and passed out of a Senate committee after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people.\n\nThe bill also creates a program for students and others to report concerns about dangerous activities via a mobile app and establishes emergency response systems for schools during a threat.\n\nIt's unclear whether the bill has enough support to come up for a vote on the Senate floor.\n\nBefore the bill signing by Inslee, dozens of students rallied in the Olympia Capitol, chanting \"No more silence, end gun violence\" and carrying signs reading: \"Vote like Parkland is your land, Newtown is your town, and like Columbine is around the corner.\"\n\nInslee listed several sites of recent mass shootings, including Parkland, that are \"synonymous with tragedy.\"\n\n\"We cannot sit idly by and take no action,\" he said. \"We as leaders and lawmakers have to be judged by our actions and we need actions right now on this scourge.\"", "link": null, "source": "CBS News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "", "body": "The Justice Department said Tuesday it is suing the state of California, Gov.

She said the state agency is assisting.\n\nHickman, who is shown on video subduing and punching 33-year-old Johnnie Jermaine Rush, had a history of treating people rudely, according to a city memo that also seeks to address concerns about why the case unfolded slowly outside of public view.\n\nThe August excessive-force case, revealed last week when a newspaper published body-cam video, has roiled leaders in Asheville, a mountain tourist destination with a liberal-leaning, mostly white population. Late Monday, the Asheville City Council voted to release a memo detailing how the case was handled.\n\nThe case became public after The Citizen-Times newspaper published footage last week.\n\nRush, whom officers had accused of jaywalking, was also shocked with a stun gun as he screamed in pain. The altercation unfolded around midnight Aug. 25 near the city's minor-league baseball stadium and a cluster of breweries that help fuel a booming tourism industry.\n\nCity Manager Gary Jackson wrote in the memo Monday that Hickman's use of \"excessive and dangerous force\" is \"a source of great anger and concern within the community.\" Asheville's population of nearly 90,000 is 82 percent white and 12 percent black. Hickman resigned in January.\n\nPastor Ronald Gates, who joined other black clergy members in voicing concerns to city leaders last week, said he was appalled not only by \"the inhumane act\" he saw on the video, but also the length of time it took for details to surface publicly.\n\nHowever, the leader of Greater Works Church said Tuesday that the memo's release is a step toward restoring trust: \"There's a strong stance toward making things right.\"\n\nAccording to the memo, an extensive review of body camera footage from all of Hickman's encounters with the public - some 58 hours - revealed four other times in which he \"displayed discourteous and rude conduct to members of the public.\" It's not clear if those four incidents were previously known to Hickman's superiors; Jackson wrote that they didn't result in complaints. The memo doesn't elaborate on what happened in those cases.\n\nThe Asheville newspaper's story sparked recriminations over the handling of the case and the video leak. Under North Carolina law, a judge generally must sign off on any public release of police body camera video.\n\nDistrict Attorney Todd Williams issued a statement last week that the video leak could compromise prosecutions and \"may require its own independent investigation.\" Asheville police Chief Tammy Hooper, who issued an apology to Rush, has also called for an investigation of the leak.\n\nYet on Monday, Asheville City Attorney Robin Currin requested that a judge allow public release of all video surrounding Rush's arrest, noting \"it is critical that the public be provided with a complete picture.\"\n\nThe memo released Monday by the City Council gives the most complete account yet of the case.\n\nHours after he was arrested, Rush filed an excessive force complaint. The memo says the police chief reviewed footage that day, ordered that Hickman turn in his badge and gun and placed him on administrative duty. A supervisor who responded to the scene was also disciplined over the handling of information in the case.\n\nCharges against Rush, including impeding traffic and resisting arrest, were dropped in September. No working phone listing could be found for Rush, who's heard on video saying he was leaving work when officers accused him of failing to use a crosswalk.\n\nAfter the administrative investigation finished in December, the department concluded Hickman used excessive force.

Near-final results released Monday showed that the other seven candidates were far behind Putin in Sunday's voting.\n\nObservers reported widespread ballot stuffing -- video emerged appearing to show people literally cramming ballots into boxes at polling stations, and there was unprecedented pressure on Russians to get out and vote.\n\nBut as CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reports, none of that is likely to have seriously altered the outcome of the vote. Nor are the reports of widespread fraud likely to seriously damage Putin's image, given his popularity and his tight control over Russian politics, and media. The outcome was never in doubt.\n\nWith 99.8 percent of the vote counted, the Central Election Commission said Monday that communist Pavel Grudinin came in a distant second with 11.8 percent. Third was ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky with 5.6 percent. The only candidate to openly criticize Putin during the campaign, liberal TV star Ksenia Sobchak, won just 1.6 percent.\n\nPutin's most serious rival, opposition leader Alexei Navalny, was barred from the race.\n\nThe electoral commission said official turnout was 67 percent, but the figure was thrown into question by images circulating online of ballot stuffing and nationwide accounts of workers being coerced to vote.\n\nRegardless, Putin now has a stronger hold on Russia -- and stronger place in the world -- thanks to the overwhelming mandate for yet another term as president.\n\nHis domestic opponents are largely resigned to another six years in the shadows. His foreign opponents are mired in their own problems, from Britain's messy exit from the European Union to chaos and contradiction in the Trump administration.\n\nThe accusations that he meddled in the U.S. election and sponsored a nerve agent attack in Britain have only bolstered his standing at home.\n\nPalmer reports that after his big win, President Putin directly addressed the accusation from Britain that he was behind the attack on Russian exile and former double agent Sergei Skripal, using a powerful Novichok chemical nerve agent.\n\nHe called the allegation rubbish. But his campaign spokesman actually thanked Britain for helping Putin win so many votes.\n\nIn London, U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on Monday called Russia's ongoing denials of culpability in the attack \"increasingly absurd,\" while in Moscow, a Kremlin spokesman said Britain would have to hand over its evidence \"sooner or later,\" or apologize for the accusation.\n\nWhenever Russia is accused of something, Palmer says, Russians unite around the center of their nation's power. For decades, that power has been embodied by Vladimir Putin, and for at least another term, it will continue to be.\n\nBelow is a look at what to expect from Putin's next six years in power, for Russia's rivals, neighbors and its own 147 million citizens.\n\nRelations between Russia and the West are already at their lowest level since the collapse of the Soviet Union 26 years ago.\n\nDespite a friendly-ish relationship with President Donald Trump, Putin's new mandate gives him little incentive to seek entente with Washington, especially as the investigation of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election intensifies.\n\nPutin-friendly leaders have made gains in recent Italian and German elections. Western countries are likely to see more Russia-linked hacking and propaganda aimed at disrupting elections or otherwise discrediting democracy -- including the U.S. midterm elections in November.\n\nSince Putin's domestic popularity bumps whenever he stands up to the West, expect more tough talk from Putin the next time he faces threats at home, and bolder Russian vetoes at the U.N. Security Council of anything seen as threatening Moscow's interests.\n\nHis claim several weeks ago that Russia has developed new nuclear weapons that can evade missile defenses clearly showed Putin's adamant determination to boost Russia's power to intimidate.\n\nRussian-backed Syrian forces helped rout the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) from Syria, and Putin argues that Russia saved the day in a conflict that had confounded U.S.-led forces fighting against ISIS.\n\nNow those Russian-backed Syrian forces are closing in on the last strongholds of Western-backed rebel forces.\n\nViewing that as a geopolitical and military victory over an illegal Western-led intervention, Russia is unlikely to pull out of Syria anytime soon.\n\nAn emboldened Putin could position the resurgent Russian military as a peacemaker in other regional conflicts -- for example in Libya, where Russia has oil interests and where a disastrous Western invasion seven years ago left a lawless state now seething with extremists.\n\nTo Russians, Putin's biggest victory in 18 years in power was annexing Crimea and crushing Ukraine's ambitions to move closer to the EU and NATO.\n\nPutin is frustrated at the resulting U.S. and EU sanctions but appears unwilling to make concessions that would bring them to an end. Ukraine is split between a volatile government in Kiev and a Russia-backed separatist region stuck in a frozen but still deadly conflict that serves Putin's interests.\n\nMoscow's actions in Ukraine sent a warning signal to other countries in Russia's orbit that reaching westward is dangerous. And former Soviet bloc states within the EU are increasingly drifting back toward Moscow, from Hungary and Poland to the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\nPutin's new mandate could theoretically hand him the power to make bold reforms that Russia has long needed to raise living standards and wean itself from its oil dependence.\n\nBut Putin has convinced Russian voters that drastic change is dangerous, and that protecting the country from threats takes precedence over improving daily life.\n\nExperts predict he may enact some changes like expanding affordable housing and fighting corruption on a local level.\n\nBut less likely are bigger changes such as overhauling the pension system, which is unpopular among a strong Putin voting base, or spending cuts in the security sector, unpopular among the ex-KGB friends in Putin's entourage.\n\nRussia has weathered a two-year recession, and inflation and the deficit are low. But personal incomes have stagnated, the health care system is crumbling and corruption is rife.\n\nThe biggest question for Russians over the next six years is what happens after that.\n\nPutin is constitutionally required to step down in 2024, but he could change the rules to eliminate term limits, or anoint a malleable successor and continue to run things behind the scenes.\n\nAsked at an impromptu news conference Sunday night if he would seek the presidency again in 2030, when he would be eligible again, the 65-year-old Putin snapped back: \"It's ridiculous. Do you think I will sit here until I turn 100?\"\n\nOpposition leader Alexei Navalny, Putin's most serious foe, will face further pressure from authorities as he works to expose corruption and official lies.\n\nOther Putin rivals such as candidate Ksenia Sobchak and oligarch-turned-dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky will try to gain a foothold through upcoming local elections and the parliament.\n\nAnd members of Putin's inner circle will be jockeying for position for the day when he is no longer in the picture.\n\nPutin may revive efforts to promote artificial intelligence and other innovation as part of a focus on the younger generation, whose loyalty he needs to ensure his legacy outlives him.", "link": null, "source": "CBS News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "", "body": "PATTAYA, Thailand -- A Belarusian woman jailed in Thailand for offering sex lessons without a work permit says she has a story to tell involving the Kremlin, Russian billionaires and even the president of the United States. Anastasia Vashukevich, whose extraordinary claims and racy selfies have propelled her to internet fame in recent weeks, told The Associated Press from a police van Wednesday that she fears for her life, and wants to exchange information on alleged Russian ties to Donald Trump's campaign for her own personal safety. But she refused for now to offer any such evidence, and it's not clear if she has any.\n\nVashukevich's story offers a glimpse into the shady world of Russian oligarchs. Mr. Trump's onetime campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, also had ties to that world through his consulting work for one of those oligarchs. Manafort has been indicted on money-laundering charges related to his overseas consulting work by special counsel Robert Mueller. But Mueller has offered no evidence that Manafort linked his Russian contacts to Mr. Trump's campaign or helped Russia meddle in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nThat has not stopped Vashukevich from claiming she has such evidence as she faces possible deportation.\n\nVashukevich shot to fame in early February when Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, one of President Vladimir Putin's top foes, published an investigation drawing on Vashukevich's social media posts suggesting corrupt links between billionaire Oleg Deripaska and a top Kremlin official, Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Prikhodko. The report featured video from Deripaska's yacht in 2016, when Vashukevich claims she was having an affair with him.\n\nRussians have focused on the ties between Deripaska and Prikhodko. But now Vashukevich says -- so far without proof -- that she can link the Kremlin to Mr. Trump and Manafort, who worked for Deripaska a decade before Mr. Trump hired him.\n\nEven Navalny told the AP on Wednesday he has \"certain doubts\" that Vashukevich has any evidence about alleged direct ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\n\"I think such statements are made because of fears for her own life because they have been detained in Thailand,\" he said, adding he believes her fears are well-founded.\n\nNavalny's report made no claim that Vashukevich knew anything about a Russian campaign to influence the U.S. election, and she has produced no evidence that she does.\n\nAs for her claims of Deripaska's ties to the Kremlin official, Deripaska called them nonsense when Navalny alleged them.\n\nIn an emailed response Feb. 8, Deripaska's spokesman said: \"These scandalous and mendacious assumptions are driven by sensationalism and we totally refute these outrageous false allegations in the strongest possible way.\"\n\nDeripaska sued Vashukevich and her \"sex guru,\" Alexander Kirillov, for breach of privacy. The Russian court imposed an injunction, and communications providers blocked access to Navalny's website for several weeks until he deleted the videos.\n\nA Feb. 15 statement from Deripaska said: \"Mr. Deripaska's claim is to protect his right to privacy and has nothing to do with any political struggle between Mr. Navalny and his political opponents.\"\n\nA request for comment Wednesday from the Russian government went unanswered.\n\nOn Sunday, Vashukevich was arrested along with nine other people, including Kirillov, in the Thai resort of Pattaya while giving sex lessons to Russian tourists. Immigration Police Maj. Satawat Srirattanapong said the 10 were charged with working without a permit, and one with having an expired visa.\n\nVashukevich said she won't give details of what she knows until she is guaranteed she won't be sent to Russia.\n\n\"I can say something only when I will be in a safe place, sorry, because I am worried about my life,\" Vashukevich told the AP from a police van that was taking the detainees from Pattaya to Bangkok's Immigration Detention Center.\n\nVashukevich had earlier posted a video on Instagram, also apparently made while in custody in Pattaya, addressed to \"Dear American media.\"\n\n\"I didn't want to tell you about many things. Now they're trying to lock us up,\" she said. \"But now I'm ready to put together all the pieces of the puzzle that you have been missing, and back it up with audio and video regarding the ties of our esteemed lawmakers with Manafort, Trump and all this buzz around the U.S. election. I know a lot.\"\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly denied that he colluded with Russia to influence the U.S. election.\n\nKirillov, the \"sex guru\" known in Russia for staging high-profile sexual happenings that usually involve sending scantily clad women out in public, told AP from the police van that the Russian government was behind their arrests.\n\n\"Political reasons. We know so much. So that's why they want us to go to Russia,\" he said. \"We think that in a few days, maybe even today, they will send us to Russia, very fast, and I think you will lose us, and never see us more.\"\n\nKirillov and Vashukevich have both recorded their activities on social media, with racy photos and videos taken in many countries. One of the tamer photos on Kirillov's feed shows him posing in front of Trump Tower in New York. Kirillov, who Thai police say is Russian, posts under the pseudonym Alex Lesley. Vashukevich, who is from Belarus, uses the name Nastya Rybka.\n\nThey were arrested in a hotel meeting room in Pattaya, a seaside resort noted for its sex industry and popularity with Russian visitors. The lessons were attended by about 40 Russian tourists, many wearing T-shirts bearing the English words \"Sex animator\" with an arrow pointing to the wearer's crotch. Thai news media cited police as saying that the meeting was raided because hotel staff reported hearing strange sounds.\n\nSatawat, the police major, said all 10 arrested people have had their visas revoked and will be detained at the Immigration Detention Center in Bangkok until the charges of working illegally are resolved. He said police have up to 48 days to process the cases before handing them to prosecutors. If they plead guilty, he said, their cases could end without trial and they could leave the country.\n\nCanceling a visa normally allows a country to expel a person without having to go through the legal process of extradition.\n\nPutin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied Wednesday that the Russians' case had anything to do with a visit to Thailand by Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev. He said Patrushev often makes overseas visits arranged in advance.\n\n\"It's ludicrous to link this to the detention of Russian nationals in Thailand,\" he said.\n\nNavalny said given recent events -- including a cocaine bust at the Russian Embassy in Argentina -- he wasn't so sure.\n\n\"I don't know what to think,\" Navalny told the AP. \"Shows like 'Homeland' begin to look entirely realistic when you look at what is happening in Russia now.

Under the deal, she is due to be released in the summer.\u00a0 She is also being fined the equivalent of about $1,400.\n\nLasky called the legal proceedings a \"farce.\" She said \"they are trying to deter other Palestinian youth from resisting occupation as Ahed did.\"\n\nThe judge agreed to a similar plea deal for Tamimi's mother Nariman, who has been charged with incitement.\n\n\"This is injustice, this court is designed to oppress the Palestinians,\" her father Bassem said. He said they agreed to the deal because they had been threatened with three years in jail. Bassem had visited his daughter and wife for the first time in prison the day before. He said Ahed spends her time doing school work.\n\nAn Israeli supporter of Tamimi slapped a prosecutor after the ruling and was later arrested by police.\n\nTamimi was arrested in December after video surfaced of her kicking the soldiers outside her West Bank home. While some praised the soldiers for showing restraint, hard-line politicians criticized what they felt was a weak response and called for tough action against the girl, whose family has a long history of run-ins with the Israelis.\n\nBut the full-throttle prosecution of Tamimi, who turned 17 behind bars, has drawn widespread international criticism. An Israeli official's revelation that he had once had parliament investigate whether the blond, blue-eyed Tamimis are \"real\" Palestinians drew accusations of racism and helped stoke additional interest in the case.\n\nThe case touches on what constitutes legitimate resistance to Israel's rule over millions of Palestinians, now in its 51st year, in territories it captured in the 1967 war.\n\n\"No justice under occupation and we are in an illegal court,\" Tamimi said to reporters in court.\n\nAhed Tamimi's supporters see a brave girl who struck the soldiers in anger after having just learned that Israeli troops seriously wounded a 15-year-old cousin, shooting him in the head from close range with a rubber bullet during nearby stone-throwing clashes.\n\nIn Israel, she is seen either as a naive youth manipulated by her elders or a threat to Israel's military deterrence. The incident also sparked debate about the soldiers' refusal to act.\n\nIsrael has treated Tamimi's actions as a criminal offense, indicting her on charges of assault and incitement that carry up to 14 years in prison.\n\nSince 2009, residents of Tamimi's village of Nabi Salah have staged regular anti-occupation protests that often end with stone-throwing clashes. Ahed Tamimi has participated in such marches from a young age, and has had several highly publicized run-ins with soldiers.\n\nOne photo shows the then-12- year-old raising a clenched fist toward a soldier towering over her.\n\nFollowing her latest arrest, images of the girl became popular on posters in the West Bank. Some 1.7 million people worldwide have signed a petition calling for her release.\n\nThe case has drawn attention to Israel's military court system, which is used to try Palestinians in the West Bank. Israeli West Bank settlers, on the other hand, are tried under Israeli civilian courts.\n\nThe dueling justice systems have drawn criticism from international rights groups. The military courts have a near 100 percent conviction rate, in part because so many Palestinians agree to plea bargains. Critics say the system gives Palestinians few rights, and they are often coerced into plea deals. Hundreds of Palestinian minors are processed by the military court system each year.\n\n\"Ahed will be home in a few months, but Israel is putting this child behind bars for eight months for calling for protests and slapping a soldier, after threatening her with years in jail,\" said Human Rights Watch Middle East Director Sarah Leah Whitson.", "link": null, "source": "CBS News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "", "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Trump isn't considering firing the special counsel investigating Russian election interference, a top White House lawyer said, after a cascade of Trump tweets revived chatter that the deeply frustrated president may be preparing to can the veteran prosecutor.\n\nIn a first for Mr. Trump, he jabbed directly at special counsel Robert Mueller by name in weekend tweets that both challenged the investigation's existence and suggested political bias on the part of Mueller's investigators. Mr. Trump has long been frustrated by the lengthy and intensifying probe, and insists his 2016 presidential campaign did not collude with Russia to influence the election in his favor.\n\n\"The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime,\" he said in a late Saturday tweet he ended with \"WITCH HUNT!\"\n\nLikely contributing to Mr. Trump's sense of frustration, The New York Times reported last week that Mueller had subpoenaed the Trump Organization for Russia-related documents. Mr. Trump had said Mueller would cross a red line with such a step.\n\n\"Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans?\" he tweeted Sunday.\n\nSome of Mueller's investigators indeed have contributed to Democratic political candidates, but Justice Department policy and federal service law bar discrimination in the hiring of career positions on the basis of political affiliation. Mueller is a Republican.\n\nThe tweets revived talk that Mr. Trump may, in an attempt to end the investigation, move to have Mueller fired. But White House lawyer Ty Cobb sought late Sunday to tamp down the speculation by saying the president is not contemplating such a move.\n\n\"In response to media speculation and related questions being posed to the Administration, the White House yet again confirms that the President is not considering or discussing the firing of the Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.\"\n\nDeeply frustrated, Mr. Trump has fumed to confidants that the Mueller probe is \"going to choke the life out of\" his presidency if allowed to continue unabated indefinitely, according to an outside adviser who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations with the president.\n\nMr. Trump has long believed that the entrenched bureaucracy, particularly at the Justice Department and FBI, is out to thwart him. He fumed to one confidant after seeing a promotion for a forthcoming book by James Comey, the FBI director he fired last year, believing Comey will seek to enrich himself by besmirching Mr. Trump's reputation. Comey's yet-to-be-published book, \"A Higher Loyalty,\" topped Amazon.com's best-seller list on Sunday.\n\nThe president also has long been torn over how to approach the probe. His legal team, namely Cobb, has counseled Mr. Trump to cooperate with Mueller. But some former campaign advisers have urged Mr. Trump to be combative, warning that the investigation poses an existential threat to his presidency.\n\nMembers of Congress warned Mr. Trump to not even think about terminating Mueller.\n\n\"If he tried to do that, that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump ally.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., called for the passage of bipartisan bills designed to protect Mueller that have stalled in Congress.\n\n\"This president is engaged in desperate and reckless conduct to intimidate his law enforcement agencies of this country and to try and stop the special counsel. That is unacceptable in a democracy,\" Durbin said.\n\nMr. Trump's personal lawyer John Dowd called for Rosenstein to \"bring an end\" to the Russia investigation Saturday, adding to the tension.\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy, R-South Carolina, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, appeared on \"Fox News Sunday\" to address Mr. Trump personally.\n\n\"My advice to the president is the same thing I just told his lawyer: give Bob Mueller the time, the independence and the resources to do the very job. Keep in mind, Chris, he didn't volunteer for this,\" Gowdy said addressing host Chris Wallace. \"Give him the time, the resources, the independence to do his job, and when you are innocent, if the allegation is collusion with the Russians and there is no evidence of that, and you're innocent of that, act like it.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, issued a statement regarding Mr. Trump and his harsh words for Mueller to\u00a0the New York Times.\n\n\"As the speaker has always said, Mr. Mueller and his team should be able to do their job,\" a spokeswoman for Ryan told the Times.\n\nHis Senate counterpart, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has yet to comment on the ordeal.\n\nSen. Angus King, I-Maine, said on the CBS News broadcast \"Face the Nation\" Sunday it would be a \"huge mistake\" and \"a true constitutional crisis\" for the president to fire Mueller, whom he described as being \"as straight an arrow as there is in America.\"\n\nMr. Trump cannot directly fire Mueller, who can only be dismissed for cause. Any dismissal would have to be carried out by Rod Rosenstein, the Trump-appointed deputy attorney general who has publicly expressed support for Mueller.\n\nAides and friends say they understand Mr. Trump's frustration.\n\n\"When he says it's a political witch hunt, I think he's right,\" said Christopher Ruddy, CEO of the conservative news website Newsmax and a longtime Trump friend.\n\nMarc Short, Mr. Trump's congressional liaison, said the frustration is \"well-warranted\" because \"there has been no evidence whatsoever of collusion.\"\n\nMr. Trump may have felt emboldened after Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe on Friday, something Mr. Trump had clamored for out of a belief that McCabe was part of the entrenched, anti-Mr. Trump bureaucracy. \"A great day for Democracy,\" Mr. Trump tweeted afterward. Mr. Trump asserted without elaboration that McCabe knew \"all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!\"\n\nThe Associated Press later reported that McCabe kept personal memos detailing interactions with Mr. Trump that have been provided to Mueller's office and are similar to notes compiled by Comey. Mr. Trump sought to cast doubt on their veracity, tweeting Sunday that he spent \"very little time\" with McCabe \"but he never took notes when he was with me.\"\n\n\"I don't believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?\" Mr. Trump tweeted. It wouldn't be unusual for a senior official to make notes soon after meeting with the president.\n\nThe contents of McCabe's memos are unknown, but they could help substantiate McCabe's assertion that he was unfairly maligned by a White House he says had declared \"war\" on the FBI and Mueller's investigation.\n\nSessions said he dismissed McCabe on the recommendation of FBI disciplinary officials who said McCabe had not been candid with a watchdog office investigation. An upcoming inspector general's report is expected to conclude that McCabe had authorized the release of information to the media and was not forthcoming with the watchdog office as it examined the bureau's handling of an investigation into Clinton's emails.\n\nMcCabe has vigorously disputed the allegations and said his credibility came under attack as \"part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally\" but also the FBI and law enforcement.\n\nMueller is investigating whether Mr. Trump's actions, including Comey's ouster, constitute obstruction of justice.\n\nGraham spoke on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Durbin appeared on \"Fox News Sunday\" and Short was interviewed on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"", "link": null, "source": "CBS News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Will Rahn", "body": "The similarities between Joe Kennedy III and Donald Trump are, in a sense, obvious. Both are white men, northeasterners, teetotalers. They are products of the Ivy League and great wealth. They joined their respective family trades \u2013 real estate for Trump, politics for Joe III.\n\nThe differences are obvious too, and more illuminating. Joe III is a liberal avatar of American institutions: the Kennedy family, Stanford, Harvard Law. Self-effacing in person, he recognizes how easy his path has been \u2013 he only briefly served as an assistant DA before taking a House seat -- and had, until now, chosen to mitigate charges of nepotism by playing the part of diligent backbencher. The Kennedys, for all their famous faults, have the saving grace that comes from being in on the joke; when President Kennedy appointed his younger brother attorney general, he quipped that he was just trying to give Bobby some experience before he started practicing law.\n\nWhen they were on the rise, the Kennedys had little patience for norms. They were looking to build a dynasty, and were ruthless in the pursuit of that goal. While exhibiting the glamour of a great family, they were at heart arrivistes, and refused to adhere to patrician rules of political conduct.\n\nBut once in power, the Kennedys were interested not in tearing down establishment institutions, but in coopting and leading them. Their style of politics could be astonishingly vulgar \u2013 elections were rigged, brother replaced brother in the Senate without regard to appearances. However, when they stormed the castle, they kept the gates intact.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, threatens constantly to burn everything down. He flirts with suppression of the press through the changing of libel laws. He insinuates a \"deep state,\" our national security apparatus, conspires to take him down. He benefits from exacerbating mistrust in our institutions. He exploits the real and noticeable rot in our institutions \u2013 the media, the culture industry, the academy, the federal government. He feels the walls crumbling around him and looks to speed up the process.\n\nThe result is the great destabilization of the Trump era. Few, it seems, have a firm grasp on what is happening, let alone what might happen next. Everybody, regardless of their ideology, thinks they're losing. A realignment appears to be happening in our politics, but nobody can agree on what it looks like. \"We all feel the fault lines of a fractured country,\" as Joe III put it in his stilted, awkward speech on Tuesday night.\n\nA side effect of that realignment, at least in the short term, is that liberals are sounding more conservative in certain respects. They relentlessly defend the FBI, the CIA, the military. They rail against the threat posed by Russia. They look to Robert Mueller, a career national security bureaucrat, to save the country from Trump. They're even keen to ally with proponents of American military adventurism abroad, namely Trump's neoconservative critics like Bill Kristol.\n\nThere is, of course, an element of nostalgia in liberalism's newfound fondness for our institutions. Trump-era liberalism, with its emphasis on American global leadership and veneration of federal agencies and the mainstream press, would be easily recognizable to that first generation of Kennedys. And in that sense, it makes sense that Joe III would become a natural face of contemporary Democratic politics.\n\nTuesday night was an attempt to make Joe III a symbol of institutional resistance to Trump. To the question of whether the institutions are worth saving, and therefore capable of reform, Joe III's answer is an enthusiastic yes. He is, in a sense, already a symbol of how his own family has repaired itself from its reckless, impulsive, and selfish ways; he seems serious, he is sober. The message he sends is that his family, his party, and all the other institutions that nurtured him still have an innate and positive utility, an essential role to play. Where Trump says the rot must be amputated, Joe III promises that a strong dose of antibiotics is all that's needed.\n\nWhether this message resonates among the Democratic rank-and-file is another story. While the liberal commentariat, Joe III's natural constituency, remains fixated on norms and the need to defend institutions, a newly ascendant left sees civility as a neoliberal plot to uphold the status quo. And whereas Joe III and his ilk see Trump as an aberration, the left sees him as a symptom of a decayed political order they wish to abolish and replace.\n\nRobert Kennedy once said that he wished he had been born poor so he could have been a revolutionary. As his career advances, Joe III might harbor a similar desire, if only because his party is increasingly moving in a revolutionary direction.", "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/commentary-joe-kennedys-night-in-the-sun/", "source": "CBS News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Katiana Krawchenko", "body": "Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Ben Ray Lujan is predicting his party's candidate, Conor Lamb, will triumph in the special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district\u00a0Tuesday, launching a \"tide-turning moment\" for the historically Republican district.\n\n\"I think a loud message has already been sent,\" Lujan told CBS News Chief White House Correspondent Major Garrett on the latest episode of \"The Takeout\" podcast.\n\nThat message to the Republican in the race, Rick Saccone, and the GOP more broadly, he explained, became clear last week.\n\n\"The observation there that's been interesting especially when it comes to the tax debate in the country,\" Lujan noted, \"is Republicans were sending millions of dollars attacking Conor Lamb on this tax package and his tax message.

Some White House officials, including chief of staff John Kelly, were not fully briefed on the Commerce Department's plans, according to a senior administration official familiar with the process. This official was not authorized to publicly discuss the internal deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe possibility of an announcement, on an issue overseen by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, caught some top White House officials off guard and left several aides scrambling for details.\n\nKey Senate offices also did not receive advanced warning that Trump was expected to announce a decision before April deadlines.\n\nTrump was scheduled to meet with more than a dozen executives, including representatives from U.S. Steel Corp., Arcelor Mittal, Nucor, JW Aluminum and Century Aluminum.\n\nIncreased foreign production, especially by China, has driven down prices and hurt American producers, creating a situation the Commerce Department says poses a national security threat.\n\nTrump tweeted Thursday that many U.S industries, including steel and aluminum \"have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer.

Critics of such a move fear that other countries will retaliate or use national security as a pretext to impose trade penalties of their own. They also argue that sanctions on imports will drive up prices and hurt U.S. automakers and other companies that use steel or aluminum.\n\nThe Commerce Department recommended tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, higher tariffs on imports from specific countries or a quota on imports.\n\nRoss last month offered the president three options:\n\nMr. Trump last year ordered an investigation into whether aluminum and steel imports posed a threat to national defense. Ross said last month that the imports \"threaten to impair our national security,\" noting, for example, that only one U.S. company now produces a high-quality aluminum alloy needed for military aircraft.\n\nSection 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 gives the president authority to restrict imports and impose unlimited tariffs if a Commerce Department investigation finds a national security threat.", "link": null, "source": "CBS News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kathryn Watson", "body": "President Trump is hosting the Public Safety Medal of Valor Awards Ceremony Wednesday afternoon at the White House, in his first public appearance in Washington since his brief speech Thursday after the Parkland shooting.\n\nMr. Trump will be recognizing those who have earned the highest possible valor award for public safety, in an honor that the president or vice president typically gives according to the Justice Department. Last year, Mr. Trump granted the award to the agents who risked their lives to protect members of Congress in the June congressional baseball practice shooting.\n\nThe last time the president appeared publicly in Washington was Friday, to commemorate the victims of the shooting in Parkland, Fla., that took 17 lives. On Friday night, he visited the hospital where some of those injured in the shooting are recovering, and spoke with local members of law enforcement who intervened. Since then, the president has indicated he would support some form of background check measure.\n\nThe president is expected to appear in the East Room at 3:30 p.m.", "link": null, "source": "CBS News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kylie Atwood", "body": "Even before Secretary of State Rex Tillerson walked into the department's Foggy Bottom headquarters, he was in trouble.\n\nShortly after President Trump took office, 1,000 State Department employees signed a \"dissent cable\" in protest his ban on travel from a number of Muslim-majority countries. The decision had been ushered into law as an executive order even before Tillerson had been confirmed in February 2017. The White House spokesperson at the time, Sean Spicer, said State Department employees should \"either get with the program or they can go.\"\n\nThe situation pitted the White House against the State Department and the State Department against Tillerson, who was planning to retire as Exxon-Mobile's CEO when Mr. Trump tapped him to become America's top diplomat. Tillerson had no formal diplomatic experience, and aware of the discord in the department he was about to lead,\u00a0he immediately tried to mend fences.\n\nOn his first day at Foggy Bottom, Tillerson sheepishly introduced himself as \"the new guy\" in a speech to department staff. He knew that many of the people he was addressing had worked for Mr. Trump's election opponent, Hillary Clinton, when she was Secretary of State.\n\n\"Each of us is entitled to the expression of our political beliefs, but we cannot let our personal convictions overwhelm our ability to work as one team,\" Tillerson said at the time.\n\nBut team building was of secondary importance. First he had to endear himself to Mr. Trump, with whom he did not have a close relationship. Over the course of his tenure, Tillerson, who abides by the old western philosophy \"my word is my bond,\" spent a lot of his energy courting the president. It ended up being a go-nowhere effort that ended when Tillerson was sacked on Tuesday.\n\n\"He had to make Trump believe he was on his team, that he wasn't from the State Department where they thought everyone hated Trump,\" explained a State official. To that end, he had lunch with Mr. Trump weekly, talked with him on the phone most days, and tried to put in as much face-time as possible with the new president.\n\nYet they never really developed a rapport. The two men had marked differences in style, and policy differences became steadily more apparent. And then there was Jared Kushner: the president's top adviser and son-in-law, who quickly developed his own diplomatic profile.\n\nLike Tillerson, Kushner lacked a diplomatic background. Yet he quickly became the White House's point man on international issues ranging from the Middle East peace process to relations with Mexico and China. Friction was inevitable. Tillerson told Kushner the Chinese were duping him, souring their relationship further.\n\nTillerson, an engineer by training, was meticulous, a quality that ran counter to Mr. Trump's speedy entrepreneurial approach to most issues. They could never see eye-to-eye on perhaps the most pressing diplomatic concern, which was North Korea's nuclear program. Mr. Trump even embarrassed Tillerson on Twitter when he told him to \"stop wasting his time\" seeking a negotiated solution to the impasse -- at the time Tillerson was in the region.\n\nAnd Tillerson never completely followed Mr. Trump's lead. A week before he was fired, Tillerson told reporters that negotiations with North Korea were a long ways off. Later that same day Trump, accepted a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. When that surprise announcement came, Tillerson was sure to air a dose of skepticism, saying that the speed of Kim Jong Un's change in posture \"came as a little bit of a surprise.\" And Tillerson also warned of a victory lap: the regime had not reached out to confirm the meeting.\n\nMr. Trump and Tillerson had different methods to approaching almost every diplomatic challenge, which led to a series of policy disagreements between the two. They sparred over quitting the Paris Climate agreement, how to handle the Qatar blockade, how much to initially press for diplomacy with North Korea, and on Trump's instinct to ditch the Iran Nuclear Deal altogether.\n\n\"He and I have differences of views on things like [the Iran Deal] and how we should use it,\" Tillerson said last summer. \"But, I think, if we're not having those differences, I'm not sure I'm serving him.\"\n\nYet those initial differences on the Iran deal helped spur reporting of Tillerson's departure. Those rumors \u2013 perpetuated by Tillerson's opponents at the White House \u2013 remained in the Washington wind, with differing levels of intensity, until Tillerson's final day.\n\nTillerson spent his time fighting off the rumors of his impending departure. He called them \"ridiculous\" and tried to massage tensions with Mr. Trump. \"I'm not going anywhere,\" Tillerson said in response to a question from CBS News in July 2017, when he had only been on the job for 6 months.\n\nMeanwhile, State Department employees grew increasingly unhappy. By the time he left, Tillerson still hadn't filled seven of the top nine positions at the department. And the feeling of being sidelined, as foreign policy decisions were largely made within the walls of the White House, mounted among diplomats.\n\nForeign leaders and diplomats called the White House when they needed to get something done. In light of the administration's proposal to cut 30 percent of the State Department's budget, the former oil giant's plans to restructure the department, which he said were designed to make it more efficient, started to seem like an excuse to lay off experienced diplomats.\n\nTillerson, initially, did himself no favors with the State Department's staff. On his first few international trips, he did not visit U.S. embassy personnel. His recruited a team around him of State Department outsiders. He once told foreign service officers that he had no knowledge of how the State Department worked before getting there. He admitted, almost a year into the job, that he had not done enough to explain the purpose of the department overhaul to staffers.\n\nTillerson's was not without some accomplishments. In early 2017, he was able to convince the Trump administration to remove Iraq from the travel ban list in return for Iraq agreeing to open diplomatic conversation with the Saudis. But he did not want to call attention to incremental successes. At one point, he said the State Department hadn't put any \"wins on the board.\" A former aide explained that, for Tillerson, a real win would only be something monumental, like getting North Korea to denuclearize.\n\nAs a result of his reluctance to talk up his smaller victories coupled with fears of infuriating the White House, Tillerson primarily got attention through his attempts to save his relationship with Trump. When reports broke over the summer that Tillerson had called Mr. Trump a \"moron,\" there was a last-minute news conference at the State Department. Tillerson called Trump \"smart,\" but never denied that he had made the comments. Shortly after that, Mr. Trump told reporters he would like Tillerson to be a \"little tougher.\"\n\nTheir relationship would never really improve, leading Mr. Trump to unceremoniously fire Tillerson on Twitter. In his outgoing remarks that afternoon, Tillerson thanked State Department personnel and Department of Defense counterparts, but notably he never mentioned the Mr. Trump by name.\n\n\"I'll now return to private life as a private citizen, as a proud American, proud of the opportunity I've had to serve my country,\" Tillerson said. After 14 tumultuous months on the job, he left without taking questions from reporters.", "link": null, "source": "CBS News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Margaret Brennan", "body": "WASHINGTON --\u00a0 On Wall Street, many investors headed for the exits Thursday.
