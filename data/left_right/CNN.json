[{"author": "Jeremy Diamond", "body": "\"I love the President and wish him well,\" Dowd said in a statement to CNN.\n\nDowd's resignation comes as Trump has stepped up his attacks on special counsel Robert Mueller and days after Dowd said in a statement the investigation should end, initially claiming he was speaking for the President before saying he was only speaking for himself.\n\n\"John Dowd is a friend and has been a valuable member of our legal team. We will continue our ongoing representation of the President and our cooperation with the Office of Special Counsel,\" said Jay Sekulow, counsel to the President.\n\nTrump's attorneys are in the midst of negotiations with the special counsel's team over a potential interview with the President.\n\nIt was not immediately clear who would take over as the President's lead personal attorney, but Trump earlier this week hired another veteran Washington attorney, Joseph diGenova, to join his legal team. diGenova was expected to play a forward-facing role on the legal team, filling what Trump felt was a lack of voices publicly defending him and challenging the special counsel. DiGenova had publicly argued that Trump had been \"framed\" by FBI and Justice Department officials. and and The New York Times and The Washington Post first reported Dowd's resignation. Dowd previously was criticized for his handling of the response to the guilty plea of Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who became the first Trump administration official to face charges in Mueller's investigation. The President first shook up his legal team over the summer, removing Marc Kasowitz as his lead attorney in the matter. Dowd landed himself and the President in hot water after a tweet he says he authored suggested Trump knew Flynn lied to the FBI in January, reviving questions of whether Trump committed obstruction of justice when he allegedly asked then-FBI Director James Comey to drop the Flynn investigation. \"I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies,\" the tweet on Trump's account said. The tweet led Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, to note that the committee is investigating obstruction of justice and said: \"What we're beginning to see is the putting together of a case of obstruction of justice.\" In a testy exchange with CNN, Dowd said he authored the tweet, but then suggested it was incorrect, claiming that \"at the time of the firing no one including Justice had accused Flynn of lying.\" He declined to answer additional questions, saying: \"Enough already ... I don't feed the haters.\" The response was characteristic of Dowd's hard-charging style, which initially endeared him to the President and made him the lead attorney on the President's legal team after Trump all but discarded Kasowitz in July. The latest shake-up now leaves questions about whether Trump's legal team will pursue the strategy that Dowd laid out in the wake of Flynn's guilty plea, when Dowd claimed that Trump could not be prosecuted for obstruction of justice because he is the US President and therefore its \"chief law enforcement officer.\" Dowd's claim signaled the President's legal team plans to rely on an untested theory that is heavily disputed by legal scholars: whether a sitting President can be charged with obstruction of justice or indicted at all.", "link": null, "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Doug Criss", "body": "(CNN) It sounds like the kind of legislation that should easily breeze through a statehouse, even in these politically divided times: a resolution denouncing white nationalists and neo-Nazis .\n\nIt didn't even make it out of committee in the Tennessee legislature.\n\n\"[W]e urge law enforcement to recognize these white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups as terrorist organizations and to pursue the criminal elements of these domestic terrorist organizations in the same manner and with the same fervor used to protect the United States from other manifestations of terrorism.\"\n\nBut when it came up Wednesday before the House State Government Subcommittee , it died a quick death.

That report -- the details of which have not been publicly released -- is said to conclude that McCabe misled investigators about his role in directing other officials at the FBI to speak to The Wall Street Journal about his involvement in a public corruption investigation into the Clinton Foundation, according to a source briefed on it.\n\nCNN reported on Wednesday that the findings in Horowitz's report on McCabe were referred to the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility, staffed with career officials, who recommended McCabe's termination. McCabe, accompanied by his lawyer, tried making a last-ditch effort Thursday to avoid the firing, meeting with officials at the deputy attorney general's office at the Justice Department for several hours while Sessions was traveling, but to no avail. Horowitz's office is continuing to investigate how the Justice Department and FBI handled sensitive investigations leading up to the 2016 presidential election -- including the probe into Hillary Clinton's private email server -- and a more global report is expected this spring. That closely watched report, which Trump has derided as \" already late ,\" could prove devastating for former and current top officials at the Justice Department and FBI depending on the findings, as the President has sought to weave a narrative of biased \"deep state\" holdovers from the Obama administration determined to undermine his presidency. While former FBI officials say a lack of candor is a death knell for an agent's career, Sessions' decision to fire McCabe presented unique political complications. Trump often used McCabe as a political punching bag on the campaign trail given his wife's purported past ties to Clinton -- going so far as heckling Sessions over the summer for failing to fire McCabe -- despite the fact that Trump had interviewed McCabe just weeks prior about serving as FBI director after he ousted James Comey. In December, Trump made a cryptic reference to McCabe's approaching retirement, tweeting: \"FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!\" The full implications of McCabe's firing on his pension remain to be seen, but he could potentially stand to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars.

A week ago, he was deported.\n\nFor more than 20 years, his life has been a legal battle. But with the help of an Ohio congressman, he was able to remain in the US. That all changed when US President Donald Trump took office last year and doubled down on immigration.\n\nImmigration arrests have increased by 42% since Trump took office, according to the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nIn the 1980s, Adi held a green card.

When he returned, Adi tried to apply for a new card, but was rejected.\n\nImmigration officials accused him of having a sham marriage with his American ex-wife.\n\nHis ex-wife had signed a statement\u00a0alleging marriage fraud. According to Adi, his lawyer and multiple media interviews with Adi's ex-wife, she was coerced into making the statement after immigration officials showed up at her door.\n\nIn 2007, she signed an affidavit retracting her statement and denying the marriage was fraudulent.\n\nDespite the affidavit, he was unable to gain legal status.

He was, instead, required to routinely check in with the agency, which he was diligent about, according to his lawyer David Leopold. In 2013, Ryan presented a private bill -- legislation specific to a person and not affecting overall policy -- to Congress, which would get him a more thorough review of his case. He has presented the bill several times since then.\n\nHaving the private bill in motion meant Adi was granted a two-year stay. Under Trump, though, ICE reduced the deportation stay to six months, according to Ryan.\n\nLast September, an ICE field office put an ankle bracelet with a GPS monitor on Adi.

In each review, the courts have held that Adi does not have a legal basis to remain in the US,\" ICE said the statement.\n\nAdi's last few months were a rollercoaster of emotions, expecting deportation amid the ramped-up crackdown on illegal immigration\u00a0across the US as part of the Trump administration's stance on the issue.\n\nAdi and his second wife Fidaa, a US citizen, arranged to leave the United States at their own expense in early January. They sold the family home and prepared to say goodbye to everyone.\n\n\"ICE agents were to meet them at the airport and remove his ankle bracelet before he boarded the flight,\" Adi's attorney told CNN. \"On January 4th, ICE called to say that they canceled the departure date -- that he should not depart as scheduled and that no new date was set.\"\n\nBut according to Leopold, Adi was asked instead to report to ICE local headquarters on January 15\u00a0for a routine check-in to discuss the case. Adi was escorted by several supporters including Ryan, but he was taken into custody without being given a reason.\n\nAdi was not able to see his family before being put on a plane to Amman on January 30.\n\nOver the past year tens of thousands have been arrested by ICE, according to Human Rights Watch. Many, like Adi, are deeply rooted in their communities and have no criminal convictions.\n\nLast year, ICE's deputy Director Thomas D. Homan\u00a0said that under Trump's administration, undocumented immigrants \"should be afraid,\" explaining that anyone who has violated the law should be looking over their shoulder. ICE has made clear that while they still prioritize criminals, they also prioritize undocumented immigrants with final deportation orders and do not consider anyone exempt from being arrested or put into deportation proceedings.\n\n\"I don't think there is any question that this is the new normal ... To watch these families get ripped apart is the most heart-breaking thing any American citizen could ever see ...

I built this whole thing scratch from nothing. Even if anybody wants to stop that American dream, I won't let them.

In fact, Kellyanne's statements actually show her intention and desire to comply with the Hatch Act -- as she twice declined to respond to the host's specific invitation to encourage Alabamans to vote for the Republican.\"\n\nThe announcement makes Conway the latest high-profile member of Trump's team to face official criticism over violating the Hatch Act, a 1939 law prohibiting federal employees from using their official government capacity for partisan ends. Both White House social media director Dan Scavino and US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley have received reprimands or warnings from OSC for political statements on their official social media accounts.\n\nDuring the \"Fox & Friends\" interview November 20, Conway was introduced by the show's hosts as a \"counselor to President Trump\" and spoke from White House grounds. She said about Democratic Senate candidate Doug Jones: \"Folks, don't be fooled. He'll be a vote against tax cuts. He's weak on crime, weak on borders. He's strong on raising your taxes. He's terrible for property owners.\"\n\nDuring the \"New Day\" interview December 6, Conway -- again speaking from White House grounds and introduced by CNN anchor Chris Cuomo as \"counselor to President Trump\" -- said among other things that Jones will be a reliable vote \"for tax hikes,\" \"against border security,\" \"against national security,\" \"against the Second Amendment\" and \"against life,\" according to the OSC report.\n\nConway went on to tell Cuomo that Jones is \"out of step for Alabama voters, according to the President,\" and that Trump \"doesn't want a liberal Democrat representing Alabama in the United States Senate.\"\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel is unrelated to the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, and is an independent agency with purview of the Hatch Act.\n\nConway faced a similar situation last year, when she used a Fox News appearance in February to plug Ivanka Trump's clothing line.

There needs to be a change. People need to feel safe.

And his aggression in recent days shows he has rejected an alternative course of action: muting his natural inclination to go on the offensive while Mueller deliberates his fate.\n\nSo as the President slips political constraints by shuffling his White House and foreign policy team and rages against convention, Mueller and his investigators have Trump penned in with no easy means of escape. CNN reported on Monday that Mueller's team sat down with Trump's lawyers to discuss topics investigators could inquire of the President, a clear sign the investigation isn't likely to end anytime soon.\n\nBut cornered prey can be unpredictable and prone to desperate acts, so Trump's behavior is stoking concerns that he is not just hinting that he may can Mueller -- he may actually do it.\n\n\"We are fast approaching a crossroads ... where the United States is going to have to be confronted with a decision about whether we value the rule of law,\" Richard Ben-Veniste, a former Watergate special prosecutor, told CNN's Erin Burnett on Monday.\n\n\"This continued attack against Mueller, against the Department of Justice and against the FBI is a pretext for Mr Trump eventually to fire Mr. Mueller, I believe.\"\n\nTrying to forcibly end the special counsel investigation would set up the ultimate test of the Republican Party's so far staunch unwillingness to desert its President, and could have a huge impact on the political environment for November's midterm elections.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said there was \"no collusion\" between his campaign and Russia and no other wrongdoing. If that is the case, allowing Mueller to finish his investigation would provide vindication. But it's obvious that Trump sees the probe as so unfair and a conspiracy against him that is damaging his presidency -- a factor that may be inducing him to act as if he has something to hide, even if he doesn't.\n\nAnd sitting powerless, while Mueller indicts people in his outer circle, pores over his financial records and looms ever closer to the Oval Office by the week is a scenario that is clearly driving Trump to distraction.\n\nSo it's reasonable to assume that diGenova's appointment represents Trump's frustration with his legal team and his limited options, following a weekend of conflicting statements from its members on the issue of Mueller's continued employment.\n\nThe President's fury over his plight erupted in a series of attacks on Mueller over the weekend, culminating in an anguished tweet Monday lambasting an investigation he believes is part of an establishment plot to destroy him.\n\n\"A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!\" Trump wrote, apparently testing out a rationale for the firing of Mueller, days after he singled out the special counsel by name in his attacks for the first time.\n\nIf that was a trial balloon for anything more than an effort to discredit Mueller's eventual findings, the President got a swift answer as several senior GOP senators warned that trying to rid himself of the Mueller probe would be disastrous.\n\nSen. John Cornyn of Texas said it would be a \"bad idea\" for Trump to sack Mueller, while Maine Sen. Susan Collins said such a step would be a \"a terribly serious mistake.\"\n\nGOP senators who don't have to face Trump voters anymore had more freedom. Utah's Orrin Hatch, for instance, said terminating Mueller would be \"the stupidest thing\" the President could do.\n\nToppling Mueller, with its constitutional implication of a President trying to evade accountability, would make the uproar following former FBI Director James Comey's firing last year pale by comparison. After all, jettisoning the former FBI director demonstrably made Trump's political and legal exposure over the Russia investigation much worse.\n\nIn fact, the only potential scenario in which Trump could benefit by firing Mueller would be if he does indeed have something to hide from the special counsel and he is able to permanently derail the investigation.\n\n\"Let's posit for a moment that there is something there ... in which case it is not the stupidest thing in the world to attack Mueller,\" David Priess, a former senior CIA officer and national security and intelligence author, told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Monday.\n\n\"There may be something much worse out there, in which case this is not a stupid strategy at all. This would be protecting against the worst case scenario,\" Priess said.\n\nAny attempt to dismiss Mueller would be complicated, however, and would require Trump to get rid of Attorney General Jeff Sessions -- who recused himself from involvement in 2016 election investigations -- and replace him with an interim successor who would consent to ordering the end of the investigation.\n\nIf the President is unwilling to go that far, the hiring of diGenova at least could settle his nerves and offer him an outspoken defender to bolster his under-gunned counterattack in the media.\n\nDiGenova is just the latest new entrant in Trump's circle who shares the President's combative mindset and is likely to take a far more aggressive public stance in defense of Trump than his current legal team has done.\n\nLike new top economic adviser Larry Kudlow, diGenova is a talented performer on television. He's a regular on Fox News, the President's favorite source of political intelligence. Like Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo, he doesn't mince words and his appointment fits the President's emerging pattern of surrounding himself with subordinates who mirror his bravado and combativeness.\n\nShowing his stomach for the fight, diGenova on Monday slammed what he said was disarray at the FBI under its director, Christopher Wray.\n\n\"What does that tell you about the FBI director? It tells you he is a coward,\" diGenova told WMAL radio.\n\nDiGenova shares Trump's disdain for Comey, as well, once calling Comey his \"own hagiographer\" and a \"danger to this country\" on Fox.\n\nDiGenova also has advanced conspiracy theories that the Russia investigation is an FBI plot to delegitimize Trump's presidency.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/20/politics/donald-trump-robert-mueller-lawyer/index.html", "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Terence Burlij", "body": "Washington (CNN) The results of Tuesday's special election in western Pennsylvania offer an ominous sign for Republican hopes of defending the House this fall.

Trump carried it by 4 points in 2016, but this district has several characteristics that suggest a strong shift is coming.

Democrats still have a crowded primary to sort out, but they'll be watching the Detroit suburbs closely. Race moves from Toss-Up to Lean Democratic.\n\nMN-03: Republican Erik Paulsen won this district comprising the suburbs west of the Twin Cities by 14 points in 2016 -- but Hillary Clinton bested Trump here by nine points. It also went narrowly for Obama in 2012. Democrats are touting Dean Phillips, the former CEO of his family's distillery company and former co-owner of Talenti Gelato. He's keeping close in fundraising, trailing Paulsen by about $90,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017, but has a cash-on-hand deficit of more than $900,000.

Jeff Van Drew on its Red-to-Blue list. The moderate Democrat, a gun rights supporter, does have a primary against Tanzie Youngblood. There is a crowded field on the GOP side. This district, which includes Atlantic City and some Philadelphia exurbs, went for Obama by eight points and Trump by four.

The former assistant secretary of state in the Obama administration saw two primary opponents drop out last month and endorse him -- that after he more than doubled GOP Rep. Leonard Lance in fundraising during the final quarter of last year. Hillary Clinton won this north central New Jersey district by a single point in 2016 while Lance won it by 11 points. Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-Up.\n\nNC-09: This is a tough district for Democrats. But so was Pennsylvania 18. Democrat Dan McCready is a top recruit who has outraised GOP Rep. Robert Pittenger for three consecutive quarters and has $600,000 more in the bank. Pittenger also faces a primary challenge from Mark Harris, who he defeated in the 2016 GOP primary by a single percentage point. The district includes South Charlotte and shares a border with South Carolina -- a similar dynamic to what Democrats were facing in PA-18. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.\n\nNC-13: Freshman GOP Rep. Ted Budd won this north central North Carolina district by 12 points in 2016 as Trump was carrying it by nine. Democrats are lining up behind Kathy Manning, a philanthropist and former lawyer, who crushed Budd in fundraising in the fourth quarter of 2017 and has roughly $220,000 more cash-on-hand. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.\n\nPA-17: The dust hasn't settled from Tuesday's special election, but regardless of the result it shows Democratic strength in southwestern Pennsylvania. This newly-drawn district is a much more competitive seat for GOP Rep. Keith Rothfus to defend. Assuming Conor Lamb decides to run in this district that includes suburbs west of Pittsburgh, it will be one of the most closely-watched contests come November. Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-Up.\n\nVA-07: This district that includes Richmond suburbs has been trending Democratic in recent years. Trump's performance here dipped from Romney's showing four years earlier. Republican Ed Gillespie won it by less than four points in last year's gubernatorial contest. GOP Rep. Dave Brat stunned the political world when he knocked off Eric Cantor in the GOP primary in 2014. Now he's poised for a challenge of his own from one of two Democrats who outraised him at the end of last year -- former CIA officer Abigail Spanberger or Marine Corps veteran Dan Ward. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.\n\nWI-01: This is House Speaker Paul Ryan's district, and it's likely to stay that way in November. Ryan can raise as much money as he wants, is universally known in his district and won't make the mistake of sleeping on Democratic challenger Randy Bryce. But Bryce has some things going for him, too. He's branded himself effectively (the mustachioed ironworker and Army veteran's Twitter handle is @IronStache). His longshot bid against Ryan will make him a small-dollar fundraising star. And southeastern Wisconsin is actually friendlier territory to Democrats than southwestern Pennsylvania was. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.\n\nIn addition to those moves, we are shifting FL-06 and TX-21 from Safe Republican to Likely Republican. In Florida, GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis is leaving his seat to run for governor -- and Democrats believe former ambassador Nancy Soderberg gives them a chance in this open contest. While in Texas, Rep. Lamar Smith's retirement creates an open seat with May runoffs for Republicans and Democrats to determine who will face-off for this district that includes parts of Austin and area north of San Antonio. Smith won the district by 21 points; Trump won it by 10.\n\nGiven the current national environment we are also moving several Democratic-held seats to more favorable positions. Two open seats -- NV-03 and NH-01 -- go from Toss-Up to Lean Democratic. Democrats are happy with the candidates running in those districts, and in the case of New Hampshire, no Republican candidate seems to have caught fire.\n\nTwo other seats with Democratic incumbents seeking reelection move from Lean Democratic to Likely Democratic: FL-07 and NJ-05. For Republicans, the name of the game in 2018 is defense, not offense, with two open Democratic seats in Minnesota representing the GOP's best pick-up opportunities.\n\nThose are today's moves, but there are a number of other races we're watching closely to see whether they inch in Democrats' direction. In Utah, Ben McAdams (challenging GOP Rep. Mia Love in the 4th District) has run well with Mitt Romney on the ballot before. In central Arkansas' 2nd District, Clarke Tucker was Democrats' dream recruit to take on two-term Rep. French Hill. Two Ohio races -- the 1st District, where Aftab Pureval is challenging Rep. Steve Chabot in what used to be solidly Republican Cincinnati suburbs, and the 12th District, where voters will replace retired Rep. Pat Tiberi in an August special election -- bear watching. In KY-06, we're waiting to see whether Lexington Mayor Jim Gray or veteran Amy McGrath wins the primary. And in KS-02, Democratic challenger Paul Davis is worth keeping an eye on, in part because he's already made clear that, like Lamb, he's opposing Pelosi. Democrats had struggled to recruit a strong challenger to Rep. David Valadao in CA-21, a Central Valley district, businessman TJ Cox \u2014 who'd been running in the 10th District against Rep. Jeff Denham \u2014 changed his mind and said he'll move from Modesto back home to Fresno and run against Valadao in this district Hillary Clinton won by 15 percentage points.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct a rating change in the text for IL-12 and in the graphic for NJ-02.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/16/politics/house-key-races-pennsylvania-results-update/index.html", "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Veronica Stracqualursi", "body": "\"The funds were taken from my home equity line and transferred internally to my LLC account in the same bank,\" Michael Cohen said in a statement.\n\nCohen also confirmed that he used his Trump Organization email account to communicate details of a payment transfer to Stephanie Clifford, the adult film star known as Stormy Daniels, who allegedly had an affair with the President before his time in office.\n\nEarlier Friday, Clifford's lawyer, Michael Avenatti, provided an email to CNN in which Cohen confirmed the transfer to Daniels' former attorney, Keith Davidson. In the email, both Cohen's personal email account and trumporg.com email account were used. The deposit was confirmed to Cohen by a First Republic Bank employee.\n\nCohen responded later Friday, saying that he regularly used his business email account for personal matters.\n\n\"I sent emails from the Trump Org email address to my family, friends as well as Trump business emails. I basically used it for everything. I am certain most people can relate,\" he said. Avenatti, speaking on MSNBC, said Cohen's use of his business email to conduct this transaction could be an indication that he was acting in an official capacity as a legal counsel to Trump when he transferred the money to Clifford. While this development brings the payment to Clifford closer to Trump himself, it is not proof that he knew about it. Any involvement by Trump would indicate the payment was an in-kind campaign contribution which was not disclosed to the Federal Election Commission, which would be a violation of federal law, according to Paul S. Ryan, a campaign finance attorney who works for Common Cause. The email does not say where the funds originated from. Law firm handling Stormy Daniels case for Cohen also did legal work with Trump campaign NBC News first reported Cohen's use of the email account. The day after the email, Cohen wired money from First Republic Bank to Davidson's bank account, according to NBC News. Davidson did not respond to a request for comment from CNN. First Republic Bank declined to comment to the network. Trump's 2017 financial disclosures listed an account at First Republic Bank, valued between $15,001 and $50,000. Cohen also regularly used that same email account to negotiate with Clifford last year before she signed a nondisclosure agreement, NBC News reported. Last month, Cohen said he wired Clifford $130,000 of his own money right before the 2016 election in exchange for her silence about the alleged affair. Cohen said Friday that he is in the midst of a \"witch hunt,\" saying, \"These incessant attacks against me are meritless and are concocted by the liberal mainstream media to continue to malign our President and distract the country from his historic achievements over the past year. This witch hunt has now gone from ludicrous to insane.\" He has denied the Trump Organization's involvement in the payment, and both Cohen and the White House have denied any sexual encounter between the President and Clifford. \"In a private transaction in 2016, I used my own personal funds to facilitate a payment of $130,000 to Ms. Stephanie Clifford,\" Cohen said in a statement in February. \"Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly.\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that \"arbitration was won in the President's favor\" regarding the case. The statement is an admission that the nondisclosure agreement exists and that it directly involves Trump.

Mike Crapo, the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, passed 67 to 31, marking a rare occurrence of old-fashioned legislating on a bipartisan bill that nevertheless sharply divided Democrats.\n\nThe legislation will now move to the House, where it will need to be reconciled with possible fixes proposed by Rep. Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nA White House press secretary said in a statement that President Donald Trump supports Crapo's bill and would sign it into law. Still, the White House left the door open to possible changes that could be made by House lawmakers as long as the bipartisan bill reaches the president's desk \"as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe proposal provides long-awaited relief to thousands of community banks and dozens of regional lenders including Zions Bancorp, BB&T and SunTrust. It will also loosen regulations for mortgage lenders, expand access to free credit freezes for Americans and change rules for student loan defaults.\n\n\"This bill shows that we can work together and can do big things that make a big difference in the lives of people across this country,\" said Crapo on the Senate floor ahead of the vote.\n\nThe bill's passage was a defeat for progressive Democrats, who strongly opposed easing regulations for some banks, warning that doing so would likely trigger another financial crisis.\n\n\"This legislation threatens to undo important rules protecting us from risk,\" Sen. Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the banking panel, said earlier this week on the Senate floor. \"This legislation again puts taxpayers on the hook for bailouts.\"\n\nProgressives pointed to several critical changes in the bill that would release more than two dozen regional banks from stricter oversight by the Fed and would make it easier for Wall Street banks to fight off existing regulations.\n\n\"Buried down in the details of the bill are more landmines for American families\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said on the Senate floor ahead of the chamber's vote. \"Washington has become completely disconnected from the real problem in people's lives.\"\n\nThe bill raises the threshold at which banks are considered too big to fail. That trigger, once set at $50 billion in assets, would rise to $250 billion. It would leave only a dozen US banks -- including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo -- facing the strictest regulations.\n\nThe measure would also shield more than two dozen banks from some Fed oversight under the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory law. Those banks would no longer be required to have plans to be safely dismantled if they fail. And they would have to take the Fed's bank health test only periodically, not once a year.\n\nModerate Democrats accused progressives of overstating provisions in the bill and the likely impact it could have on the economy. Instead, they argued they have to respond to the distinct political and banking needs in their states, which they say have been hurt by consolidation in the banking industry since the law was passed.\n\n\"They don't understand where we live,\" said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a moderate Democrat from North Dakota who is up for re-election, on the chamber floor. \"They don't understand who we are. They don't understand we live in communities and that we support and protect each other. Instead, they write one regulation that's supposed to be one-size-fits-all.\"\n\nMany of the measure's Democratic cosponsors hail from rural states won by Trump. Their support for the long-sought changes may demonstrate to their voters, many who voted for Trump, that they can work with the President and not reflexively oppose anything he supports.\n\nAhead of Wednesday's vote, Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, defended his support for the bill, arguing he would never back remedies that would put the financial system at risk.\n\n\"Let me be clear that I will do nothing and support no legislation that seriously undermines or cuts back on the provisions and the systemic protections that were put in place,\" Warner said on the chamber floor. \"But eight years later ... there is widespread agreement that some of the standards we set in Dodd-Frank needed time for review.\"\n\nThose cap changes include exempting community banks with $10 billion or less in assets from having to comply with the so-called Volcker Rule, a regulation that bars financial institutions from making risky bets with money insured by taxpayers.\n\nIt also stops banks that originate 500 or fewer mortgages each year from having to collect racial data on their loans. Under a 1975 law, financial institutions are required to report the race, ethnicity and ZIP codes of borrowers so regulators can make sure they aren't discriminating in lending.\n\nSome new consumer protections were also added to the bill including offering Americans free credit freezes and barring lenders from declaring a student loan in default when a co-signer dies or declares bankruptcy.\n\nIt's not just progressives who've highlighted negative consequences from the changes to the bill.

Van der Zwaan must stay in Washington, DC, and Manhattan, where his attorneys are based, until his sentencing, and a judge must review his requests to travel elsewhere within the United States. His sentencing is set at a relatively early date, because his wife is facing a difficult pregnancy in London, his defense attorney told the judge.\n\nHis wife, Eva Kahn, the daughter of Russian billionaire German Khan, is due in August.\n\nVan der Zwaan becomes the fourth guilty plea in the Mueller investigation after Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos and former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to investigators last year, and an online supplier of fake usernames pleaded guilty to identity fraud last week. Mueller has also indicted 13 Russians for their work to influence the 2016 presidential election through online social media.\n\nUnlike other defendants, Van der Zwaan did not enter into an ongoing cooperation agreement with the special counsel's office.\n\nVan der Zwaan's conversation with the special counsel's office in which he allegedly lied happened three days after Manafort and Gates were charged with crimes related to their work for Ukrainian politicians and other business. Both have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn early November, prosecutors questioned van der Zwaan on his work with international law firm Skadden Arps. They were investigating Manafort's, Gates' and other individuals' compliance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which governs foreign lobbying and propaganda work for foreign governments in the US, and wanted to know who paid for a Ukrainian report on the trial of a former prime minister and how it was paid for, prosecutors said in court Tuesday.\n\nVan der Zwaan spoke with the special counsel's office a second time in early December to confess to his inaccuracies and what he knew, according to prosecutors' statements in court and a plea agreement released Tuesday.\n\nManafort arranged for the law firm to help the Ukrainian minister of justice in 2012 report on the trial of Yulia Tymoshenko, a former Ukrainian prime minister opposed to Manafort's clients.\n\nAt least one public relations firm worked on the rollout of Skadden's report with Gates and Manafort. In total, Manafort and Gates funneled $4 million to facilitate the rollout of the Ukrainian report in the US and Europe, prosecutors said Tuesday.\n\nVan der Zwaan worked with Manafort, Gates and the public relations firm in 2012 to fashion a public spin on the Ukrainian report without his law firm's knowledge.\n\nHe had given a public relations firm a copy of the report before its public release, and handed Gates talking points about the report that would help the Ukrainian clients, against the direction of a more senior lawyer at the Skadden law firm, according to court documents and prosecutors' descriptions in court.\n\nTymoshenko, the subject of the report, is one of the top political rivals of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a Russian sympathizer who used Manafort and Gates as political consultants for more than a decade. After Yanukovych narrowly defeated Tymoshenko in the 2010 presidential election, she was jailed on charges of corruption that were seen by many as being politically motivated.\n\nSkadden produced a report -- intended to be independent -- that said the process was legal. She was freed after Yanukovych's ouster in 2014.\n\nThe prosecutors' criminal charge Tuesday explains how van der Zwaan was in touch with Gates and an unnamed colleague of Gates' who was principally based in Ukraine again in September 2016. They discussed how a criminal complaint in Ukraine could implicate a former Ukrainian official, Skadden and Manafort himself. The calls were encrypted, and van der Zwaan recorded them and took notes, prosecutors said. At the time, Gates was working with the Trump campaign. Van der Zwaan had first told prosecutors his last interaction with Gates was an \"innocuous text message\" in August 2016, leaving out his involvement in the Ukrainian legal discussion. Van Der Zwaan also deleted and then failed to produce emails he exchanged in Russian in September 2016 with the unnamed person, called \"Person A\" in court. One of them discussed how the Ukrainian criminal court action was \"essentially the tip of the iceberg,\" prosecutor Andrew Weissmann said in court Tuesday. When asked by prosecutors why they hadn't seen those emails, van der Zwaan told them he had no idea, and that he hadn't responded to the business associate. But he \"knew full well why we didn't get it,\" Weissmann said Tuesday. Throughout van der Zwaan's court appearance, the navy-suited defendant leaned far back in his chair and removed his glasses as the judge reviewed his paperwork. At other times, he stood beside his criminal defense attorney William Schwartz to respond to the judge that he understood his plea and his legal rights. Around the time of the conversations van der Zwaan lied about, Manafort was in the spotlight for the work he and Gates did in Ukraine. The New York Times reported that secret documents uncovered in Ukraine listed millions of dollars in illegal payments meant for Manafort, and CNN reported that Manafort's lobbying firm was under scrutiny by the FBI and Justice Department. Days after these reports in mid-August 2016, Manafort resigned from the Trump campaign. There's no indication from the document that van der Zwaan was in touch with Gates about the political adviser's work in the election, though the charging document is the first evidence that prosecutors have sought -- and potentially even received emails and recorded phone calls related to -- Gates' interactions while he worked for Donald Trump. The separate charges Gates faces in federal court involve activities related to his Ukrainian work with Manafort in years prior to their Trump campaign work. By the numbers: The Trump orbit's contacts with Russians Skadden Arps said in a statement Tuesday that the firm terminated van der Zwaan's employment last year and is cooperating with authorities. Van der Zwaan was based in London for the firm. He is the son-in-law of Russian billionaire German Khan, who is one of the most prominent businessmen in Russia. Khan co-founded Alfa Group, a large financial conglomerate, and was recently named in the Treasury Department's list of Russian oligarchs. CNN reported last year that the FBI examined whether there was a computer server connection during the 2016 presidential campaign between Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization, though there isn't any indication that van der Zwaan is connected to that matter. Asked about the charge, White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah told Fox News that the development is unrelated to the President's actions and \"only reinforces our point when it comes to the special counsel's investigation ... there is no evidence of collusion because none existed.\" Gates, meanwhile, has had attorneys working on a plea deal with Mueller's office for more than a month, indicating he's poised to cooperate in the investigation, sources familiar with the case told CNN last week. But no deal has materialized as of Tuesday morning. He has already spoken to Mueller's team about his case multiple times, CNN first reported last week. His cooperation could be another building block for Mueller in a possible case against Trump or key members of his team. The many unearthed interactions between Trump-world and Russia, documented It would also increase the pressure to cooperate on Manafort, who has pleaded not guilty to Mueller's indictment and is preparing for a trial on alleged financial crimes unrelated to the campaign. Gates pleaded not guilty on October 30 alongside Manafort. On Friday night, Mueller's office indicated it had unearthed even more evidence of alleged crimes committed by Manafort, related to bank fraud and mortgages on his homes.

The hypocrisy hangs in the air and chokes anyone with a sense of decency or intellectual honesty.\"\n\nHe is 100% right.\n\nThe simple fact is that Republicans in the Obama era defined themselves primarily as committed to reducing government spending and shrinking the nation's debt. The ur-document of that age was Paul Ryan's budget, in which he proudly touted the need to confront entitlement spending and make the hard cuts necessary to keep the country solvent for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"Our debt is a threat to this country,\" Ryan said in a 2013 speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference. \"We have to tackle this problem before it tackles us.\" He was far from alone. Republicans insisted that any spending legislation -- even for disaster relief -- be paid for with budget offsets. Every major Republican leader talked about debt and deficit relentlessly. That focus on deficit reduction and spending restraint bled into the 2016 primary as the top tier candidates -- including Paul -- championed it. One candidate, however, did not. That candidate was Donald Trump, the self-proclaimed \"king of debt.\" Trump showed little care or concern for the issue that had animated the party he was running to lead. So cavalier was Trump about the deficit that Mitt Romney, the party's 2012 presidential nominee, lambasted him for it in a speech aimed at convincing Republicans to drop Trump \"His tax plan in combination with his refusal to reform entitlements and honestly address spending would balloon the deficit and the national debt,\" said Romney. And then Trump won. Not just the Republican primary, but the election. And suddenly his priorities -- immigration, trade protectionism and a tax cut -- became the party's principles. Curtailing spending and reducing debt went out the window -- or at least way down the list of what the GOP cared about. And Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and almost the entire rest of the Republican Party -- sans Paul and a handful of House conservatives -- went along for the ride. Which is how it came to pass that just before 6 p.m. Thursday, McConnell was on the Senate floor pleading with his home-state colleague to drop his push for a vote on an amendment that would maintain the current budget caps. Paul's issue was a simple one: A two-year spending bill that would increase the federal deficit by more than $300 billion was being rammed through at the last minute -- and without any amendments being offered. And he's right about that too. The natural result of our current style of governing -- lurching from crisis to crisis -- is this sort of showdown. Paul is right that it is absolutely ridiculous that a near-700-page piece of legislation that senators got their hands on around midnight Wednesday should be passed by midnight Thursday. And yet, when you are faced with the possibility of a second government shutdown in the space of 17 days, passing this sort of legislation -- whether or not it represents a massive U-turn on the very priorities your party touted just a few years ago -- becomes your only option. Which makes Paul either a principled hero or a misguided Don Quixote -- depending on where you stand. \"The reason I'm here tonight is to put people on the spot,\" Paul said. \"I want people to feel uncomfortable.

A Republican official told CNN that President Trump, who is raising money with GOP donors in Beverly Hills, has been asking for updates throughout the evening and is pleasantly surprised by the narrow margin. \"This isn't a blowout \u2014 for now, we'll happily take it,\" one GOP official said. One GOP source, who was worried about a \"bloodbath\" earlier tonight, said Republicans are more hopeful at the moment but still worried. Another source pointed to GOP strength in absentee ballots as a hopeful sign. Earlier in the evening, before it became clear the results would be so close, several Republican officials told CNN they were expecting Saccone to lose. Party officials were placing the blame squarely on Saccone's campaign but also on Trump's Saturday rally, which some Republicans believe helped drive up Democratic turnout. Republicans have spent more than $10 million to prevent a defeat in the district, which Trump won in 2016 by 20 percentage points. Trump remains popular in the district -- 51% of likely voters there approve of his job performance while 47% disapprove, the Monmouth poll out Monday showed.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/13/politics/pennsylvania-special-election-lamb-saccone/index.html", "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Harry Enten", "body": "On Wednesday, Biden said that if he and Trump were in high school, he would \"take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.\"\n\nTrump responded on Thursday, tweeting, \"Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy.

Don't threaten people Joe!\"\n\nThis all feels like a preview of a Biden and Trump face-off come 2020. And, in fact, Biden versus Trump is probably the highest probability matchup compared to all the others at this moment in time, though it's still a relative long-shot.\n\nNow, a word of caution: Early polls are early polls and who knows who might enter the presidential race. It's hard enough for polls to forecast a winner within a week of an election. It's entirely unreasonable to believe they can forecast a winner at this point.\n\n3 big things revealed by Donald Trump's tweet that he could knock out Joe Biden What the polls are good for is telling you who comes to Democratic voters' minds when thinking about who they believe is the leader or next leader of the party. And right now, that person is Biden. In an average of national polls taken this year, he's polling at 27% among a field of potential Democratic contenders in 2020. The only person close to him is Sen. Bernie Sanders who is at 21%. Sanders is earning far below the 43% he won in the 2016 primary . Biden, meanwhile, is earning far higher than 0.2% he took in 2008 . No one else comes close to either candidate. Biden even leads in New Hampshire, which is right next to Sanders' home state of Vermont and where he crushed Clinton in the 2016 primary. A February University of New Hampshire survey put Biden at 35% to Sanders at 24%. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, from next-door Massachusetts, was the only other candidate polling in the double-digits. Biden, who has been running for president going back 30 years, is in the best position he has ever been at this point to claim the Democratic nomination for president. Before this go-round, very few Democrats thought of Biden as the leader at this point in the nascent primary campaign. Before Biden ran for president in the 1988 campaign, he started off in a deep hole. Less than 1% of Democrats selected him as their choice to be the Democratic nominee in a February 1986 ABC News/Washington Post poll for the 1988 Democratic nomination. This was good for dead last. Eventually, Biden's campaign would go down amid a plagiarism scandal There were also talks of a Biden campaign in 2004 . Again, few Democrats thought of Biden as the obvious next choice. He sat in ninth place at a little over 2% in an average of 2004 primary polls taken between January and March of 2002. Biden didn't end up running. Biden actually did pull the trigger on a 2008 campaign. He shot up to an average 4% in the early primary polls (January to March 2006) that cycle. Still, he was in a distant fifth place and would drop out after a poor showing at the Iowa Caucus. It was after this campaign that Biden arguably caught the break of a political lifetime. He became Barack Obama's running-mate and was elected to be vice-president. You would think that this would have made him the top choice for Democrats in 2016. But, Biden ran into the electoral bulldozer Hillary Clinton. The former secretary of state was polling in the 60s and 70s in early primary polls, the highest percentage ever for a non-incumbent. Biden's 12% did place him second, but clearly he wasn't the leader of the party. Biden would end up announcing in late 2015 that he was taking a pass on 2016. Now though, there is no Clinton for Biden to contend with. He is, after more than 30 years, the leader of the Democratic field. Biden has a straight shot at the Republican president. He's going around campaigning like he will run for president, and there's no real reason to doubt it's a strong possibility. With these facts in mind, my guess is that the tat we're seeing between Biden and Trump today is just the first of many to come.", "link": null, "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Pamela Brown", "body": "The move may be delayed because say there's no final decision on a replacement, sources say.

Sources with knowledge of McMaster's standing in the White House have repeatedly said that he has been on thin ice for months. There was discussion in the West Wing about replacing him last fall, but he ultimately survived because officials, including the President himself, were skeptical about the optics of appointing a third national security adviser in less than a year, several sources told CNN. Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned within a month of taking the job amid controversy over his contact with Russian officials.

The State Department declined to comment on the record, but a senior State official who shared the guidance email with CNN said it instructed them to \"freeze further amplification of content that features (Secretary Tillerson)\" until Tillerson himself delivered remarks later in the day.\n\nThe full guidance seen by CNN \"asked all Department bureaus and posts to freeze further amplification of content or messaging which features S (Tillerson) -- this includes both the native posting and/or retweeting/sharing of statements, photos, media notes, videos, or other digital content.\" That senior State Department official told CNN that the message was \"a request from a deputy assistant secretary to hold off, until the secretary had done his briefing.\" But the tone and content of that guidance didn't sit well with many employees, as Goldstein's recounting of Tillerson's firing was already being quoted and retweeted and was not being disputed by the State Department.

Republicans have spent more than $10 million to prevent a defeat in the district, which Trump won in 2016 by 20 percentage points.\n\nIf Lamb wins, or even comes close, it will be a signal that Republicans are in danger even in districts where Trump was won handily in 2016, and raise Democratic hopes of capturing the House and Senate this fall. The race would also serve as a model for Democrats running in deep-red districts across the country.\n\n\"The world is watching,\" Trump said in an appearance in the district Saturday night, upping the pressure for Saccone to deliver on Tuesday.\n\nTrump touts GOP candidate \u2014 and talks drug dealers, 2020 and Oprah in whirlwind rally The race is all about the psychological fallout. Republicans have suffered major losses during Trump's presidency, including a blowout in the Virginia gubernatorial race and a loss in Alabama's Senate race. But those races were more easily explained. The GOP already knows the suburban areas where they were walloped in Virginia are at risk, and in Alabama, Roy Moore faced credible accusations of child molestation. A series of 39 red-to-blue flips in state legislative races got less national attention, though they continued to show an enthusiastic Democratic base. And the party had managed to hold on in House races, including one in the Atlanta suburbs last spring. It's a white, blue-collar region that has overwhelmingly backed Republicans in recent presidential elections. And, unlike last year's contests, Republicans now can tout the tax bill that they had hoped would be a persuasive selling point in key races. Particularly worrying for Republicans is that Lamb has managed to parry the attacks they've hoped will work across the map. He aired a television ad noting that he opposes House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who is deeply unpopular with conservative voters. Lamb has run to the right of most Democrats on a series of issues. He's said he personally opposes abortion. His first campaign ad featured him shooting a semiautomatic rifle, and he's opposed new gun control measures in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, shootings. He's also supported Trump's steel tariffs, muting what the President hoped would be a major selling point for Saccone. National Republicans have done everything possible to save the district. Trump visited twice, including a rally Saturday night where he spoke for 75 minutes and whipped supporters up to back Saccone. \"This guy should win easily,\" Trump said, pointing to the size of his own victory there. 'The Steel Curtain is gone': Trump's trade moves may be of no help in Pennsylvania special election Vice President Mike Pence, Donald Trump Jr., top White House aide Kellyanne Conway and other senior Republicans visited the district, too. House Republicans poured cash onto the Pittsburgh airways and into get-out-the-vote programs. The National Republican Congressional Committee spent $3.5 million. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan, spent $3.3 million. The Republican National Committee chipped in $1.1 million and ran a massive field program, while the Trump-aligned super PAC America First Action spent $1 million. Democrats, meanwhile, spent relatively little: Patriot Majority PAC spent $450,000 and Vote Vets spent $344,000. Several other groups spent smaller amounts, largely on digital advertising. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent $260,000 on television advertising. The lower Democratic spending was in part because the party is gearing up for dozens of races in districts with a recent history of voting more Democratic in presidential races this fall -- and in part because they didn't need to spend money to back Lamb. He outraised Saccone by a nearly five-to-one margin, hauling in $3 million by the most recent campaign finance reports filed February 21. Fearful of a loss, Republicans are downplaying expectations and trashing Saccone as a candidate. The GOP's attempt to downplay the race's importance appears to center on two key factors: Saccone's weak candidacy, explained through his paltry fundraising, and the district's Democratic voter registration advantage, even though that edge isn't reflected in its recent presidential or congressional voting history. Trump has closely followed the race for weeks and received multiple briefings on it last week, a senior White House official said. The official said Trump views Saccone as a weak candidate and is aware that he's struggled to raise money -- but that Trump went into his rally Saturday hoping to move the needle for Saccone with his base of blue-collar supporters, particularly in the wake of his steel tariff announcement. When Trump stood on stage with Saccone in Moon Township on Saturday, he made clear the pressure for a GOP win Tuesday. \"I hate to put this pressure on you, Rick,\" Trump said. \"They're all watching because I won this district, like, by 22 points. It's a lot. That's why I'm here.

But that's not the point.\n\nThe point is this : The indictments of a baker's dozen of Russians gives us a very clear window into not only the depth and breadth of the Mueller investigation, but also makes crystal clear what the Russians wanted in the 2016 election and the elaborate measures they undertook to make it happen.\n\n\"Defendant ORGANIZATION had a strategic goal to sow discord in the U.S. political system, including the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Defendants posted derogatory information about a number of candidates, and by early to mid-2016, Defendants' operations included supporting the presidential campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump (\"Trump Campaign\") and disparaging Hillary Clinton. Defendants made various expenditures to carry out those activities, including buying political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities. Defendants also staged political rallies inside the United States, and while posing as U.S. grassroots entities and U.S. persons, and without revealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation, solicited and compensated real U.S. persons to promote or disparage candidates. Some Defendants, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities.\"\n\nOK. So what we know from that paragraph of the charging documents, which you can read in full here , is this: By \"early to mid-2016,\" Russians had decided to use whatever means at their disposal to help Donald Trump win. The Russians bought political ads on social media sites and organized political rallies to achieve those goals. Russians, disguising their identities, \"communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump campaign\" in an attempt to \"coordinate political activities.\" None of that is a smoking gun of collusion. \"Unwitting\" members of Trumpworld working with Russians, who didn't identify themselves as Russians, is not the same as a willful effort on behalf of members of the Trump campaign to actively collude with the Russian government. But what this latest set of indictments proves beyond a shadow of a doubt is that, yes, Russia staged an aggressive and elaborate effort to influence the 2016 election. This was a multi-pronged campaign -- social media, in-person meetings, political rallies -- by the Russians to beat Hillary Clinton and elect Donald Trump. It employed hundreds of people. That analysis, of course, jibes with the unanimous conclusion of the intelligence community in 2017 that Russia actively sought to influence the 2016 election in support of Trump. What it runs directly counter to is Trump's ongoing -- and persistent -- attempts to cast the entire special counsel investigation as nothing more than a politically motivated sideshow. \"This memo totally vindicates 'Trump' in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead).\" (2/3/18) \"The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues. There was no collusion, everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion, & yet on and on it goes. Russia & the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. Republicans should finally take control!\" (1/10/18) \"The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?\" (5/8/17) There's lots (and lots) more tweets and quotes just like that from the President. Trump has suggested the attempted election hacking could have been perpetrated by China or even as a \"guy sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds.\" You get the idea. Despite the unanimous conclusion of the intelligence community -- including Trump's CIA Director Mike Pompeo and his FBI Director Christopher Wray -- that Russia engaged in a coordinated effort to meddle in the 2017 election, Trump still wasn't convinced. Of course, this changes nothing when it comes to how Trump will respond. Even Friday afternoon, Trump tweeted about the Russian indictments , once again beating the \"no collusion\" drum. \"Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President,\" Trump tweeted. \"The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!\" But if it was very hard to hold the Trumpian position -- it might have been Russia, it might have been someone else! -- with a shred of intellectual honesty prior to Friday, it's impossible now. Consider what the Mueller investigation has already done: Former national security adviser Michael Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians during the 2016 campaign and is cooperating with the Mueller investigation. Former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians during the 2016 campaign and is cooperating with the Mueller investigation. Former deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates is reportedly on the verge of signing a plea agreement and cooperating with Mueller. Gates faces a variety of charges, including money laundering and other financial crimes. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort faces a variety of charges of financial crimes 13 Russians have been indicted on participating in a broad-scale attempt to throw the election to Trump. That is not the stuff of witch hunts and hoaxes. Those are real-life charges which carry at least the possibility of real jail time.

Pat Toomey for being \"afraid of the NRA\" due to the fact that his bipartisan gun control proposal didn't include a provision to raise the the age to certain types of guns from 18 to 21.\n\nOn Sunday night, Trump unveiled his proposal on guns in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, shooting that left 17 people dead. Guess what was left out of that proposal? Yup -- nothing on raising the age limit on the purchase of some types of weapons.\n\n\"Very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by White House. Legislation moving forward. Bump Stocks will soon be out. Highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry, subject to State Law. Armed guards OK, deterrent!

Things are moving rapidly on this, but not much political support (to put it mildly).\"\n\nSo, the reason he didn't push to include raising the age to buy certain kinds of weapons was because he is \"watching court cases and rulings before acting\"? Or is it, as Trump goes on to note, that there is \"not much political support\" for raising the age?\n\nOn the first reason: There are suits being filed against Dick's and Walmart -- which both raised the age to buy rifles to 21 in the wake of the Parkland murders. And the NRA has sued Florida to block the part of its new law that raises the gun-buying age to 21. The NRA says that violates the 2nd and 14th Amendments.\n\nBut those suits are not necessarily a deterrent for the White House throwing its weight behind a proposal to raise the gun-buying age if it so chose. It's a bit of a smokescreen to say that pending legislation ties Trump's hands in any way. If Trump wanted to push on raising the age to buy guns, he could. The litigation is, at best, a secondary concern.\n\nWhich brings me to Trump's second point: That raising the age limit lacks public support. This is not, um, true.\n\nIn a CNN/SSRS poll conducted late last month, 71% said they supported raising the age limit to 21 to buy any sort of gun -- a proposal that goes beyond even what Trump was advocating for in the open meeting he held with members of Congress on guns earlier this month. That support is strongest among Democrats (86%) but more than six in 10 independents (67%) and Republicans (61%) also favor prohibiting gun sales to anyone under 21.\n\nWhen Trump says that raising the age limit to buy a gun lacks political support, what he is really saying is that it lacks the NRA's support -- and those within his base who view any sort of infringement on 2nd Amendment rights as beginning down a slippery slope to gun seizure.\n\nAs soon as Trump floated raising the gun-buying age, the NRA quickly came out in opposition.\n\nAnd now, this. A proposal that focuses heavily on \"hardening\" schools and arming teachers. And totally leaves out raising the age limit to buy certain firearms.\n\nThat omission is not because of pending lawsuits regarding raising the age limit. And it's definitely not because public support -- including among Republicans! -- isn't there for such a proposal.\n\nIt's because the NRA didn't want it in there. And Trump is always putting his base -- of which the NRA and single-issue 2nd Amendment voters are a big part -- first.\n\n\"I'm a fan of the NRA,\" Trump said 11 days ago. \"I mean, there's no bigger fan. I'm a big fan of the NRA.\"\n\nHe just proved it.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/12/politics/trump-guns-nra-analysis/index.html", "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Oren Liebermann", "body": "Jerusalem (CNN) Israeli police said Tuesday there is \"sufficient evidence\" to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on criminal charges in two corruption cases.\n\nAccording to a police statement published late Tuesday, authorities found evidence of \"accepting bribes, fraud, and breach of trust.\"\n\nIn a televised statement, Netanyahu said that the allegations against him would be dismissed, repeating what has become his catchphrase, \"There will be nothing because there is nothing.\"\n\nIn a statement given moments before police issued their official findings, he said: \"I think about the good of the country not for personal reasons of the press, but only for the country, and nothing will stop me from doing this, not even the attacks against me, and believe me they're never ending.\n\n\"And, therefore, today isn't different from any other days which I've been through in past 20 years.\"\n\nWhen asked whether the US had any reaction to the police statement, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said, \"The only thing I have to say about that is that the United States has a very strong relationship, not only with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but also the Israeli government. We're certainly aware of it, but we consider it to be an internal Israeli matter.\"\n\nIn Case 1000, Netanyahu is suspected of having received gifts from businessmen overseas totaling 1 million shekels (approximately $280,000), including cigars, champagne, jewelry and more, from 2007 through 2016.\n\nThe case has focused primarily on Netanyahu's relationship with Israeli billionaire and Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan.\n\nIn exchange for the gifts, police say, Netanyahu tried to advance a tax break that would have benefited Milchan, though he was blocked by the Finance Ministry.\n\n\"According to suspicions, the Prime Minister worked to advance the extension of the tax waiver for returning citizens over 10 years, a benefit that has a considerable economic value for Mr. Milchan,\" the police statement said.\n\nMK Yair Lapid, one of Netanyahu's chief rivals who served as finance minister during this period and was called to testify during the investigation, called on Netanyahu to step down. \"Even if the law does not require the Prime Minister to resign, someone who has such serious accusations against them, many of which he does not deny, cannot continue to serve as Prime Minister with responsibility for the security and well-being of Israel's citizens,\" Lapid said.\n\nPolice say they have enough evidence to indict Milchan on charges of bribery.\n\nMilchan fired back at police, insisting he and Netanyahu have been friends since long before the period under investigation.\n\n\"The recommendation disregards indisputable basic facts including -- the ties between Mr. Milchan and Mr. Netanyahu started in the early years of 2000, when Netanyahu had no government role. This connection was characterized by friendship between the two and their families. In this framework, gifts were given from time to time by Mr. Milchan to the Netanyahu family with no business interest,\" said Milchan's lawyer.\n\nIn Case 2000, police say Netanyahu discussed \"bartering\" with Arnon \"Noni\" Mozes, the owner of one of Israel's leading newspapers, Yedioth Ahronoth, which is regularly critical of the Prime Minister.\n\nIn exchange for more favorable coverage, Netanyahu promised to hamper the circulation of a rival newspaper, in recordings obtained by police.\n\n\"In his framework, what was discussed was the assistance of Mr. Mozes to Netanyahu in establishing his stature as Prime Minister through positive coverage in Yedioth Ahronoth that, in return for the Prime Minister assisting Mr. Mozes in advancing economic interests of Yedioth Ahronoth by an initiative to block the strengthening of Israel Hayom,\" the police statement said.\n\nBoth Netanyahu and Mozes have said these were not serious discussions; rather, they each claim they were trying to expose the other's lack of trustworthiness. Police say there is enough evidence to indict Mozes on charges of offering bribes.\n\nIn a statement to Israeli media, the lawyer for Mozes said, \"The cases against him will be closed.\"\n\nNetanyahu has repeatedly proclaimed his innocence, insisting that investigators will find he did nothing wrong.\n\nPolice will now pass the evidence to the attorney general, who will make a decision on whether or not to indict the Prime Minister. That decision is not expected imminently.\n\nBy Israeli law, he is only required to step down if he is convicted and that conviction is upheld through the appeals process to the High Court, a process that could take years.\n\nHowever, he could face public and political pressure to step down much earlier.\n\nHis coalition partners, so far, have backed him, saying they will not take down the government over a police conclusion.\n\nEarlier this week, Education Minister and head of the right-wing Jewish Home party, Naftali Bennett, said, \"I wish from the depths of my heart that the PM will come out clean and will continue leading the State of Israel. An indictment sheet seems far away, and certainly one does not go for elections over [police] recommendations.\"\n\nEchoing his position, Finance Minister and head of the center-right Kulanu party Moshe Kahlon said, \"Let the [police] recommendations be published. We will not avoid a decision, but I'm telling you right now, by law, the law says until the stage of the attorney general, there is no need to deal with it at all.\"\n\nBoth parties have enough seats in Netanyahu's 66-seat coalition to take down the government and force new elections.\n\nIn an effort to deflect blame, Netanyahu has lashed out, attacking the police, the media, the opposition and the left in rallies and on social media. He has often called the investigations against him \"fake news,\" echoing the language of President Donald Trump.\n\nLast week, Israeli Police Chief Roni Alsheich, in an interview with Israel's Keshet news channel, said \"powerful elements\" were \"sniffing\" around investigators working on the Netanyahu cases.\n\nFiring back, Netanyahu said he was \"shocked by the insinuations\" that he had sent private detectives to tail police, arguing that it casts doubt over the impartiality of the investigations.\n\nIn a strike against the police chief after the interview, Likud MK Yoav Kisch, a hardline supporter of Netanyahu from within the Prime Minister's party, summoned Alsheich to a meeting of the Interior Committee at the Knesset for Wednesday morning.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/13/middleeast/israel-police-netanyahu/index.html", "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Maegan Vazquez", "body": "President Donald Trump says a military parade in Washington could take place on Veterans Day or the Fourth of July, adding that it would be \"something great for the spirit of the country.\"\n\n\"The generals would love to do it, I tell you, and so would I,\" Trump told Fox News' Jeanine Pirro on Saturday night, pitching it as \"a great representative parade.

The State Department official said that, \"given the long timeframes generally associated with major defense deals, the results of this effort are only beginning to become apparent.\" The Treasury Department was expected to release Monday the list of companies and individuals doing business with the Russian entities, along with two reports, all of them mandated by law. One report is expected to list wealthy Russian oligarchs with close ties to Putin, and a second is expected to outline the impact of imposing sanctions on Russia's sovereign debt. In an unclassified letter to the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Tillerson wrote that he had instructed \"all diplomatic posts\" to reach out to their host nations and make \"clear that we intended to robustly implement the law, that transactions determined to be significant were sanctionable, and that we would re-engage where necessary with more specific outreach.\" CAATSA was one of the first pieces of major legislation that Congress sent to President Donald Trump, who has refused to acknowledge fully Russia's interference and has cast doubt on the consensus opinion of US intelligence agencies that Moscow interfered in the 2016 elections. CAATSA passed with broad bipartisan support, clearing the Senate by a vote of 98-2, though Trump signed it into law reluctantly, declaring it \"seriously flawed.\" Among other things, the law limits the President's ability to remove sanctions on Russia without lawmakers' approval. It set two deadlines.

Trump's lawyer John Dowd, meanwhile, issued a prayer Saturday that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would \"bring an end\" to the Mueller probe.\n\nRepublicans have warned there would be severe consequences if Trump moved to fire Mueller following his latest tweets.

Jeff Flake of Arizona, a vocal Trump critic, told reporters was disappointed by silence from McConnell over Trump's attacks on Mueller.

Trump has eyed Energy Secretary Rick Perry as a possible replacement, a person familiar with the matter said, though it's far from clear whether Perry is interested in moving.\n\nThe White House declined to comment Wednesday on reports of an impending administration shake-up, saying only that when Trump decides to make changes he will announce them at the time.\n\n\"There's a lot of speculation.

Trump has made known across the Cabinet that he has no tolerance for ethics scandals, and the White House held private meetings with four Cabinet-level officials -- including Carson, Shulkin, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt -- last month to scold them for embarrassing stories about questionable ethical behavior at their respective agencies, sources familiar with the sessions tell CNN.\n\nInternal watchdogs have launched at least nine audits, reviews or investigations across several Cabinet agencies, and stories about first-class travel, expensive office furniture and internal strife have become commonplace.\n\nPeople inside the West Wing believe Trump is ready to clean house. Despite attempts to bring the Cabinet onto the same page -- including convening near-monthly Cabinet meetings -- Trump now views his Cabinet as burdensome and more likely to produce bad headlines than good ones.\n\nTrump has aired some of his frustrations in public, including lambasting \"beleaguered\" Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom he's never forgiven for recusing himself from Russia-related matters at the Justice Department. Before firing Tillerson, Trump voiced his differences with his top diplomat on Twitter.\n\nHe hasn't openly criticized the secretaries currently embattled in ethics or other scandals, but he is fed up, people who have discussed the matter with him say.

Gates may also even be asked to go undercover.\n\nGates, 45, was Manafort's right-hand man for a decade, was privy to most, if not all, of Manafort's activities during the campaign and stayed in the Trump orbit after Manafort's exit.\n\nManafort has vowed to fight his charges and could be central to Mueller's investigation of the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, given his connection to both Trump and rich and powerful Russia-sympathetic Ukrainians. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\n\"I continue to maintain my innocence,\" Manafort said in a statement Friday after Gates' plea deal. \"I had hoped and expected my business colleague would have had the strength to continue the battle to prove our innocence. For reasons yet to surface he chose to do otherwise. This does not alter my commitment to defend myself against the untrue piled up charges contained in the indictments against me.\"\n\nLast Friday, the special counsel produced grand jury indictments for 13 Russian nationals, accusing them of operating a misinformation campaign to hurt Hillary Clinton's presidential effort. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos have already pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about their interactions with Russians and agreed to cooperate.\n\nIn court and case filings, prosecutors described an 11-year \"scheme\" in which the two longtime business partners allegedly worked together to launder tens of millions of dollars they made doing foreign lobbying work, avoid paying taxes and buoy income with fraudulently obtained loans.\n\nGates said he was guilty of helping Manafort use bank accounts in Cyprus and Grenadines to hide millions of dollars they made lobbying for Ukrainian politicians as far back as 2006.\n\nThe pair flowed $75 million through offshore accounts, and Manafort laundered $18 million to buy property and luxury goods in the US, prosecutors said. Gates transferred $3 million between accounts, court papers said.\n\nManafort also used the bank accounts to buy real estate in the US and obtain mortgages, prosecutors charge.\n\nThroughout the 45-minute plea hearing Friday in Washington, prosecutors framed Gates as an assistant in criminal activity, doing Manafort's bidding.\n\n\"Acting on the authority of Mr. Manafort, [Gates] routinely dealt with Mr. Manafort's tax accountants\" and misled them, prosecutor Greg Andres described to the judge. Manafort also lied on his foreign lobbying registrations \"with Gates' assistance,\" prosecutor Andrew Weissmann said.\n\nGates, bearded and wearing a blue suit, tie and cuff links, listened as Judge Amy Berman Jackson read the offenses he is agreeing to plead guilty to. He said, \"Yes, your honor,\" repeatedly as she read the court documents.\n\nAs he exited the hearing, Gates appeared in a lighter mood. He briefly joked with reporters about whether he may shave his beard, then walked from the courthouse to a waiting SUV through a scrum of cameras and protesters.\n\nGates has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, and they may ask the judge to reduce his sentence if they are satisfied. Gates' attorney also told the court he may argue for a reduction of the sentence because of the \"disproportionate conduct\" between Manafort and Gates.\n\nGates faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, but it's more likely his sentence will range from almost five to six years, the judge said. His charges together also carry a maximum fine of $500,000, though it's more likely his fine will range from $2,000 to $200,000, according to the judge. A hearing date for Gates' sentencing has not been set.\n\nEarlier Friday, Gates said that despite his \"initial desire to vigorously defend myself,\" he has had a \"change of heart\" in order to protect his family, according to a letter sent to his family and friends, obtained by CNN from a Gates friend.\n\n\"The reality of how long this legal process will likely take, the cost, and the circus-like atmosphere of an anticipated trial are too much,\" Gates wrote. \"I will better serve my family moving forward by exiting this process.\"\n\nThe father of four wrote that it was a \"difficult decision\" to make, but that ensuring his family's well-being \"is first and foremost.\"\n\n\"The consequence is the public humiliation, which at this moment seems like a small price to pay for what our children would have to endure otherwise,\" he said.\n\nDocument says Gates lied this month about Ukraine discussion\n\nOne new charge Friday zeroed in on a conversation Gates had with investigators earlier this month about Manafort's Ukrainian lobbying.\n\nGates lied to investigators earlier this month about a 2013 meeting in Washington attended by Manafort and others. According to the document, Gates lied when he said Ukraine was not discussed at the meeting.\n\n\"Gates had participated with Manafort in preparing a report that memorialized for Ukraine leadership the pertinent Ukraine discussions that Manafort represented had taken place at the meeting,\" the new court filing says.\n\nThat meeting, in mid-March 2013, was attended by Manafort, California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher and former Rep. Vin Weber, who is now a lobbyist with Mercury LLC, according to lobbying disclosures filed last year with the Justice Department. Rohrabacher and Weber were not identified in Friday's court filings, though their positions were referenced and the description in the court filing matches the record of the meeting in the lobbying disclosures.\n\nRohrabacher is one of the most Russia-friendly lawmakers on Capitol Hill. He regularly embraces Kremlin-aligned talking points and has forged friendly relations with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Rohrabacher has given private interviews to the Senate and House Intelligence committees, which are conducting their own investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nRohrabacher spokesman Ken Grubbs acknowledged that the congressman attended the meeting with Manafort and Weber.\n\n\"The three reminisced and talked mostly about politics,\" Grubbs said in a statement about the 2013 meeting. \"The subject of Ukraine came up in passing. It is no secret that Manafort represented Viktor Yanukovych's interests, but as chairman of the relevant European subcommittee, the congressman has listened to all points of view on Ukraine.\"\n\nGrubbs also told CNN that Mueller's office has not had any contact with Rohrabacher.\n\nMercury said it had acted appropriately and was cooperating with Mueller.\n\n\"Rick Gates' pleaded guilty to making false statements today. He admitted that he didn't tell the truth to the Government and didn't tell the truth to our lawyers when he spoke to them about this project,\" Mercury said in a statement. \"While he and others involved with this matter may have acted criminally and tried to hide it, we have acted appropriately, following our counsel's advice from the start.\"\n\nProsecutors allege that Manafort's lobbying in the US on behalf of Ukraine went even further in 2013. He allegedly orchestrated a group of former European politicians, called the \"Hapsburg group,\" to act as independent voices, then paid them to push positions favorable to Ukraine.\n\nManafort used offshore accounts to pay the former politicians 2 million euros, a new indictment against Manafort said Friday. They lobbied members of Congress and members of the executive branch in the US around 2013.\n\nManafort also allegedly used $4 million from an offshore account to fund a report on the trial of a political opponent jailed by his clients.

Since then, he has been talking to Mueller's investigators and providing information to the grand jury.\n\nNader attended a December 2016 meeting in New York between Emirati officials and members of Trump's inner circle, and another in January 2017 in the Seychelles islands between the Emiratis and Erik Prince, a Trump associate. Nader was also in the Seychelles when Prince met with a Russian banker, the sources said.\n\nThe special counsel's questions about the Emiratis point to an investigation that has expanded beyond Russian meddling in the 2016 election to broader concerns about foreign influence during the presidential campaign and long after it concluded. The Washington Post reported last week that at least four countries, including the United Arab Emirates, have discussed ways they could compromise Jared Kushner, the President's son-in-law.\n\nWhile there is no indication that Nader is suspected of wrongdoing, his knowledge of key meetings involving the Emiratis and others could be helpful to the special counsel in understanding the inner workings of the transition and possible efforts to influence key figures in the administration.\n\nNader learned for the first time when he returned to Dulles that the special counsel was interested in him and the information he had about key sessions, at least two of which he personally attended.\n\nThe FBI agents with search warrants imaged his electronic devices and then served him with a grand jury subpoena ordering him to appear January 19, according to a person familiar with Nader's involvement. An agreement was reached that Nader appear for questioning with Mueller's investigators.\n\nNader attended a meeting in the Seychelles between the Emiratis and Prince, people familiar with the session told CNN. Nader was also present at the bar when Prince met with Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive of the state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund, although it is unclear whether he was involved in the conversation, these people say.\n\nAfter the election ended, Nader maintained contact with senior administration officials, including Bannon and Kushner, according to sources familiar with the situation.\n\nThe White House, Nader's lawyer and the special counsel's office declined to comment. The Embassy for the United Arab Emirates did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNader, a 58-year-old Lebanese-American, has kept a low profile even among Middle East experts in the US.\n\n\"He is a man of mystery,\" said Frederic Hof, director of the Atlantic Council's Middle East center. \"Until this recent flurry of interest in him, I don't think I've even heard his name mentioned for 12 years.\"\n\nOne Middle East expert was stunned to hear that Nader, who travels frequently, maintained an address in Washington. Another expressed surprise at finding out Nader was still alive because he had disappeared from public view.\n\nSince the 1980s, Nader has made a habit of ingratiating himself with administrations in Washington by volunteering to open lines of communication with elusive Middle Eastern leaders. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Nader was the president and editor of a magazine called Middle East Insight. While many in his field assumed his role as a magazine editor helped him create inroads with prominent leaders abroad, they still had little insight into how he'd built such an unusual rolodex.\n\n\"He had stunningly authentic contacts,\" said Aaron David Miller, the director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Nader had prominent ties in Lebanon, Syria, Israel and Iran and, for the most part, was able to move freely within those countries, according to people who have worked with him.\n\n\"He had tremendous contacts in the Middle East in places that normal people -- at least back then, and to this day -- don't go,\" said Miller, a former adviser to six secretaries of state who encountered Nader frequently over the years.\n\nPeople who worked with him described him as low-key -- a discreet name-dropper who often volunteered his efforts as a go-between and provided credible information.\n\nDennis Ross, a fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, first encountered Nader when he was working on Middle East issues in the waning days of the Reagan administration. But he came to work with him more closely under President George H.W. Bush on an effort to free Americans who were still being held hostage in Lebanon after the Iran-Contra affair, Ross said.\n\nNader acted as a middle man between the US and Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, a Shiite cleric in Lebanon whose work inspired the founders of Hezbollah. Nader relayed Fadlallah's demands to Ross, who insisted the US wasn't going to negotiate. But the two sides kept talking.\n\n\"He was involved in discussions that ultimately led to the release of those who were being held in Lebanon,\" Ross said.\n\nNot all of his endeavors yielded success.\n\nDuring the Clinton administration, Nader was involved in another \"shadow diplomatic effort,\" this time to attempt to strike an Israeli-Syrian peace deal, Ross said. He worked alongside Ronald Lauder, a cosmetics heir who has been heavily involved in Jewish philanthropic causes, on the off-the-books effort. Nader was brought in, at least in part, because he spoke Arabic and had a relationship with Walid Muallem, at the time the Syrian ambassador to the US who went on to become Syria's foreign minister.\n\nBut it was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nFor his work over the years, Nader asked for nothing in return.\n\n\"He was presenting himself to all sides as someone who could be a kind of middleman,\" Ross said. \"I don't know if it meant he got paid by others, but he certainly wasn't paid by any of us.\"\n\nIt's unclear how Nader first came into contact with members of Trump's inner circle.\n\nThe New York meeting was unusual enough that it prompted a scramble inside the White House, where Obama administration officials saw intelligence reports on the meeting and sought to find out who the Emiratis were meeting.\n\nThe New York session occurred in December. After that discussion, Emirati officials helped set up the Seychelles meeting between Dmitriev, the head of the Russian investment fund, and Prince, a prominent Trump donor and founder of the security firm Blackwater.\n\nThe meeting's existence drew the interest of intelligence agencies from the US and the Middle East.\n\nThe meeting with Dmitriev, he said, lasted about a half hour after dinner over a beer.\n\nA spokesman for Prince said his client has no comment beyond his testimony.", "link": null, "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Zachary Cohen", "body": "Washington (CNN) Air Force One is primed to receive an upgrade that will include new refrigerators expected to cost American taxpayers nearly $24 million.\n\nThe US Air Force awarded Boeing a $23.6 million contract in December to replace two of the five \"cold chiller units\" aboard the aircraft used by President Donald Trump.\n\n\"The current rear lower lobe cold chiller units being replaced are the original commercial equipment delivered with the aircraft in 1990.

Some of the intelligence collected includes communications that sparked concerns among investigators that Manafort had encouraged the Russians to help with the campaign, three sources familiar with the investigation have told CNN.

Gowdy's congressional tenure has been marked by central roles in high-profile investigations. The Gowdy-led House Benghazi investigation drew near constant headlines and included a focus on Clinton's email practices as secretary of state. In the fall of 2015, Clinton appeared before the committee for a daylong hearing, and as he released a report on the probe's findings, Gowdy defended the investigation and faulted the Obama administration for lapses that led to the deaths in Benghazi.

Gowdy took himself out of the running, and said in a statement at the time that he had told Attorney General Jeff Sessions he would not be the right choice to take over the bureau. More recently, Gowdy has both criticized the FBI's conduct during the 2016 election and defended former FBI Director Robert Mueller's stewardship of the special counsel investigation into potential coordination between Trump's associates and Russia to influence the 2016 US election.

Jack Reed if he has been directed by the President, through the defense secretary, to confront Russian cyber operators at the source, Rogers said \"no I have not\" but noted that he has tried to work within the authority he maintains as a commander.\n\nWhile he did not agree with Reed's characterization that the US has been \"sitting back and waiting,\" Rogers admitted that it is fair to say that \"we have not opted to engage in some of the same behaviors we are seeing\" with regards to Russia.\n\n\"It has not changed the calculus or the behavior on behalf of the Russians,\" Rogers said about the US response to Russia's cyber threat to date.\n\n\"They have not paid a price that is sufficient to change their behavior,\" he added.\n\nReed, D-Rhode Island, also asked FBI Director Christopher Wray, earlier this month whether the efforts to counter Russia's election activities in 2018 had been directed by Trump. \"Not as specifically directed by the President,\" Wray responded during a hearing at the Senate Intelligence Committee. US intel chiefs unanimous that Russia is targeting 2018 elections On Tuesday, Rogers reiterated that he still views Moscow as a threat to the 2018 elections, a stance that is consistent with what he and other top national security officials told the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this month. \"We expect Russia to continue using propaganda, social media, false-flag personas, sympathetic spokesmen and other means to influence, to try to build on its wide range of operations and exacerbate social and political fissures in the United States,\" Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats previously testified. \"There should be no doubt that Russia perceives its past efforts as successful and views the 2018 US midterm elections as a potential target for Russian influence operations,\" he said. But that conclusion appears at odds with Trump's repeated dismissals of Russian election meddling. Trump declared last week that \"the facts\" prove he's been tougher on Russia than his predecessor, President Barack Obama but it is clear that is not the case -- especially when it comes to punishing Russia for interfering in US elections. Trump says 'the facts' prove he's tougher on Russia than Obama -- they don't Trump has yet to levy a single sanction to punish Russia for election interference, despite the fact that Congress almost unanimously passed legislation that took effect on January 29 requiring him to do so, and despite senior intelligence officials testifying that Russia is trying to disrupt the 2018 midterms. Rogers clearly indicated on Tuesday that the US response to Moscow's interference in the 2016 election has been insufficient and has done little to deter ongoing attacks. The NSA chief went on to tell lawmakers that the US is smart enough and strong enough to prevent Russian election hacking but admitted not enough is being done.

Trump had already been angered by a letter that the Justice Department sent to the House Intelligence Committee last week warning the release would be \"extraordinarily reckless.\" The FBI went ahead and issued the statement Wednesday anyway.\n\nOfficials from the Justice Department and FBI went to the White House on Tuesday to make a renewed effort to explain to the White House certain inaccuracies they see in the Nunes memo, according to a source familiar with the discussions. The effort came a day after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Wray made similar entreaties to White House chief of staff John Kelly to delay a House vote on releasing the memo.\n\nThe memo also faces deep opposition inside the intelligence agencies, multiple current and former intelligence officials tell CNN. The intelligence community's concern is that by revealing details of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant process, crucial elements of intel gathering will be revealed, potentially causing foreign intelligence targets to change behavior to avoid surveillance in the future.\n\nSpecifically, these intelligence officials are concerned that the memo will reveal what goes into a decision to monitor targets, including what kinds of communications are targeted, and how those communications are intercepted.\n\nThese intelligence officials emphasize that applications for FISA warrants would need to be based on law enforcement information as well as intelligence gathered independently by US intelligence agencies. That would include intercepted communications and would not meet the standard for approval if the applications were based largely or entirely on outside information, such as the dossier compiled by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele.\n\nRepublican lawmakers allege that the FISA warrant obtained to monitor former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was based in large part on the dossier, and that the judge who approved the application was not made aware to what degree the dossier played a role in the FBI request.\n\nLikely, whenever Trump sees the document, he won't see it in a vacuum. It will be accompanied by the relevant agencies weighing in on their interests and contextual underlying intelligence, if warranted.\n\nBut the details of how the review is being conducted are still unclear. Wray reviewed the memo over the weekend. Republican members have said that Wray did not raise any objections about inaccuracies at the time.\n\nThat said, the Nunes document, the source familiar with the discussion said, is subject to political considerations more so than a typical document that would be subject to this kind of interagency review.", "link": null, "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Nicole Gaouette", "body": "Washington and New York (CNN) President Donald Trump's decision to bring on John Bolton as national security adviser jolted the usually careful diplomatic world enough that a few unusually frank adjectives slipped out.\n\n\"Worrisome,\" said one South Korean official. Japan's foreign minister admitted he was \"a bit surprised.\"\n\nThe famously hawkish Bolton will become part of a new trio advising and guiding Trump as he navigates unprecedented talks with North Korea, his possible departure from the Iran nuclear deal, and increased tension with Moscow and Beijing.\n\nBolton, a former State Department official and ambassador to the UN, could be joined, pending confirmation, by Gina Haspel, a career CIA officer who has been nominated to lead the agency, and the current CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who has been tapped to lead the State Department\n\nHaspel remains something of a cipher to the public, but Pompeo's tenure as a lawmaker established him as a hardliner who advocated for bombing Iran even as negotiations on the international nuclear deal were ongoing.\n\nThe world reacted with caution and some dismay.\n\nIn one quarter, there was warm praise.\n\nBut at the UN, the place where Bolton is perhaps best known because of his tenure as ambassador from 2005 to 2006, officials chose their words with extremely diplomatic care, with some issuing veiled warnings about the need to defend the institution and its cooperative, collaborative ideals.\n\nRichard Gowan, a UN analyst at Columbia University, had an explanation. \"The UN is in considerable trouble,\" Gowan said. \"Bolton does not merely dislike the UN. He knows the organization rather too well for comfort.\"\n\n\"A club for people to get together\"\n\nWith Trump already pre-disposed to dislike the UN -- he referred to it as \"just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time\" -- Gowan said Bolton could deepen cuts the Trump administration has already made to its regular budget and peacekeeping operations and perhaps go even further.\n\n\"He will likely press [US Ambassador to the UN Nikki] Haley and Pompeo to find ways to weaken the UN quite drastically and decisively,\" Gowan said, \"rather than merely trimming its budgets.\"\n\nA UN Security Council diplomat hedged on Pompeo's impact at the State Department, but added, \"an appointment of John Bolton ... that would change the question.\"\n\nUN diplomats were more careful on the record. Spokesman Stephane Dujarric, who defended the institution against some of Bolton's broadsides in 2006, said Friday that UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres \"had developed a very constructive and positive relationship\" with outgoing national security adviser H.R. McMaster. \"and he looks forward to continuing that relationship with Ambassador Bolton.\"\n\nReporters asked Dujarric to respond to some of Bolton's more pointed criticisms of the UN. The lawyer and Fox News commentator has said there's \"no such thing\" as the United Nations, that if the headquarters lost 10 stories, it wouldn't make a difference, and that it would be a mistake to grant validity to international law.\n\n\"Look, we will leave analysis of past statements to journalists and historians,\" Dujarric said. \"We're not going to speculate about the future, we're dealing with the present. And as I said, the secretary general looks forward to continuing the kind of relationship he had with the national security adviser with the new one.\"\n\nWhen asked about Bolton's appointment, Sigrid Kaag, the Netherlands' minister of foreign trade, told reporters that, \"we remained firmly anchored in multilateralism as a way to solve most burning and pertinent issues today, in the past, and in the future.\"\n\nUK Deputy Ambassador to the UN Jonathan Allen was asked if Bolton's appointment was going to test multilateralism, given his hostile views.\n\n\"The US and the UK have long been close allies and friends,\" Allen said without mentioning Bolton's name. \"That will continue and endure.\"\n\n\"This is worrisome news,\" Kim Hack-yong, a conservative South Korean lawmaker who heads his parliament's national defense committee, told Reuters.\n\nBolton's views on Pyongyang were most recently on display in a February 28 commentary that laid out what he called a \"perfectly legitimate\" case for a pre-emptive strike against North Korea. It used an example from 1837 as the basis for his justification and made no mention of the thousands of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Koreans who would die in the event of a US military attack and North Korean reprisal.\n\nKim was among many observers who worried about the repercussions if planned May talks between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un don't go well.\n\nJapanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said he was \"a bit surprised\" that former national security adviser H.R. McMaster was out, given that he'd just met him the week before in Washington. That said, Kono told the Japan Times that he didn't expect big changes given the \"complete agreement\" between Washington and Tokyo.\n\nJapan's Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yoshihide Suga, offered the Japan Times a very careful and caveated assessment. \"We have been closely exchanging views with the US government, both between leaders and at the working level, so we don't think there will be any particular negative influence.\"\n\nThere was no reaction from North Korea, which in 2003 felt free to blast Bolton as \"human scum\" and a \"bloodsucker.\"\n\nIn 2006, Bolton was working with the Security Council on North Korea resolutions after illegal missile and nuclear tests. At one meeting the North Korea representative walked out on the Council, which Bolton compared to former Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev pounding his shoe on a desk in the General Assembly when upset.\n\nMiddle Eastern reaction was clearly divided. Across the region, countries are waiting to see whether Trump will walk away from the nuclear deal with Iran on May 12, the day he has to continue to waive sanctions on Tehran or pull the IS out of the agreement. Trump has set that day as a deadline for US and European negotiators to find a way to change the deal.\n\nIn Iran, the spokesman of the powerful Guardian Council pointed to Bolton's ties with a group that opposes the government in Tehran, and said it showed Washington's continued support for terrorist groups operating against Iran. \"Now the question is why Bolton has been assumed to a sensitive position,\" he wrote in a piece for the semi-official Fars News service.\n\nThe Lebanese newspaper al-Akhbar, aligned with the Shi'ite militant group and political movement Hezbollah, used the headline \"Zionist Hawk in the White House,\" to alert readers to Bolton's new job, Reuters reported.\n\nBut in Israel, Bolton's ascension was greeted as happy news. Naftali Bennett, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet, hailed Bolton as \"an extraordinary security expert, experienced diplomat and a stalwart friend of Israel.\"", "link": null, "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Chris Cillizza", "body": "(CNN) President Donald Trump wasn't -- and, apparently, still isn't -- happy that Democrats in Congress didn't stand to applaud him in his State of the Union address last week.\n\n\"They were like death and un-American.

Trump has nursed a grudge against Sessions ever since the former Alabama senator decided to recuse himself from all Justice Department investigations into the 2016 campaign, including the ongoing Russia probe. Last year he slammed Sessions on Twitter for taking \"a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers\" and described his as \" beleaguered \" in a tweet that asked why he wasn't \"looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?\" Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2017 Even still, Sessions has remained in the administration despite regularly drawing Trump's ire. It was clear to people Trump was speaking with over the weekend and sources with knowledge of his feelings, though, that his disdain for Sessions hasn't gone away. One person said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's televised announcement Friday of indictments against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities for allegedly meddling in the 2016 presidential election reignited Trump's anger at Sessions. \"He will never get over Sessions recusing himself,\" a person familiar with the President's thinking said. The President also has come to believe Sessions is in over his head at the Justice Department, this person says. It's unlikely, though, that Sessions is going anywhere soon, given how any confirmation battle for a new attorney general would be a protracted and deeply partisan fight. Trump and his top aides, in an attempt to protect the President and the White House from a steady stream of stories about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into election meddling, has started to fault the Obama administration for not doing enough when the former president was in control. \"He has been tougher on Russia in the first year than Obama was in eight years combined,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said during Tuesday's White House briefing. While Trump and even some Democrats have criticized the Obama administration for not speaking up enough on Russia's actions before the election, Obama did take some steps to reprimand the country. Obama confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in China in 2016, something Trump has yet to forcefully do in meetings with the Russian leader. Trump and Putin discussed election interference in Hamburg, Germany, in July 2017. Trump later said he thought the Russian leader was earnest when he denied any election meddling. Mnuchin says more Russia sanctions are coming During his last two years in office, Obama also imposed sanctions on Russian individuals and entities for election meddling, kicked out 35 Russian diplomats and closed two Kremlin compounds in the United States. Trump has yet to impose sanctions overwhelmingly passed by Congress last year and missed deadlines to identify which Russian individuals and entities would be on the sanctions list. Last month, the Trump administration decided against implementing the sanctions against Russia and instead published a list of already prominent Russian oligarchs Sanders suggested on Tuesday that more action to confront Russia was soon to be released.", "link": null, "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Dan Merica", "body": "The tweet is the latest in a series where Trump faults former President Barack Obama for not doing enough to stop Russian meddling , but the first time Trump has suggested that Sessions -- the man he picked to lead the Justice Department but has maintained a grudge against for the better part of a year -- wasn't doing enough.\n\n\"Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren't they the subject of the investigation?\" Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. \"Why didn't Obama do something about the meddling?

It was announced at the 2017 meeting of the Clinton Health Matters Activation Summit. The program \"is part of an ongoing collaboration between the Clinton Health Matters Initiative (CHMI) and Adapt Pharma,\" the 2017 release from Adapt Pharma said . \"As of today, all Title IV-eligible, degree-granting colleges and universities in the United States can apply to receive up to four free cartons (eight 4mg doses) of NARCAN\u00ae Nasal Spray.\" Gillian Sealy, CEO of the Clinton Health Matters Initiative, said at the time the fact that the foundation was partnering with \"Adapt Pharma to help put an end to this epidemic is an important step.\" Adapt Pharma announced an \" expansion of its program \" on Monday.

The effort came a day after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Chris Wray made similar entreaties to White House chief of staff John Kelly to delay a House vote on releasing the memo. The memo also faces deep opposition inside the intelligence agencies, multiple current and former intelligence officials tell CNN. The intelligence community's concern is that by revealing details of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant process, crucial elements of intel gathering will be revealed, potentially causing foreign intelligence targets to change behavior to avoid surveillance in the future. Specifically, these intelligence officials are concerned that the memo will reveal what goes into a decision to monitor targets, including what kinds of communications are targeted, and how those communications are intercepted. These intelligence officials emphasize that applications for FISA warrants would need to be based on law enforcement information as well as intelligence gathered independently by US intelligence agencies. That would include intercepted communications and would not meet the standard for approval if the applications were based largely or entirely on outside information, such as the dossier compiled by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele. Wray hints to FBI staff that coming IG report played role in McCabe departure Republican lawmakers allege that the FISA warrant obtained to monitor former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was based in large part on the dossier, and that the judge who approved the application was not made aware to what degree the dossier played a role in the FBI request. Administration officials cautioned that despite President Donald Trump's comment that he will \"100%\" release the memo , the document will be reviewed to make sure that it does not compromise sources and methods. Likely, whenever Trump sees the document, he won't see it in a vacuum. It will be accompanied by the relevant agencies weighing in on their interests and contextual underlying intelligence, if warranted. But the details of how the review is being conducted are still unclear. Wray reviewed the memo over the weekend. Republican members have said that Wray did not raise any objections about inaccuracies at the time. That said, the Nunes document, the source familiar with the discussion said, is subject to political considerations more so than a typical document that would be subject to this kind of interagency review.", "link": "http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/31/politics/nunes-memo-law-enforcement/index.html", "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Ivan Watson", "body": "Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) From behind bars in a sweltering immigration detention center in Bangkok, a self-styled \"sex coach\" who claims to have detailed insider knowledge of Russian meddling in the US election says she wants to cooperate with US investigators.\n\nThe catch?

The scene was chaotic, loud and miserably hot.\n\nVashukevich spoke through bars within touching distance of Kirillov, who stood barefoot with other male prisoners behind a second row of bars.\n\nVashukevich, who claims to be the former mistress of Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, says she witnessed several meetings in 2016 and 2017 between Deripaska and at least three un-named Americans.\n\nDeripaska -- who denies any affair -- is a subject of political intrigue in US political circles, owing to his longstanding relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"They had a plan for the election,\" says Vashukevich of the men.\n\nWhen he was confronted by CNN last year, Deripaska called allegations that he may have been a back channel from the Kremlin to the Trump campaign \"fake news.\"\n\nRegarding his alleged relationship with Vashukevich, a spokesperson for Deripaska told CNN: \"This is clearly an attempt by Anastasia Vashukevitch (aka Nastya Rybka) to politicize the accusations of the Thai police. There have been endless fictitious stories told by her, all serving to distract the public from real violations, including very serious breaches of law of many countries.\"\n\nVashukevich says she has photos of one of the Americans meeting with Deripaska, as well as more than an hour of audio recordings.\n\nBut she refuses to name the Americans.\n\nVashukevich and Kirillov told CNN they are afraid to reveal potentially compromising information, in the event they are deported back to Russia.\n\nThey have made public appeals to the US government to speak to them, but they say so far no US official has visited them in jail.\n\n\"If I was an ambassador and there was information affecting the country I love and I didn't do anything, it would be very silly,\" Vashukevich told CNN.\n\nBack outside the detention center, Pavlo Yunko, a Ukrainian-American tourist who says he paid around $400 to attend Vashukevich and Kirillov's week-long \"sex training\" course, described the predicament now facing the pair as \"a matter of life and death.\"\n\nYunko claims to have been passed a hand-written note from Kirillov shortly after his arrest, which he says he personally delivered to an official at the US Embassy in Bangkok.\n\n\"We ask you political asylim [sic] and help us and protect us as quickly as possible, because we have very important information for USA and we risk our lives very much,\" read the note.\n\n\"We have photo-video-audio of crymes [sic] of Russian government and I give them USA if you help us,\" he added.\n\nJillian Bonnardeaux, a spokesperson for the US Embassy in Bangkok, told CNN on Monday she was aware of media reports of the arrests and the letter seeking asylum, but referred inquiries to Thai law enforcement.\n\n\"We refer all inquiries about asylum and asylum procedures to the DHS,\" Bonnardeaux added, referring to the US Department of Homeland Security.\n\nDeripaska is an ex-business associate of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\nManafort, who provided investment and consulting services to Deripaska, worked for the Russian billionaire about a decade ago, according to both men.\n\nAccording to emails described to The Washington Post, Manafort, through an intermediary, offered to provide Deripaska with \"private briefings\" about the state of the Trump campaign.\n\nSpeaking to CNN, a spokesperson for Deripaska denied allegations that the billionaire received any communications regarding private briefings.\n\nManafort's spokesman told the Post that any briefing offered on the state of the campaign would have been \"routine,\" but that no briefings took place.\n\nWhile on the way to detention in Thailand, Vashukevich published a video on her Instagram account begging US journalists to help her.\n\n\"I'm ready to give you all the missing puzzle pieces, support them with videos and audios, regarding the connections of our respected lawmakers with Trump, Manafort and the rest. I know a lot. I'm waiting for your offers and I'm waiting for you in a Thai prison,\" she said.\n\nOn Monday, speaking inside the detention center, Kirillov repeated this claim, saying he had seen photos of one of the unnamed Americans meeting with Deripaska.\n\nKirillov claims he tried and failed through a friend to contact the FBI while in Dubai in February. He also says he planned to travel to the US to try to meet with US officials after the week-long \"sex training course\" he ran in Pattaya. Those plans were foiled when Thai police burst into the last session of the sex course.\n\nThe claims made by Vashukevich and Kirillov might not normally hold much water.\n\nBoth describe themselves as free sex advocates whose Instagram feeds are full of scantily clad photos of themselves cavorting with other half-naked young women.\n\nBut allegations and revelations of an affair Vashukevich made in her book \"Diary of the Seduction of a Billionaire\" gained traction thanks to an investigation by the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\n\nIn his video, Navalny revealed that the un-named oligarch in the book was Russian industrialist Oleg Deripaska. Navalny highlighted social media posts from Vashukevich showing her next to Deripaska on a yacht alongside the Russian deputy prime minister Sergey Prikhodko.\n\nAsked about Navalny's investigation, Vashukevich told CNN \"it was all correct.\"\n\nIn the Thai jail, Vashukevich and Kirillov looked uncomfortable and desperate. They said conditions were over-crowded and miserable. They relied on food brought in every other day by friends.\n\nThe lawyer representing them says she was surprised at how long it was taking to deport the jailed \"sex coaches.\"\n\n\"Normally my clients are deported in one or two days,\" said Elena Fominykh, a Russian-speaking legal advisor and private investigator based in Bangkok.\n\nThe arrests of the pair are a worrying turn for a group of Russian-speaking acolytes of Kirillov, author of books \"Life Without Panties\" and \"The Game of Master and Huntress.\"\n\nOn Monday, Ukrainian native Maria Skulbeda waited outside the detention center in the sweltering heat in the hopes of arranging an appointment to meet Kirillov and Vashukevich.\n\nThe 21-year-old Skulbeda described Kirillov as a kind of sexual revolutionary, who teaches his followers a belief system of \"freedom, sex and love\" that revolves around the art of seduction.\n\n\"I am an employee, I am a friend, I am a lover,\" said Skulbeda, of her relationship with Kirillov.\n\nDeripaska, she said, was well known within the group to be a target of seduction by Vashukevich.\n\nA spokesperson for Deripaska denied claims he was romantically involved with Vashukevich.\n\nNow, Skulbeda fears what may happen if her friends are deported to Russia.\n\n\"First, they are in danger.

Steve Stivers of Ohio, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told GOP lawmakers gathered for the private caucus meeting. \"If you're getting outraised, this is a wake-up call. Prepare to bear down.\"\n\nHolding onto a narrow lead, Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory in the wee Wednesday morning hours as his special election match-up against Republican Rick Saccone in Pennsylvania's 18th District went down to the wire and the final absentee and provisional ballots were being counted.\n\nFor Republicans, that the race was close at all is alarming: President Donald Trump won the district by 20 percentage points in 2016, and the GOP had pulled out all the stops to prevent an embarrassing loss, including dispatching Trump to campaign there twice and spending heavily on the race.\n\nStivers told Republicans that \"our voters turned out, but you can't get outspent five to one.\"\n\nIt was a jab at Saccone's paltry fundraising: He took in just $615,000, while Lamb raised $3 million.\n\nBut outside Republican groups pumped another $10.7 million into the race -- including about $3.5 million each from the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Ryan. And the GOP still fell short in what had for years been seen as a safe district.\n\nRyan on Wednesday morning was re-emphasizing a message he's delivered GOP lawmakers for months: The tax bill, passed in December, needs to be sold aggressively -- particularly as a boost for working-class families.\n\nRepublicans in competitive races acknowledge Wednesday that Pennsylvania served as a warning.\n\n\"I don't think there's need to be alarmed, but there's certainly reason to be concerned,\" said North Dakota Rep. Kevin Cramer, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp.\n\nOklahoma Rep. Tom Cole said the message from the special election was clear. \"You better be ready and in the end you determine your own fate in these things, particularly when you're running with candidates who have run before and won in difficult circumstances,\" Cole said, noting that the most vulnerable members are the 23 Republicans in seats that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016.\n\nRepublicans also argued that Trump's visit the Saturday before the election helped Saccone make up some ground in the final days of the race.\n\n\"it was probably a little bit too little, too late,\" Illinois GOP Rep. John Shimkus told reporters. He said he thinks the President can help in some districts, but lawmakers will have to make that determination on their own.\n\n\"I think in Pennsylvania the feedback was that Trump actually closed the gap for Saccone by coming in, so there was a feeling that there was going to be a bigger deficit for Saccone than there may have been, but it's probably different district by district,\" said Ohio Rep. Warren Davidson.\n\nSeveral Republicans indicated that Ryan and other leaders gave a clear message that members can't be outraised by challengers and they need to work harder to have a financial advantage in a challenging political climate.\n\n\"Money is something you can make up pretty quickly, particularly if you are an incumbent and it's a competitive seat,\" Cole said.\n\nBut GOP lawmakers criticized their own candidate, Saccone, for not raising enough money and failing to take control of the narrative in the race.\n\n\"You've got to control your own destiny and he didn't,\" Shimkus said.\n\nShimkus pointed to the financial gap in the two campaigns as the reason why Saccone couldn't use the tax bill as an effective issue because he let outside groups and Lamb define who he was.\n\n\"He couldn't do the positive message because he didn't have the money,\" Shimkus said.\n\nLamb said on the campaign trail that he'd oppose House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, for speaker. But that didn't seem to diminish Pelosi's happiness over the outcome in a district where Democrats have been blown out in recent elections.\n\n\"It's exciting.

Un-American. Somebody said, 'Treasonous.' I mean, yeah, I guess, why not,\" Trump said to laughter during a speech outside Cincinnati, Ohio on Monday.

It's disgraceful,\" Trump told reporters, delivering a sudden shock to the global economy by saying he would unveil tariffs next week of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum. He further stoked fears of world turmoil Friday morning, tweeting that \"trade wars are good\" when the US is losing billions in overseas deals.\n\nWhen a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don't trade anymore-we win big. It's easy!\n\nWorld powers now know what it's been like for Trump's fellow Republicans and staff in a week of turmoil and neck-jerking policy pivots that have left them groping for clarity and trying to work out exactly where the President stands.\n\nAt home, stocks crashed on the President's offhanded announcement, while GOP leaders, stung by a second straight day of Trump trampling party orthodoxy after his surreal meeting Wednesday on guns , registered dissent and frustration.\n\n\"We were told at the beginning of all this that Donald Trump was comfortable with chaos -- that's how he is accustomed to operate,\" David Axelrod, a former Obama administration top strategist, said on CNN's \"The Situation Room.\"\n\n\"That may be OK if you are running a small family branding business, but when you are in the most important office on the planet it can have grave consequences,\" Axelrod said.\n\nGiven the on-again-off-again nature of Thursday's announcement and subsequent lack of details, there was more than a suspicion that the trade move had been fast-tracked to distract from a disastrous week.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders denied the President was trying to divert attention from all that with his trade announcement, saying it was hardly news that Trump thinks global commerce, particularly as practiced by nations like China, cheats American workers.\n\n\"The President is concerned about the men and women of this country who have been forgotten about, the industries that our country was founded and built on. And this shouldn't come as a surprise to anybody,\" she said.\n\nEven so, Thursday's move, which is likely to spark follow-on turmoil in Asian and European markets, offered a glimpse of how an erratic President looking for diversions amid deepening crises could act in ways that jolt global stability.\n\nGiven that the turmoil surrounding Trump seems to spin more out of control by the day, the world could be in for a rough ride in the coming months.\n\nStill, while much of the Washington and global establishment will be bracing for more, Trump supporters are unlikely to be fazed, since his unpredictability and disdain for long-held conventions and behavioral codes are exactly why they voted for him as they looked for someone willing to shake things up.\n\nBut anyone who is not in his famously loyal voting base may beg to differ.\n\nThursday was not the first time that Trump's determination to honor his populist, nationalist campaign rhetoric had sent shock waves around the globe. It helped drive his decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord and repeated efforts to sink the Iran nuclear deal brokered by President Barack Obama, both of which caused panic and consternation abroad.\n\nThe drama was also typical of the unpredictable, often unspecific style of leadership that appears often to skirt over the possible consequences of Trump's tendency to trust his instincts.\n\nThere was not much sign, for instance, that the White House had gamed out the reactions of trading partners to the new tariffs and the risk of a trade war and damage to key alliances that they could provoke.\n\nA trade war could well destabilize the global economy and have consequences for the President's political fortunes if US stocks and growth take a hit from reprisals by foreign powers, in sectors other than steel and aluminum.\n\nMolson Coors, for instance, warned that tariffs on aluminum could push up the cost of beer in cans and cause jobs to be lost.\n\n\"There will be retaliation, there will be a response and I think it is extremely unfortunate,\" Carlos Gutierrez, who served as commerce secretary under President George W. Bush, said on CNN International. \"This is most likely going to be a self-inflicted wound that will go on for a while.\"\n\nPlaying several moves ahead has not been one of Trump's strengths as President. Had he done so as he was staffing his administration, he might have concluded it was perhaps unwise to invite his family and their tangled business ties into the West Wing, a decision that has now landed him multiple ethical troubles.\n\nUS allies like Britain and Canada registered alarm at Trump's trade move, balking especially at the White House's rationale that their steel imports threatened US national security.\n\nBut foreign officials, just like those in Washington, struggled to work out exactly what Trump means to do.\n\n\"As a key NORAD and NATO ally, and as the number one customer of American steel, Canada would view any trade restrictions on Canadian steel and aluminum as absolutely unacceptable,\" Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said, promising retaliation if Trump goes ahead.\n\nBritain was mostly puzzled: CNN's Jim Acosta reported that a UK government spokesman said, \"We are engaging with the US on what this announcement means in practice.\"\n\nThose reactions mirrored the indignation and mystification painted on the faces of GOP senators who sat through the President's freewheeling, contradictory session on gun reform at the White House on Wednesday.\n\nThe lack of detail and planning seems endemic to a presidency that revolves around impulsive tweets and off-the-cuff comments by a President who has said he likes to keep everyone off balance like a negotiator in a real estate deal.\n\nA White House official, for instance, told CNN's Dan Merica that a planned announcement on steps Trump will take to respond to the Florida school massacre was postponed while officials distill a coherent policy plan from the meeting.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/02/politics/donald-trump-chaos-world-tariff-steel-aluminum/index.html", "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "", "body": "While meeting with Saudi Arabia's crown prince, President Donald Trump said he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone and that they will be meeting soon.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/03/20/trump-putin-meet-soon-sot.cnn", "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Devan Cole", "body": "Sen.

The 17-year-old told CNN he was encouraged to run for office because he believes that there are some important issues regarding education that the current government is overlooking. He says if elected, he wants to raise the minimum wage and work on legalizing marijuana.\n\n\"All young voices must be heard, but to an extent,\" said Dominic Scavuzzo, 18, the Republican teen candidate for governor. He also said in theory, a 14-year-old could run for office, but someone should at least be mature enough to understand the voting process and be able to do so.\n\nScavuzzo is running for office because he believes young people should have someone their age to help them understand policies and bring transparency to important political issues such as public education spending.\n\nKansas is one of only three states, along with Vermont and Massachusetts, that don't have an age requirement to run for governor, according to the National Governors Association . The youngest current governor is Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 of Puerto Rico, who is 38 years old.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this article gave the incorrect party affiliation for Rep.

The plea could come as soon as Friday afternoon.\n\nIt comes one day after Mueller filed new charges against Gates and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. In the indictment, prosecutors described a \"scheme\" in which the two longtime business partners allegedly laundered $30 million, failed to pay taxes for almost 10 years and used real estate they owned to fraudulently secure more than $20 million in loans.\n\nAlready, the pair faced a combined 12 criminal charges in federal court in Washington, DC, for alleged money laundering and failing to disclose banking information and foreign lobbying work they did prior to 2015. A handful of Thursday's charges are also connected to the charges related to offshore accounts in the previous indictment.\n\nManafort and Gates pleaded not guilty to the charges they face in DC in October. Manafort has denied all charges against him.\n\nLast Friday, the special counsel produced grand jury indictments for 13 Russian nationals, accusing them of operating a misinformation campaign to hurt Hillary Clinton's presidential effort. Gates has been in negotiations with Mueller's office for more than a month, and that Gates had spoken to prosecutors about his case since his indictment, CNN previously reported. Defense lawyer Tom Green, who's handled the plea negotiation for Gates, told the court he'd represent Gates officially Thursday night, a strong indication that Gates was on the precipice of a plea deal with prosecutors. Gates' trial lawyers have now left the case.

Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc,\" Trump wrote. \"Isn't the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers?

Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn't the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!\n\nResponding to Trump's tweet, the attorney general said in a statement that the Justice Department \"initiated the appropriate process that will ensure complaints against this department will be fully and fairly acted upon if necessary.\"\n\n\"As long as I am the attorney general, I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor, and this department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and Constitution,\" Sessions said.\n\nSessions, appearing at a news conference announcing a new opioid task force, was asked about House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes' controversial memo outlining purported surveillance abuses and told reporters that \"the inspector general will take that as one of the matters he'll deal with.\"\n\nWhile Trump is correct that Horowitz does not have prosecutorial powers, he can -- and often does -- make criminal referrals to the Justice Department based on his investigations. An investigation into improper FISA use would fall squarely onto Horowitz, too, given his charge instructs him to \"investigate alleged violations of criminal and civil laws by DOJ employee.\"\n\nSessions chose to respond to the President because his latest jab was more \"in the weeds\" and about process, said a source familiar with Sessions' thinking.\n\nPrevious times, Trump has insulted Sessions when calling for the investigation of Hillary Clinton, but this time he called for Sessions to go after Justice Department attorneys, which was a bridge too far, said the source.\n\n\"There is a process, we are following that process,\" the source added.\n\nAs Sessions left the Billy Graham event in the Capitol on Wednesday, CNN asked for his response to Trump's tweet and criticism of him.\n\n\"I'm not commenting on that this morning. Thank you,\" he responded.\n\nAsked if he has discussed the criticism directly with the President, Sessions just said, \"Thanks.\"\n\nTrump's scathing tweet is the latest in a long line of public rebukes the President has leveled against his attorney general, a man who broke with much of his party to endorse Trump early in his presidential run.\n\nTrump's anger toward Sessions stems from his decision to recuse himself from all investigations into the 2016 campaign, including special counsel Robert Mueller's expanding investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives bent on meddling in the election. Sessions made that decision after he did not fully answer questions during his confirmation hearing about his conversations with Russian diplomats during the 2016 campaign. Trump, in turn, has said he wouldn't have named Sessions to lead the Justice Department had he known he would have recused himself.\n\nThat animosity has played out publicly ever since.\n\nAs pressure mounted on Sessions last year, his standing in the administration appeared untenable to people inside the West Wing. During the first six months of Trump's presidency, Trump asked for Sessions' resignation, called the attorney general an \"idiot\" but then later declined to accept his attorney general's resignation letter.\n\nSessions has so far weathered the incessant incoming from the White House and sources close to the attorney general have told CNN that he is unlikely to go anywhere soon. But the saga between the two top Republicans has played out in public for much of Trump's first year in office and the President's chronic antipathy towards the top law enforcement official has defined Trump's view of the Justice Department.\n\nThe latest chapter in the saga between Trump and Sessions came just one week ago, when Trump challenged Sessions to launch an investigation into the Obama administration for failing to do enough to stop the 2016 election foreign interference.", "link": null, "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kevin Liptak", "body": "It was Trump's most forceful attempt to date at dissuading Russia from continuing its election interference efforts, though he again suggested that other countries may have been involved and continued to insist the final results were not affected by Moscow.\n\nThe President said it was important to guard against meddling efforts during the midterm contests.\n\n\"I think you have to be really watching very closely. We won't allow that to happen,\" Trump said. \"We're doing a very, very deep study and we're coming out with, I think, some very strong suggestions on the '18 election.\"\n\nThe President has consistently shrugged off intelligence assessments that Moscow attempted to sway the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton. He's called the investigation into the interference, led by special counsel Robert Mueller, a \"hoax.\" And he's said he takes Russian President Vladimir Putin at his word when he denies having ordered the meddling campaign. That approach has worried some lawmakers, who say the administration isn't doing enough to prevent election interference in the future. A week ago, Adm. Mike Rogers -- director of the National Security Agency and Cyber Command chief -- told a congressional panel that he has not been granted the authority by Trump to disrupt Russian election hacking operations where they originate. \"It has not changed the calculus or the behavior on behalf of the Russians,\" Rogers said about the US response to Russia's cyber threat to date. This week, it was revealed the US State Department has yet to use tens of millions of dollars in funding that lawmakers allocated to counter Russian misinformation and propaganda, even as intelligence chiefs have warned that Russia is actively targeting the 2018 midterm elections. But on Tuesday, US Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said there are ongoing conversations between Trump and appropriate US agencies about how to counter the threat of Russian attacks on the midterm elections. \"It is a whole of government approach, I have discussed it personally with the President of the United States and he has said I assume you are doing your jobs,\" Coats said. Asked by a Swedish journalist whether he was concerned Russia could have an effect on the midterms, Trump insisted during his news conference that the US would prevent any election interference efforts. \"No, because we'll counteract whatever they do,\" he said. He encouraged states to include an analog backup to avoid attempts to hack electronic systems. \"You have to be very vigilant.

DiGenova had publicly argued that Trump had been \"framed\" by FBI and Justice Department officials. and and The New York Times and The Washington Post first reported Dowd's resignation. Dowd previously was criticized for his handling of the response to the guilty plea of Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who became the first Trump administration official to face charges in Mueller's investigation.

He has pled guilty to those lies,\" the tweet on Trump's account said. The tweet led Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, to note that the committee is investigating obstruction of justice and said: \"What we're beginning to see is the putting together of a case of obstruction of justice.\" In a testy exchange with CNN, Dowd said he authored the tweet, but then suggested it was incorrect, claiming that \"at the time of the firing no one including Justice had accused Flynn of lying.\" He declined to answer additional questions, saying: \"Enough already ... I don't feed the haters.\" The response was characteristic of Dowd's hard-charging style, which initially endeared him to the President and made him the lead attorney on the President's legal team after Trump all but discarded Kasowitz in July.

That report -- the details of which have not been publicly released -- is said to conclude that McCabe misled investigators about his role in directing other officials at the FBI to speak to The Wall Street Journal about his involvement in a public corruption investigation into the Clinton Foundation, according to a source briefed on it.\n\nCNN reported on Wednesday that the findings in Horowitz's report on McCabe were referred to the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility, staffed with career officials, who recommended McCabe's termination. McCabe, accompanied by his lawyer, tried making a last-ditch effort Thursday to avoid the firing, meeting with officials at the deputy attorney general's office at the Justice Department for several hours while Sessions was traveling, but to no avail. Horowitz's office is continuing to investigate how the Justice Department and FBI handled sensitive investigations leading up to the 2016 presidential election -- including the probe into Hillary Clinton's private email server -- and a more global report is expected this spring. That closely watched report, which Trump has derided as \" already late ,\" could prove devastating for former and current top officials at the Justice Department and FBI depending on the findings, as the President has sought to weave a narrative of biased \"deep state\" holdovers from the Obama administration determined to undermine his presidency. While former FBI officials say a lack of candor is a death knell for an agent's career, Sessions' decision to fire McCabe presented unique political complications.

I'm\u00a0so sorry to tell you what happened is unjust, not right, and everyone back there knows\u00a0that.

He has a wife who is a US citizen, and four daughters who are also US citizens. He owns several businesses in his adopted hometown of Youngstown, Ohio. A week ago, he was deported.\n\nFor more than 20 years, his life has been a legal battle. But with the help of an Ohio congressman, he was able to remain in the US. That all changed when US President Donald Trump took office last year and doubled down on immigration.\n\nImmigration arrests have increased by 42% since Trump took office, according to the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nIn the 1980s, Adi held a green card. But he lost his permanent resident status in the early 1990s, after moving to Brazil for three years with his wife. When he returned, Adi tried to apply for a new card, but was rejected.\n\nImmigration officials accused him of having a sham marriage with his American ex-wife.\n\nHis ex-wife had signed a statement\u00a0alleging marriage fraud. According to Adi, his lawyer and multiple media interviews with Adi's ex-wife, she was coerced into making the statement after immigration officials showed up at her door.\n\nIn 2007, she signed an affidavit retracting her statement and denying the marriage was fraudulent.\n\nDespite the affidavit, he was unable to gain legal status. In 2009, he was issued with a deportation order.\n\nOhio Congressman Tim Ryan describes Adi as a \"pillar\" of their community, who creates jobs with his multiple businesses and distributes hundreds of turkeys to the poor on Thanksgiving.\n\nFor years, the House Democrat has been fighting for Adi to remain in America and it was his efforts that secured consecutive stays of the deportation order.\n\n\"If you would see the breadth of support that this gentleman has, from whether it's his Italian-Irish Catholic congressman or an African-American Pentecostal Republican woman who is supporting him or the working-class people I saw in his shop the day they thought he was going to get deported ... to show support for him,\" Ryan told CNN in an interview.\n\nAmong Adi's businesses are a hooka bar, a convenience store and a deli.\n\n\"He has a Jewish attorney whose father survived the Holocaust ... this person has brought this community together in Youngstown, Ohio,\" Ryan added.\n\nWhile Adi's deportation order was issued in 2009, ICE did not proceed with the deportation. He was, instead, required to routinely check in with the agency, which he was diligent about, according to his lawyer David Leopold. In 2013, Ryan presented a private bill -- legislation specific to a person and not affecting overall policy -- to Congress, which would get him a more thorough review of his case. He has presented the bill several times since then.\n\nHaving the private bill in motion meant Adi was granted a two-year stay. Under Trump, though, ICE reduced the deportation stay to six months, according to Ryan.\n\nLast September, an ICE field office put an ankle bracelet with a GPS monitor on Adi. He was then told to make arrangements to leave the US, according to his lawyer.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, ICE said that he would be allowed to return only if the bill is finally passed.\n\n\"While ICE acknowledges Congress's authority to pass legislation providing immigration benefits to non-citizens, alien beneficiaries need not be present in the United States for a private immigration relief bill to be introduced, considered and/or enacted.\u00a0 An alien who is granted relief through the enactment of a private immigration bill can lawfully travel back to the United States,\" the statement read.\n\nAfter conducting a comprehensive review of Adi's case, ICE said in the statement that it has chosen not to grant a stay of removal.\n\nOver the past decade, Adi's immigration case has \"undergone exhaustive judicial review at multiple levels of the nation's courts, including before the immigration courts, federal appeals courts and U.S. district court. In each review, the courts have held that Adi does not have a legal basis to remain in the US,\" ICE said the statement.\n\nAdi's last few months were a rollercoaster of emotions, expecting deportation amid the ramped-up crackdown on illegal immigration\u00a0across the US as part of the Trump administration's stance on the issue.\n\nAdi and his second wife Fidaa, a US citizen, arranged to leave the United States at their own expense in early January. They sold the family home and prepared to say goodbye to everyone.\n\n\"ICE agents were to meet them at the airport and remove his ankle bracelet before he boarded the flight,\" Adi's attorney told CNN. \"On January 4th, ICE called to say that they canceled the departure date -- that he should not depart as scheduled and that no new date was set.\"\n\nBut according to Leopold, Adi was asked instead to report to ICE local headquarters on January 15\u00a0for a routine check-in to discuss the case. Adi was escorted by several supporters including Ryan, but he was taken into custody without being given a reason.\n\nAdi was not able to see his family before being put on a plane to Amman on January 30.\n\nOver the past year tens of thousands have been arrested by ICE, according to Human Rights Watch. Many, like Adi, are deeply rooted in their communities and have no criminal convictions.\n\nLast year, ICE's deputy Director Thomas D. Homan\u00a0said that under Trump's administration, undocumented immigrants \"should be afraid,\" explaining that anyone who has violated the law should be looking over their shoulder. ICE has made clear that while they still prioritize criminals, they also prioritize undocumented immigrants with final deportation orders and do not consider anyone exempt from being arrested or put into deportation proceedings.\n\n\"I don't think there is any question that this is the new normal ... To watch these families get ripped apart is the most heart-breaking thing any American citizen could ever see ... Because you are for these families, it doesn't mean you are not for a secure border,\" said Ryan.\n\n\"I am for a humane pathway for good people who want to participate in the American dream and who have contributed to this country for 40 years and are an American in every sense of the word,\" he said.\n\nA day after arriving in Amman, a city he barely recognizes now, Adi was still in shock and disbelief.\n\n\"The American dream started 40 years ago for me ... I built this whole thing scratch from nothing. Even if anybody wants to stop that American dream, I won't let them. I'm going to keep the fight going,\" an emotional Adi told CNN.\n\nThe hardest thing, he said, is being away from his family.\n\n\"I miss my wife, the kids,\" he said, choking back tears. \"I miss Youngstown.

The bill also aims to clarify that the Centers for Disease Control can conduct research on gun violence\n\nStill, a number of other gun-related bills have been introduced and many Democrats, along with some Republicans, are working to keep gun violence a top priority in Congress.\n\n\"There's a long way to go and that's what these students are here for,\" Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida said Friday at a news conference with other lawmakers and activists.\n\nRubio, who's been highly active in the gun debate since the Florida shooting, said Thursday at a news conference that his role is to legislate, rather than demonstrate.\n\n\"I am a legislator,\" Rubio said. \"I pass public policy. Instead of marching, I should be acting, I should be passing laws,\" he said. \"That doesn't mean you can't also do a march. I know some legislators will do that. But that's what I've been focused on. That's what I'll continue to focus on. That's why we are here, to announce this, because when we get back this is going to be the one thing that I think we can do next.\"\n\nRepublicans are largely keeping their distance from the rallies, though some are contributing in other ways. Rep. Carlos Curbelo, who's in an extremely competitive district in Florida and who introduced a bill this week to raise the age requirement for rifles and shotguns, announced he's donating $2,500 to help pay for transportation for Parkland students to the march in Washington.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi will also remain in Washington for the event Saturday, as well as dozens of other House Democrats, and several more will take part in events in their districts, according to her office. Pelosi encouraged members to wear orange at the rally \u2014 a color affiliated with gun violence activism \u2014 and change their social media profile photos to show the text #NeverAgain and #EndViolence.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steny Hoyer will be in New Jersey for previously scheduled travel but his office said he plans to attend two sister events for \"March for Our Lives\" on Saturday while he's there.\n\nMeanwhile, close to a dozen Senate Democrats say they plan to be at the march in Washington or meet with students around the march.

It stops here with this administration and me. I'm not going to sleep until it is fixed. And Mr. President, we'll fix it. Because I'm going to fix it. I'm not going to rest,\" he said.\n\n\"My beautiful daughter, I'm never going to see her again. It's simple. Let's fix it,\" he said.\n\nJustin Gruber, 15, who was affected by the Parkland shooting, said he was born after Columbine, which marked a new era in history.\n\n\"I was born into a world where I never got to experience safety and peace. There needs to be a significant change in this country. This has to never happen again,\" he said. \"People should be able to feel like when they go to school it can be safe. There needs to be a change. People need to feel safe. Parents shouldn't have to go through the idea of losing their child.\"\n\nTrump responded to the series of emotional stories from the survivors and parents of victims from the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School by pledging to get to work on school shootings \"two minutes\" after the listening session.\n\n\"We don't want others to go through the kind of pain you have gone through,\" Trump said. \"It wouldn't be right.\"\n\nAt the beginning of the event, the President pledged to \"do something\" about school shootings in the brief opening of his listening session.\n\n\"We are going to do something about this horrible situation that is going on,\" Trump said. \"I want to listen and then after I listen, we are going to get things done.\"\n\nTrump, flanked by the students, went around the room and shook hands before opening the event.\n\nDuring the listening session, Trump called for more mental institutions and hospitals and floated the idea of concealed carry for teachers and school staff.\n\n\"This would be obviously only for people who were very adept at handling a gun, and it would be, it's called concealed carry, where a teacher would have a concealed gun on them. They'd go for special training and they would be there and you would no longer have a gun-free zone,\" Trump said.\n\n\"Gun-free zone to a maniac -- because they're all cowards -- a gun-free zone is 'let's go in and let's attack because bullets aren't coming back at us,' \" he said.\n\nThe event comes a week after 17 people were killed at the shooting in Parkland, Florida, a massacre that has led students, parents and teachers from the school to call on Trump to take action . Students led protests in front of the White House over the weekend and another group of students walked out of schools on Wednesday gathered in front of the White House to demand action.\n\nTo date, the Trump administration has stuck to discussing taking action on guns, not actually lobbying Congress on moving any new legislation. But White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah said in a statement on Monday that Trump spoke with Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, on Friday about a bill he introduced with Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, that aims to strengthen how state and federal governments report offenses that could prohibit people from buying a gun.\n\n\"While discussions are ongoing and revisions are being considered, the President is supportive of efforts to improve the federal background check system,\" Shah said. Students, teachers and lawmakers have urged Trump and other Republican lawmakers to take action on guns in the wake of the Parkland shooting.\n\nAny action on guns would be a balancing act for Trump. His political base of Republican voters overwhelmingly disapprove of most gun control actions and the President has enjoyed the support of the NRA.\n\n\"I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun,\" he wrote in his 2000 book, \"The America We Deserve.\" \"With today's Internet technology, we should be able to tell within 72 hours if a potential gun owner has a record.\"\n\nTrump disavowed those statements during the 2016 campaign.\n\n\"We will be working very, very hard on that horrible, horrible issue that took place last week in Florida,\" Trump said at an event on Tuesday. \"We're working very hard.

The parade is expected to include dozens of intercontinental-range Hwasong-15 missiles, which the North Koreans test-fired for the first time in late November , the sources said.

He criticized independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, California Democratic Sens. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren and other high-profile Democrats, whom he accused of backing European style socialism as well creating new victimized groups and hurling insults at conservatives.\n\n\"Socialism is a movement that loves a smear,\" he said.\n\nStaring out into the audience, LaPierre told onlookers \"you should be anxious and you should be frightened\" about the potential of another Democratic takeover of the House, Senate and White House.\n\n\"If they seize power ... our American freedoms could be lost and our country will be changed forever,\" he said. \"The first to go will be the Second Amendment.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of a high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead, the country has found itself once again balancing the scope of the Second Amendment with its desire to protect kids in schools.

Rubio also told the audience he was reconsidering his past opposition to limiting the size of large gun magazines.\n\n\"I absolutely believe that in this country if you are 18 years of age, you should not be able to buy a rifle, and I will support a law that takes that right away,\" Rubio said, making the comments during a CNN town hall in Florida.\n\nLimiting the size of gun magazines and raising the age limit on buying rifles, including guns like AR-15 style rifles, are both positions that the NRA opposes.\n\n\"I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health.

And his aggression in recent days shows he has rejected an alternative course of action: muting his natural inclination to go on the offensive while Mueller deliberates his fate.\n\nSo as the President slips political constraints by shuffling his White House and foreign policy team and rages against convention, Mueller and his investigators have Trump penned in with no easy means of escape. CNN reported on Monday that Mueller's team sat down with Trump's lawyers to discuss topics investigators could inquire of the President, a clear sign the investigation isn't likely to end anytime soon.\n\nBut cornered prey can be unpredictable and prone to desperate acts, so Trump's behavior is stoking concerns that he is not just hinting that he may can Mueller -- he may actually do it.\n\n\"We are fast approaching a crossroads ... where the United States is going to have to be confronted with a decision about whether we value the rule of law,\" Richard Ben-Veniste, a former Watergate special prosecutor, told CNN's Erin Burnett on Monday.\n\n\"This continued attack against Mueller, against the Department of Justice and against the FBI is a pretext for Mr Trump eventually to fire Mr. Mueller, I believe.\"\n\nTrying to forcibly end the special counsel investigation would set up the ultimate test of the Republican Party's so far staunch unwillingness to desert its President, and could have a huge impact on the political environment for November's midterm elections.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said there was \"no collusion\" between his campaign and Russia and no other wrongdoing. If that is the case, allowing Mueller to finish his investigation would provide vindication. But it's obvious that Trump sees the probe as so unfair and a conspiracy against him that is damaging his presidency -- a factor that may be inducing him to act as if he has something to hide, even if he doesn't.\n\nAnd sitting powerless, while Mueller indicts people in his outer circle, pores over his financial records and looms ever closer to the Oval Office by the week is a scenario that is clearly driving Trump to distraction.\n\nSo it's reasonable to assume that diGenova's appointment represents Trump's frustration with his legal team and his limited options, following a weekend of conflicting statements from its members on the issue of Mueller's continued employment.\n\nThe President's fury over his plight erupted in a series of attacks on Mueller over the weekend, culminating in an anguished tweet Monday lambasting an investigation he believes is part of an establishment plot to destroy him.\n\n\"A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!\" Trump wrote, apparently testing out a rationale for the firing of Mueller, days after he singled out the special counsel by name in his attacks for the first time.\n\nIf that was a trial balloon for anything more than an effort to discredit Mueller's eventual findings, the President got a swift answer as several senior GOP senators warned that trying to rid himself of the Mueller probe would be disastrous.\n\nSen. John Cornyn of Texas said it would be a \"bad idea\" for Trump to sack Mueller, while Maine Sen. Susan Collins said such a step would be a \"a terribly serious mistake.\"\n\nGOP senators who don't have to face Trump voters anymore had more freedom. Utah's Orrin Hatch, for instance, said terminating Mueller would be \"the stupidest thing\" the President could do.\n\nToppling Mueller, with its constitutional implication of a President trying to evade accountability, would make the uproar following former FBI Director James Comey's firing last year pale by comparison. After all, jettisoning the former FBI director demonstrably made Trump's political and legal exposure over the Russia investigation much worse.\n\nIn fact, the only potential scenario in which Trump could benefit by firing Mueller would be if he does indeed have something to hide from the special counsel and he is able to permanently derail the investigation.\n\n\"Let's posit for a moment that there is something there ... in which case it is not the stupidest thing in the world to attack Mueller,\" David Priess, a former senior CIA officer and national security and intelligence author, told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Monday.\n\n\"There may be something much worse out there, in which case this is not a stupid strategy at all. This would be protecting against the worst case scenario,\" Priess said.\n\nAny attempt to dismiss Mueller would be complicated, however, and would require Trump to get rid of Attorney General Jeff Sessions -- who recused himself from involvement in 2016 election investigations -- and replace him with an interim successor who would consent to ordering the end of the investigation.\n\nIf the President is unwilling to go that far, the hiring of diGenova at least could settle his nerves and offer him an outspoken defender to bolster his under-gunned counterattack in the media.\n\nDiGenova is just the latest new entrant in Trump's circle who shares the President's combative mindset and is likely to take a far more aggressive public stance in defense of Trump than his current legal team has done.\n\nLike new top economic adviser Larry Kudlow, diGenova is a talented performer on television. He's a regular on Fox News, the President's favorite source of political intelligence. Like Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo, he doesn't mince words and his appointment fits the President's emerging pattern of surrounding himself with subordinates who mirror his bravado and combativeness.\n\nShowing his stomach for the fight, diGenova on Monday slammed what he said was disarray at the FBI under its director, Christopher Wray.\n\n\"What does that tell you about the FBI director? It tells you he is a coward,\" diGenova told WMAL radio.\n\nDiGenova shares Trump's disdain for Comey, as well, once calling Comey his \"own hagiographer\" and a \"danger to this country\" on Fox.\n\nDiGenova also has advanced conspiracy theories that the Russia investigation is an FBI plot to delegitimize Trump's presidency.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/20/politics/donald-trump-robert-mueller-lawyer/index.html", "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Terence Burlij", "body": "Washington (CNN) The results of Tuesday's special election in western Pennsylvania offer an ominous sign for Republican hopes of defending the House this fall. CNN is making changes to its rating of 17 House races -- all of them in the direction of the Democrats.\n\nDemocrat Conor Lamb is poised to deliver a stunning upset in a district that President Donald Trump won by 20 percentage points less than two years ago. That performance, combined with 2017 wins in Alabama, Virginia and New Jersey, and strong showings in previous special elections, all reflect the headwinds Republicans are facing in November's midterm elections.\n\nIn light of Tuesdays results, there are several districts that now appear more favorable for Democrats this year, with a similar mix of candidate quality, district composition and, in some cases, concerns about the Republican incumbent, or they represent open seats.\n\nOf the 12 races CNN now rates Lean Democratic, 8 are currently held by Republicans. Of the 21 races CNN rates Tossup, 19 are held by Republicans. Democrats need to pick up 23 seats in order to take control of the House in November.\n\nIL-12: Democrats have tried to recruit Brendan Kelly to run before, but he's held off until now. The St. Clair County prosecutor hails from a voter-rich part of the district and outraised GOP Rep. Mike Bost in the final quarter of 2017. Trump won this district by 14 points, but Barack Obama carried it by two points in 2012. This district has a history of voting Democratic, so it should offer an even better opportunity for Democrats than PA-18. Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-up.\n\nMI-08: This is another Midwest contest where Democrats have cleared the field for a top recruit, former intelligence official Elissa Slotkin. She's challenging Rep. Mike Bishop, who won this district that includes Detroit exurbs and Lansing by 17 points in 2016. Trump carried the district by six points, and Romney won it by just three points in 2012. Slotkin also raised $140,000 more than Bishop the last three months of 2017, though still trails in cash on hand by about $260,000. Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-Up.\n\nMI-11: Republican Rep. Dave Trott's retirement from this district -- home of Chrysler and many of the American auto giants' workers -- left it vulnerable to a Democratic takeover. Trump carried it by 4 points in 2016, but this district has several characteristics that suggest a strong shift is coming. Among them: It's suburban, and it's dominated by the auto industry, which means Trump's new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports (which make vehicles' components more expensive) likely won't be popular. Democrats still have a crowded primary to sort out, but they'll be watching the Detroit suburbs closely. Race moves from Toss-Up to Lean Democratic.\n\nMN-03: Republican Erik Paulsen won this district comprising the suburbs west of the Twin Cities by 14 points in 2016 -- but Hillary Clinton bested Trump here by nine points. It also went narrowly for Obama in 2012. Democrats are touting Dean Phillips, the former CEO of his family's distillery company and former co-owner of Talenti Gelato. He's keeping close in fundraising, trailing Paulsen by about $90,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017, but has a cash-on-hand deficit of more than $900,000. Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-Up.\n\nNJ-02: With the retirement of GOP Rep. Frank LoBiondo, this seat is high up on the target list for Democrats. The party has put state Sen. Jeff Van Drew on its Red-to-Blue list. The moderate Democrat, a gun rights supporter, does have a primary against Tanzie Youngblood. There is a crowded field on the GOP side. This district, which includes Atlantic City and some Philadelphia exurbs, went for Obama by eight points and Trump by four. Race moves from Toss-Up to Lean Democratic.\n\nNJ-07: A once-crowded primary field for Democrats has started to narrow, and Tom Malinowski is the beneficiary. The former assistant secretary of state in the Obama administration saw two primary opponents drop out last month and endorse him -- that after he more than doubled GOP Rep. Leonard Lance in fundraising during the final quarter of last year. Hillary Clinton won this north central New Jersey district by a single point in 2016 while Lance won it by 11 points. Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-Up.\n\nNC-09: This is a tough district for Democrats. But so was Pennsylvania 18. Democrat Dan McCready is a top recruit who has outraised GOP Rep. Robert Pittenger for three consecutive quarters and has $600,000 more in the bank. Pittenger also faces a primary challenge from Mark Harris, who he defeated in the 2016 GOP primary by a single percentage point. The district includes South Charlotte and shares a border with South Carolina -- a similar dynamic to what Democrats were facing in PA-18. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.\n\nNC-13: Freshman GOP Rep. Ted Budd won this north central North Carolina district by 12 points in 2016 as Trump was carrying it by nine. Democrats are lining up behind Kathy Manning, a philanthropist and former lawyer, who crushed Budd in fundraising in the fourth quarter of 2017 and has roughly $220,000 more cash-on-hand. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.\n\nPA-17: The dust hasn't settled from Tuesday's special election, but regardless of the result it shows Democratic strength in southwestern Pennsylvania. This newly-drawn district is a much more competitive seat for GOP Rep. Keith Rothfus to defend. Assuming Conor Lamb decides to run in this district that includes suburbs west of Pittsburgh, it will be one of the most closely-watched contests come November. Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-Up.\n\nVA-07: This district that includes Richmond suburbs has been trending Democratic in recent years. Trump's performance here dipped from Romney's showing four years earlier. Republican Ed Gillespie won it by less than four points in last year's gubernatorial contest. GOP Rep. Dave Brat stunned the political world when he knocked off Eric Cantor in the GOP primary in 2014. Now he's poised for a challenge of his own from one of two Democrats who outraised him at the end of last year -- former CIA officer Abigail Spanberger or Marine Corps veteran Dan Ward. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.\n\nWI-01: This is House Speaker Paul Ryan's district, and it's likely to stay that way in November. Ryan can raise as much money as he wants, is universally known in his district and won't make the mistake of sleeping on Democratic challenger Randy Bryce. But Bryce has some things going for him, too. He's branded himself effectively (the mustachioed ironworker and Army veteran's Twitter handle is @IronStache). His longshot bid against Ryan will make him a small-dollar fundraising star. And southeastern Wisconsin is actually friendlier territory to Democrats than southwestern Pennsylvania was. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.\n\nIn addition to those moves, we are shifting FL-06 and TX-21 from Safe Republican to Likely Republican. In Florida, GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis is leaving his seat to run for governor -- and Democrats believe former ambassador Nancy Soderberg gives them a chance in this open contest. While in Texas, Rep. Lamar Smith's retirement creates an open seat with May runoffs for Republicans and Democrats to determine who will face-off for this district that includes parts of Austin and area north of San Antonio. Smith won the district by 21 points; Trump won it by 10.\n\nGiven the current national environment we are also moving several Democratic-held seats to more favorable positions. Two open seats -- NV-03 and NH-01 -- go from Toss-Up to Lean Democratic. Democrats are happy with the candidates running in those districts, and in the case of New Hampshire, no Republican candidate seems to have caught fire.\n\nTwo other seats with Democratic incumbents seeking reelection move from Lean Democratic to Likely Democratic: FL-07 and NJ-05. For Republicans, the name of the game in 2018 is defense, not offense, with two open Democratic seats in Minnesota representing the GOP's best pick-up opportunities.\n\nThose are today's moves, but there are a number of other races we're watching closely to see whether they inch in Democrats' direction. In Utah, Ben McAdams (challenging GOP Rep. Mia Love in the 4th District) has run well with Mitt Romney on the ballot before. In central Arkansas' 2nd District, Clarke Tucker was Democrats' dream recruit to take on two-term Rep. French Hill. Two Ohio races -- the 1st District, where Aftab Pureval is challenging Rep. Steve Chabot in what used to be solidly Republican Cincinnati suburbs, and the 12th District, where voters will replace retired Rep. Pat Tiberi in an August special election -- bear watching. In KY-06, we're waiting to see whether Lexington Mayor Jim Gray or veteran Amy McGrath wins the primary. And in KS-02, Democratic challenger Paul Davis is worth keeping an eye on, in part because he's already made clear that, like Lamb, he's opposing Pelosi. Democrats had struggled to recruit a strong challenger to Rep. David Valadao in CA-21, a Central Valley district, businessman TJ Cox \u2014 who'd been running in the 10th District against Rep. Jeff Denham \u2014 changed his mind and said he'll move from Modesto back home to Fresno and run against Valadao in this district Hillary Clinton won by 15 percentage points.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct a rating change in the text for IL-12 and in the graphic for NJ-02.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/16/politics/house-key-races-pennsylvania-results-update/index.html", "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Veronica Stracqualursi", "body": "\"The funds were taken from my home equity line and transferred internally to my LLC account in the same bank,\" Michael Cohen said in a statement.\n\nCohen also confirmed that he used his Trump Organization email account to communicate details of a payment transfer to Stephanie Clifford, the adult film star known as Stormy Daniels, who allegedly had an affair with the President before his time in office.\n\nEarlier Friday, Clifford's lawyer, Michael Avenatti, provided an email to CNN in which Cohen confirmed the transfer to Daniels' former attorney, Keith Davidson.

Any involvement by Trump would indicate the payment was an in-kind campaign contribution which was not disclosed to the Federal Election Commission, which would be a violation of federal law, according to Paul S. Ryan, a campaign finance attorney who works for Common Cause. The email does not say where the funds originated from. Law firm handling Stormy Daniels case for Cohen also did legal work with Trump campaign NBC News first reported Cohen's use of the email account. The day after the email, Cohen wired money from First Republic Bank to Davidson's bank account, according to NBC News. Davidson did not respond to a request for comment from CNN. First Republic Bank declined to comment to the network. Trump's 2017 financial disclosures listed an account at First Republic Bank, valued between $15,001 and $50,000. Cohen also regularly used that same email account to negotiate with Clifford last year before she signed a nondisclosure agreement, NBC News reported. Last month, Cohen said he wired Clifford $130,000 of his own money right before the 2016 election in exchange for her silence about the alleged affair. Cohen said Friday that he is in the midst of a \"witch hunt,\" saying, \"These incessant attacks against me are meritless and are concocted by the liberal mainstream media to continue to malign our President and distract the country from his historic achievements over the past year. This witch hunt has now gone from ludicrous to insane.\" He has denied the Trump Organization's involvement in the payment, and both Cohen and the White House have denied any sexual encounter between the President and Clifford. \"In a private transaction in 2016, I used my own personal funds to facilitate a payment of $130,000 to Ms. Stephanie Clifford,\" Cohen said in a statement in February. \"Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly.\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that \"arbitration was won in the President's favor\" regarding the case. The statement is an admission that the nondisclosure agreement exists and that it directly involves Trump. It was the first time the White House had admitted the President was involved in any way with Clifford.

Mike Crapo, the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, passed 67 to 31, marking a rare occurrence of old-fashioned legislating on a bipartisan bill that nevertheless sharply divided Democrats.\n\nThe legislation will now move to the House, where it will need to be reconciled with possible fixes proposed by Rep. Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nA White House press secretary said in a statement that President Donald Trump supports Crapo's bill and would sign it into law. Still, the White House left the door open to possible changes that could be made by House lawmakers as long as the bipartisan bill reaches the president's desk \"as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe proposal provides long-awaited relief to thousands of community banks and dozens of regional lenders including Zions Bancorp, BB&T and SunTrust. It will also loosen regulations for mortgage lenders, expand access to free credit freezes for Americans and change rules for student loan defaults.\n\n\"This bill shows that we can work together and can do big things that make a big difference in the lives of people across this country,\" said Crapo on the Senate floor ahead of the vote.\n\nThe bill's passage was a defeat for progressive Democrats, who strongly opposed easing regulations for some banks, warning that doing so would likely trigger another financial crisis.\n\n\"This legislation threatens to undo important rules protecting us from risk,\" Sen. Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the banking panel, said earlier this week on the Senate floor. \"This legislation again puts taxpayers on the hook for bailouts.\"\n\nProgressives pointed to several critical changes in the bill that would release more than two dozen regional banks from stricter oversight by the Fed and would make it easier for Wall Street banks to fight off existing regulations.\n\n\"Buried down in the details of the bill are more landmines for American families\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said on the Senate floor ahead of the chamber's vote. \"Washington has become completely disconnected from the real problem in people's lives.\"\n\nThe bill raises the threshold at which banks are considered too big to fail. That trigger, once set at $50 billion in assets, would rise to $250 billion. It would leave only a dozen US banks -- including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo -- facing the strictest regulations.\n\nThe measure would also shield more than two dozen banks from some Fed oversight under the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory law. Those banks would no longer be required to have plans to be safely dismantled if they fail. And they would have to take the Fed's bank health test only periodically, not once a year.\n\nModerate Democrats accused progressives of overstating provisions in the bill and the likely impact it could have on the economy. Instead, they argued they have to respond to the distinct political and banking needs in their states, which they say have been hurt by consolidation in the banking industry since the law was passed.\n\n\"They don't understand where we live,\" said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a moderate Democrat from North Dakota who is up for re-election, on the chamber floor. \"They don't understand who we are. They don't understand we live in communities and that we support and protect each other. Instead, they write one regulation that's supposed to be one-size-fits-all.\"\n\nMany of the measure's Democratic cosponsors hail from rural states won by Trump. Their support for the long-sought changes may demonstrate to their voters, many who voted for Trump, that they can work with the President and not reflexively oppose anything he supports.\n\nAhead of Wednesday's vote, Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, defended his support for the bill, arguing he would never back remedies that would put the financial system at risk.\n\n\"Let me be clear that I will do nothing and support no legislation that seriously undermines or cuts back on the provisions and the systemic protections that were put in place,\" Warner said on the chamber floor. \"But eight years later ... there is widespread agreement that some of the standards we set in Dodd-Frank needed time for review.\"\n\nThose cap changes include exempting community banks with $10 billion or less in assets from having to comply with the so-called Volcker Rule, a regulation that bars financial institutions from making risky bets with money insured by taxpayers.\n\nIt also stops banks that originate 500 or fewer mortgages each year from having to collect racial data on their loans. Under a 1975 law, financial institutions are required to report the race, ethnicity and ZIP codes of borrowers so regulators can make sure they aren't discriminating in lending.\n\nSome new consumer protections were also added to the bill including offering Americans free credit freezes and barring lenders from declaring a student loan in default when a co-signer dies or declares bankruptcy.\n\nIt's not just progressives who've highlighted negative consequences from the changes to the bill. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office weighed in with its take on Monday, before the initial vote, and came to the conclusion that the bill, if passed, would increase the chances of another 2008-style collapse.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/14/politics/banking-bill-vote-mike-crapo/index.html", "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Katelyn Polantz", "body": "He is scheduled for sentencing on April 3.\n\nUntil then, the FBI will keep van der Zwaan's passport, and he won't be allowed to travel outside the US. Van der Zwaan must stay in Washington, DC, and Manhattan, where his attorneys are based, until his sentencing, and a judge must review his requests to travel elsewhere within the United States. His sentencing is set at a relatively early date, because his wife is facing a difficult pregnancy in London, his defense attorney told the judge.\n\nHis wife, Eva Kahn, the daughter of Russian billionaire German Khan, is due in August.\n\nVan der Zwaan becomes the fourth guilty plea in the Mueller investigation after Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos and former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to investigators last year, and an online supplier of fake usernames pleaded guilty to identity fraud last week. Mueller has also indicted 13 Russians for their work to influence the 2016 presidential election through online social media.\n\nUnlike other defendants, Van der Zwaan did not enter into an ongoing cooperation agreement with the special counsel's office.\n\nVan der Zwaan's conversation with the special counsel's office in which he allegedly lied happened three days after Manafort and Gates were charged with crimes related to their work for Ukrainian politicians and other business. Both have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn early November, prosecutors questioned van der Zwaan on his work with international law firm Skadden Arps. They were investigating Manafort's, Gates' and other individuals' compliance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which governs foreign lobbying and propaganda work for foreign governments in the US, and wanted to know who paid for a Ukrainian report on the trial of a former prime minister and how it was paid for, prosecutors said in court Tuesday.\n\nVan der Zwaan spoke with the special counsel's office a second time in early December to confess to his inaccuracies and what he knew, according to prosecutors' statements in court and a plea agreement released Tuesday.\n\nManafort arranged for the law firm to help the Ukrainian minister of justice in 2012 report on the trial of Yulia Tymoshenko, a former Ukrainian prime minister opposed to Manafort's clients.\n\nAt least one public relations firm worked on the rollout of Skadden's report with Gates and Manafort. In total, Manafort and Gates funneled $4 million to facilitate the rollout of the Ukrainian report in the US and Europe, prosecutors said Tuesday.\n\nVan der Zwaan worked with Manafort, Gates and the public relations firm in 2012 to fashion a public spin on the Ukrainian report without his law firm's knowledge.\n\nHe had given a public relations firm a copy of the report before its public release, and handed Gates talking points about the report that would help the Ukrainian clients, against the direction of a more senior lawyer at the Skadden law firm, according to court documents and prosecutors' descriptions in court.\n\nTymoshenko, the subject of the report, is one of the top political rivals of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a Russian sympathizer who used Manafort and Gates as political consultants for more than a decade. After Yanukovych narrowly defeated Tymoshenko in the 2010 presidential election, she was jailed on charges of corruption that were seen by many as being politically motivated.\n\nSkadden produced a report -- intended to be independent -- that said the process was legal. She was freed after Yanukovych's ouster in 2014.\n\nThe prosecutors' criminal charge Tuesday explains how van der Zwaan was in touch with Gates and an unnamed colleague of Gates' who was principally based in Ukraine again in September 2016. They discussed how a criminal complaint in Ukraine could implicate a former Ukrainian official, Skadden and Manafort himself. The calls were encrypted, and van der Zwaan recorded them and took notes, prosecutors said. At the time, Gates was working with the Trump campaign. Van der Zwaan had first told prosecutors his last interaction with Gates was an \"innocuous text message\" in August 2016, leaving out his involvement in the Ukrainian legal discussion. Van Der Zwaan also deleted and then failed to produce emails he exchanged in Russian in September 2016 with the unnamed person, called \"Person A\" in court. One of them discussed how the Ukrainian criminal court action was \"essentially the tip of the iceberg,\" prosecutor Andrew Weissmann said in court Tuesday. When asked by prosecutors why they hadn't seen those emails, van der Zwaan told them he had no idea, and that he hadn't responded to the business associate. But he \"knew full well why we didn't get it,\" Weissmann said Tuesday. Throughout van der Zwaan's court appearance, the navy-suited defendant leaned far back in his chair and removed his glasses as the judge reviewed his paperwork. At other times, he stood beside his criminal defense attorney William Schwartz to respond to the judge that he understood his plea and his legal rights. Around the time of the conversations van der Zwaan lied about, Manafort was in the spotlight for the work he and Gates did in Ukraine. The New York Times reported that secret documents uncovered in Ukraine listed millions of dollars in illegal payments meant for Manafort, and CNN reported that Manafort's lobbying firm was under scrutiny by the FBI and Justice Department. Days after these reports in mid-August 2016, Manafort resigned from the Trump campaign. There's no indication from the document that van der Zwaan was in touch with Gates about the political adviser's work in the election, though the charging document is the first evidence that prosecutors have sought -- and potentially even received emails and recorded phone calls related to -- Gates' interactions while he worked for Donald Trump. The separate charges Gates faces in federal court involve activities related to his Ukrainian work with Manafort in years prior to their Trump campaign work. By the numbers: The Trump orbit's contacts with Russians Skadden Arps said in a statement Tuesday that the firm terminated van der Zwaan's employment last year and is cooperating with authorities. Van der Zwaan was based in London for the firm. He is the son-in-law of Russian billionaire German Khan, who is one of the most prominent businessmen in Russia. Khan co-founded Alfa Group, a large financial conglomerate, and was recently named in the Treasury Department's list of Russian oligarchs. CNN reported last year that the FBI examined whether there was a computer server connection during the 2016 presidential campaign between Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization, though there isn't any indication that van der Zwaan is connected to that matter. Asked about the charge, White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah told Fox News that the development is unrelated to the President's actions and \"only reinforces our point when it comes to the special counsel's investigation ... there is no evidence of collusion because none existed.\" Gates, meanwhile, has had attorneys working on a plea deal with Mueller's office for more than a month, indicating he's poised to cooperate in the investigation, sources familiar with the case told CNN last week. But no deal has materialized as of Tuesday morning. He has already spoken to Mueller's team about his case multiple times, CNN first reported last week. His cooperation could be another building block for Mueller in a possible case against Trump or key members of his team. The many unearthed interactions between Trump-world and Russia, documented It would also increase the pressure to cooperate on Manafort, who has pleaded not guilty to Mueller's indictment and is preparing for a trial on alleged financial crimes unrelated to the campaign. Gates pleaded not guilty on October 30 alongside Manafort. On Friday night, Mueller's office indicated it had unearthed even more evidence of alleged crimes committed by Manafort, related to bank fraud and mortgages on his homes.

Lamb's performance is ominous for the GOP as it heads into November's midterm elections. Even a narrow Lamb win would signal that the GOP is in danger even in districts considered safe for Republicans, raising Democratic hopes of capturing the House and maybe the Senate in November.

The hypocrisy hangs in the air and chokes anyone with a sense of decency or intellectual honesty.\"\n\nHe is 100% right.\n\nThe simple fact is that Republicans in the Obama era defined themselves primarily as committed to reducing government spending and shrinking the nation's debt. The ur-document of that age was Paul Ryan's budget, in which he proudly touted the need to confront entitlement spending and make the hard cuts necessary to keep the country solvent for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"Our debt is a threat to this country,\" Ryan said in a 2013 speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference. \"We have to tackle this problem before it tackles us.\" He was far from alone. Republicans insisted that any spending legislation -- even for disaster relief -- be paid for with budget offsets. Every major Republican leader talked about debt and deficit relentlessly. That focus on deficit reduction and spending restraint bled into the 2016 primary as the top tier candidates -- including Paul -- championed it. One candidate, however, did not. That candidate was Donald Trump, the self-proclaimed \"king of debt.\" Trump showed little care or concern for the issue that had animated the party he was running to lead. So cavalier was Trump about the deficit that Mitt Romney, the party's 2012 presidential nominee, lambasted him for it in a speech aimed at convincing Republicans to drop Trump \"His tax plan in combination with his refusal to reform entitlements and honestly address spending would balloon the deficit and the national debt,\" said Romney. And then Trump won. Not just the Republican primary, but the election. And suddenly his priorities -- immigration, trade protectionism and a tax cut -- became the party's principles. Curtailing spending and reducing debt went out the window -- or at least way down the list of what the GOP cared about. And Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and almost the entire rest of the Republican Party -- sans Paul and a handful of House conservatives -- went along for the ride. Which is how it came to pass that just before 6 p.m. Thursday, McConnell was on the Senate floor pleading with his home-state colleague to drop his push for a vote on an amendment that would maintain the current budget caps. Paul's issue was a simple one: A two-year spending bill that would increase the federal deficit by more than $300 billion was being rammed through at the last minute -- and without any amendments being offered. And he's right about that too. The natural result of our current style of governing -- lurching from crisis to crisis -- is this sort of showdown. Paul is right that it is absolutely ridiculous that a near-700-page piece of legislation that senators got their hands on around midnight Wednesday should be passed by midnight Thursday. And yet, when you are faced with the possibility of a second government shutdown in the space of 17 days, passing this sort of legislation -- whether or not it represents a massive U-turn on the very priorities your party touted just a few years ago -- becomes your only option. Which makes Paul either a principled hero or a misguided Don Quixote -- depending on where you stand. \"The reason I'm here tonight is to put people on the spot,\" Paul said. \"I want people to feel uncomfortable.

It's hard enough for polls to forecast a winner within a week of an election. It's entirely unreasonable to believe they can forecast a winner at this point.\n\n3 big things revealed by Donald Trump's tweet that he could knock out Joe Biden What the polls are good for is telling you who comes to Democratic voters' minds when thinking about who they believe is the leader or next leader of the party. And right now, that person is Biden. In an average of national polls taken this year, he's polling at 27% among a field of potential Democratic contenders in 2020. The only person close to him is Sen. Bernie Sanders who is at 21%. Sanders is earning far below the 43% he won in the 2016 primary . Biden, meanwhile, is earning far higher than 0.2% he took in 2008 . No one else comes close to either candidate. Biden even leads in New Hampshire, which is right next to Sanders' home state of Vermont and where he crushed Clinton in the 2016 primary. A February University of New Hampshire survey put Biden at 35% to Sanders at 24%. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, from next-door Massachusetts, was the only other candidate polling in the double-digits. Biden, who has been running for president going back 30 years, is in the best position he has ever been at this point to claim the Democratic nomination for president. Before this go-round, very few Democrats thought of Biden as the leader at this point in the nascent primary campaign. Before Biden ran for president in the 1988 campaign, he started off in a deep hole. Less than 1% of Democrats selected him as their choice to be the Democratic nominee in a February 1986 ABC News/Washington Post poll for the 1988 Democratic nomination. This was good for dead last. Eventually, Biden's campaign would go down amid a plagiarism scandal There were also talks of a Biden campaign in 2004 . Again, few Democrats thought of Biden as the obvious next choice. He sat in ninth place at a little over 2% in an average of 2004 primary polls taken between January and March of 2002. Biden didn't end up running. Biden actually did pull the trigger on a 2008 campaign. He shot up to an average 4% in the early primary polls (January to March 2006) that cycle. Still, he was in a distant fifth place and would drop out after a poor showing at the Iowa Caucus. It was after this campaign that Biden arguably caught the break of a political lifetime. He became Barack Obama's running-mate and was elected to be vice-president. You would think that this would have made him the top choice for Democrats in 2016. But, Biden ran into the electoral bulldozer Hillary Clinton. The former secretary of state was polling in the 60s and 70s in early primary polls, the highest percentage ever for a non-incumbent. Biden's 12% did place him second, but clearly he wasn't the leader of the party. Biden would end up announcing in late 2015 that he was taking a pass on 2016. Now though, there is no Clinton for Biden to contend with. He is, after more than 30 years, the leader of the Democratic field. Biden has a straight shot at the Republican president. He's going around campaigning like he will run for president, and there's no real reason to doubt it's a strong possibility.

Sources with knowledge of McMaster's standing in the White House have repeatedly said that he has been on thin ice for months. There was discussion in the West Wing about replacing him last fall, but he ultimately survived because officials, including the President himself, were skeptical about the optics of appointing a third national security adviser in less than a year, several sources told CNN. Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned within a month of taking the job amid controversy over his contact with Russian officials. McMaster was also retained at the time due to the White House's challenge attracting top talent for jobs in the administration due to Trump's \"blacklist\" of individuals who have criticized the President, his personality and the Russia investigation, according to a senior Republican source.", "link": null, "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Katelyn Polantz", "body": "The charging document also says he exchanged an \"innocuous text message\" with Gates in mid-August 2016, and said falsely that was their last interaction.\n\nHe also deleted and then failed to produce emails he exchanged with the unnamed person in September.\n\nThere's no indication from the document that Van Der Zwaan was in touch with Gates about the political adviser's work in the election, though the charging document is the first evidence that prosecutors have sought -- and potentially even received emails and recorded phone calls related to -- Gates' interactions while he worked for Trump.

The State Department declined to comment on the record, but a senior State official who shared the guidance email with CNN said it instructed them to \"freeze further amplification of content that features (Secretary Tillerson)\" until Tillerson himself delivered remarks later in the day.\n\nThe full guidance seen by CNN \"asked all Department bureaus and posts to freeze further amplification of content or messaging which features S (Tillerson) -- this includes both the native posting and/or retweeting/sharing of statements, photos, media notes, videos, or other digital content.\" That senior State Department official told CNN that the message was \"a request from a deputy assistant secretary to hold off, until the secretary had done his briefing.\" But the tone and content of that guidance didn't sit well with many employees, as Goldstein's recounting of Tillerson's firing was already being quoted and retweeted and was not being disputed by the State Department.

Rick Saccone, a Monmouth University poll released on the eve of the 18th District election shows.\n\nIt's left the GOP bracing for what would be its most embarrassing -- and ominous -- loss since Donald Trump took office. Republicans have spent more than $10 million to prevent a defeat in the district, which Trump won in 2016 by 20 percentage points.\n\nIf Lamb wins, or even comes close, it will be a signal that Republicans are in danger even in districts where Trump was won handily in 2016, and raise Democratic hopes of capturing the House and Senate this fall. The race would also serve as a model for Democrats running in deep-red districts across the country.\n\n\"The world is watching,\" Trump said in an appearance in the district Saturday night, upping the pressure for Saccone to deliver on Tuesday.\n\nTrump touts GOP candidate \u2014 and talks drug dealers, 2020 and Oprah in whirlwind rally The race is all about the psychological fallout. Republicans have suffered major losses during Trump's presidency, including a blowout in the Virginia gubernatorial race and a loss in Alabama's Senate race. But those races were more easily explained. The GOP already knows the suburban areas where they were walloped in Virginia are at risk, and in Alabama, Roy Moore faced credible accusations of child molestation. A series of 39 red-to-blue flips in state legislative races got less national attention, though they continued to show an enthusiastic Democratic base. And the party had managed to hold on in House races, including one in the Atlanta suburbs last spring. It's a white, blue-collar region that has overwhelmingly backed Republicans in recent presidential elections. And, unlike last year's contests, Republicans now can tout the tax bill that they had hoped would be a persuasive selling point in key races. Particularly worrying for Republicans is that Lamb has managed to parry the attacks they've hoped will work across the map. He aired a television ad noting that he opposes House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who is deeply unpopular with conservative voters. Lamb has run to the right of most Democrats on a series of issues. He's said he personally opposes abortion. His first campaign ad featured him shooting a semiautomatic rifle, and he's opposed new gun control measures in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, shootings. He's also supported Trump's steel tariffs, muting what the President hoped would be a major selling point for Saccone. National Republicans have done everything possible to save the district. Trump visited twice, including a rally Saturday night where he spoke for 75 minutes and whipped supporters up to back Saccone. \"This guy should win easily,\" Trump said, pointing to the size of his own victory there. 'The Steel Curtain is gone': Trump's trade moves may be of no help in Pennsylvania special election Vice President Mike Pence, Donald Trump Jr., top White House aide Kellyanne Conway and other senior Republicans visited the district, too. House Republicans poured cash onto the Pittsburgh airways and into get-out-the-vote programs. The National Republican Congressional Committee spent $3.5 million. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan, spent $3.3 million. The Republican National Committee chipped in $1.1 million and ran a massive field program, while the Trump-aligned super PAC America First Action spent $1 million. Democrats, meanwhile, spent relatively little: Patriot Majority PAC spent $450,000 and Vote Vets spent $344,000. Several other groups spent smaller amounts, largely on digital advertising. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent $260,000 on television advertising. The lower Democratic spending was in part because the party is gearing up for dozens of races in districts with a recent history of voting more Democratic in presidential races this fall -- and in part because they didn't need to spend money to back Lamb. He outraised Saccone by a nearly five-to-one margin, hauling in $3 million by the most recent campaign finance reports filed February 21. Fearful of a loss, Republicans are downplaying expectations and trashing Saccone as a candidate. The GOP's attempt to downplay the race's importance appears to center on two key factors: Saccone's weak candidacy, explained through his paltry fundraising, and the district's Democratic voter registration advantage, even though that edge isn't reflected in its recent presidential or congressional voting history. Trump has closely followed the race for weeks and received multiple briefings on it last week, a senior White House official said. The official said Trump views Saccone as a weak candidate and is aware that he's struggled to raise money -- but that Trump went into his rally Saturday hoping to move the needle for Saccone with his base of blue-collar supporters, particularly in the wake of his steel tariff announcement. When Trump stood on stage with Saccone in Moon Township on Saturday, he made clear the pressure for a GOP win Tuesday. \"I hate to put this pressure on you, Rick,\" Trump said. \"They're all watching because I won this district, like, by 22 points.

But that's not the point.\n\nThe point is this : The indictments of a baker's dozen of Russians gives us a very clear window into not only the depth and breadth of the Mueller investigation, but also makes crystal clear what the Russians wanted in the 2016 election and the elaborate measures they undertook to make it happen.\n\n\"Defendant ORGANIZATION had a strategic goal to sow discord in the U.S. political system, including the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Defendants posted derogatory information about a number of candidates, and by early to mid-2016, Defendants' operations included supporting the presidential campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump (\"Trump Campaign\") and disparaging Hillary Clinton. Defendants made various expenditures to carry out those activities, including buying political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities. Defendants also staged political rallies inside the United States, and while posing as U.S. grassroots entities and U.S. persons, and without revealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation, solicited and compensated real U.S. persons to promote or disparage candidates. Some Defendants, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities.\"\n\nOK. So what we know from that paragraph of the charging documents, which you can read in full here , is this: By \"early to mid-2016,\" Russians had decided to use whatever means at their disposal to help Donald Trump win. The Russians bought political ads on social media sites and organized political rallies to achieve those goals. Russians, disguising their identities, \"communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump campaign\" in an attempt to \"coordinate political activities.\" None of that is a smoking gun of collusion. \"Unwitting\" members of Trumpworld working with Russians, who didn't identify themselves as Russians, is not the same as a willful effort on behalf of members of the Trump campaign to actively collude with the Russian government. But what this latest set of indictments proves beyond a shadow of a doubt is that, yes, Russia staged an aggressive and elaborate effort to influence the 2016 election. This was a multi-pronged campaign -- social media, in-person meetings, political rallies -- by the Russians to beat Hillary Clinton and elect Donald Trump. It employed hundreds of people. That analysis, of course, jibes with the unanimous conclusion of the intelligence community in 2017 that Russia actively sought to influence the 2016 election in support of Trump. What it runs directly counter to is Trump's ongoing -- and persistent -- attempts to cast the entire special counsel investigation as nothing more than a politically motivated sideshow. \"This memo totally vindicates 'Trump' in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead).\" (2/3/18) \"The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues. There was no collusion, everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion, & yet on and on it goes. Russia & the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. Republicans should finally take control!\" (1/10/18) \"The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?\" (5/8/17) There's lots (and lots) more tweets and quotes just like that from the President. Trump has suggested the attempted election hacking could have been perpetrated by China or even as a \"guy sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds.\" You get the idea. Despite the unanimous conclusion of the intelligence community -- including Trump's CIA Director Mike Pompeo and his FBI Director Christopher Wray -- that Russia engaged in a coordinated effort to meddle in the 2017 election, Trump still wasn't convinced. Of course, this changes nothing when it comes to how Trump will respond. Even Friday afternoon, Trump tweeted about the Russian indictments , once again beating the \"no collusion\" drum. \"Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President,\" Trump tweeted. \"The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!\" But if it was very hard to hold the Trumpian position -- it might have been Russia, it might have been someone else! -- with a shred of intellectual honesty prior to Friday, it's impossible now. Consider what the Mueller investigation has already done: Former national security adviser Michael Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians during the 2016 campaign and is cooperating with the Mueller investigation. Former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians during the 2016 campaign and is cooperating with the Mueller investigation. Former deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates is reportedly on the verge of signing a plea agreement and cooperating with Mueller. Gates faces a variety of charges, including money laundering and other financial crimes. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort faces a variety of charges of financial crimes 13 Russians have been indicted on participating in a broad-scale attempt to throw the election to Trump. That is not the stuff of witch hunts and hoaxes. Those are real-life charges which carry at least the possibility of real jail time.

Pat Toomey for being \"afraid of the NRA\" due to the fact that his bipartisan gun control proposal didn't include a provision to raise the the age to certain types of guns from 18 to 21.\n\nOn Sunday night, Trump unveiled his proposal on guns in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, shooting that left 17 people dead. Guess what was left out of that proposal? Yup -- nothing on raising the age limit on the purchase of some types of weapons.\n\n\"Very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by White House. Legislation moving forward. Bump Stocks will soon be out. Highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry, subject to State Law. Armed guards OK, deterrent! On 18 to 21 Age Limits, watching court cases and rulings before acting. States are making this decision. Things are moving rapidly on this, but not much political support (to put it mildly).\"\n\nSo, the reason he didn't push to include raising the age to buy certain kinds of weapons was because he is \"watching court cases and rulings before acting\"? Or is it, as Trump goes on to note, that there is \"not much political support\" for raising the age?\n\nOn the first reason: There are suits being filed against Dick's and Walmart -- which both raised the age to buy rifles to 21 in the wake of the Parkland murders. And the NRA has sued Florida to block the part of its new law that raises the gun-buying age to 21. The NRA says that violates the 2nd and 14th Amendments.\n\nBut those suits are not necessarily a deterrent for the White House throwing its weight behind a proposal to raise the gun-buying age if it so chose. It's a bit of a smokescreen to say that pending legislation ties Trump's hands in any way. If Trump wanted to push on raising the age to buy guns, he could. The litigation is, at best, a secondary concern.\n\nWhich brings me to Trump's second point: That raising the age limit lacks public support. This is not, um, true.\n\nIn a CNN/SSRS poll conducted late last month, 71% said they supported raising the age limit to 21 to buy any sort of gun -- a proposal that goes beyond even what Trump was advocating for in the open meeting he held with members of Congress on guns earlier this month. That support is strongest among Democrats (86%) but more than six in 10 independents (67%) and Republicans (61%) also favor prohibiting gun sales to anyone under 21.\n\nWhen Trump says that raising the age limit to buy a gun lacks political support, what he is really saying is that it lacks the NRA's support -- and those within his base who view any sort of infringement on 2nd Amendment rights as beginning down a slippery slope to gun seizure.\n\nAs soon as Trump floated raising the gun-buying age, the NRA quickly came out in opposition.\n\nAnd now, this. A proposal that focuses heavily on \"hardening\" schools and arming teachers. And totally leaves out raising the age limit to buy certain firearms.\n\nThat omission is not because of pending lawsuits regarding raising the age limit. And it's definitely not because public support -- including among Republicans! -- isn't there for such a proposal.\n\nIt's because the NRA didn't want it in there. And Trump is always putting his base -- of which the NRA and single-issue 2nd Amendment voters are a big part -- first.\n\n\"I'm a fan of the NRA,\" Trump said 11 days ago. \"I mean, there's no bigger fan.

We're certainly aware of it, but we consider it to be an internal Israeli matter.\"\n\nIn Case 1000, Netanyahu is suspected of having received gifts from businessmen overseas totaling 1 million shekels (approximately $280,000), including cigars, champagne, jewelry and more, from 2007 through 2016.\n\nThe case has focused primarily on Netanyahu's relationship with Israeli billionaire and Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan.\n\nIn exchange for the gifts, police say, Netanyahu tried to advance a tax break that would have benefited Milchan, though he was blocked by the Finance Ministry.\n\n\"According to suspicions, the Prime Minister worked to advance the extension of the tax waiver for returning citizens over 10 years, a benefit that has a considerable economic value for Mr. Milchan,\" the police statement said.\n\nMK Yair Lapid, one of Netanyahu's chief rivals who served as finance minister during this period and was called to testify during the investigation, called on Netanyahu to step down. \"Even if the law does not require the Prime Minister to resign, someone who has such serious accusations against them, many of which he does not deny, cannot continue to serve as Prime Minister with responsibility for the security and well-being of Israel's citizens,\" Lapid said.\n\nPolice say they have enough evidence to indict Milchan on charges of bribery.\n\nMilchan fired back at police, insisting he and Netanyahu have been friends since long before the period under investigation.\n\n\"The recommendation disregards indisputable basic facts including -- the ties between Mr. Milchan and Mr. Netanyahu started in the early years of 2000, when Netanyahu had no government role. This connection was characterized by friendship between the two and their families. In this framework, gifts were given from time to time by Mr. Milchan to the Netanyahu family with no business interest,\" said Milchan's lawyer.\n\nIn Case 2000, police say Netanyahu discussed \"bartering\" with Arnon \"Noni\" Mozes, the owner of one of Israel's leading newspapers, Yedioth Ahronoth, which is regularly critical of the Prime Minister.\n\nIn exchange for more favorable coverage, Netanyahu promised to hamper the circulation of a rival newspaper, in recordings obtained by police.\n\n\"In his framework, what was discussed was the assistance of Mr. Mozes to Netanyahu in establishing his stature as Prime Minister through positive coverage in Yedioth Ahronoth that, in return for the Prime Minister assisting Mr. Mozes in advancing economic interests of Yedioth Ahronoth by an initiative to block the strengthening of Israel Hayom,\" the police statement said.\n\nBoth Netanyahu and Mozes have said these were not serious discussions; rather, they each claim they were trying to expose the other's lack of trustworthiness. Police say there is enough evidence to indict Mozes on charges of offering bribes.\n\nIn a statement to Israeli media, the lawyer for Mozes said, \"The cases against him will be closed.\"\n\nNetanyahu has repeatedly proclaimed his innocence, insisting that investigators will find he did nothing wrong.\n\nPolice will now pass the evidence to the attorney general, who will make a decision on whether or not to indict the Prime Minister.

The State Department official said that, \"given the long timeframes generally associated with major defense deals, the results of this effort are only beginning to become apparent.\" The Treasury Department was expected to release Monday the list of companies and individuals doing business with the Russian entities, along with two reports, all of them mandated by law. One report is expected to list wealthy Russian oligarchs with close ties to Putin, and a second is expected to outline the impact of imposing sanctions on Russia's sovereign debt. In an unclassified letter to the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Tillerson wrote that he had instructed \"all diplomatic posts\" to reach out to their host nations and make \"clear that we intended to robustly implement the law, that transactions determined to be significant were sanctionable, and that we would re-engage where necessary with more specific outreach.\" CAATSA was one of the first pieces of major legislation that Congress sent to President Donald Trump, who has refused to acknowledge fully Russia's interference and has cast doubt on the consensus opinion of US intelligence agencies that Moscow interfered in the 2016 elections. CAATSA passed with broad bipartisan support, clearing the Senate by a vote of 98-2, though Trump signed it into law reluctantly, declaring it \"seriously flawed.\" Among other things, the law limits the President's ability to remove sanctions on Russia without lawmakers' approval.

Trump has eyed Energy Secretary Rick Perry as a possible replacement, a person familiar with the matter said, though it's far from clear whether Perry is interested in moving.\n\nThe White House declined to comment Wednesday on reports of an impending administration shake-up, saying only that when Trump decides to make changes he will announce them at the time.\n\n\"There's a lot of speculation.

Trump has made known across the Cabinet that he has no tolerance for ethics scandals, and the White House held private meetings with four Cabinet-level officials -- including Carson, Shulkin, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt -- last month to scold them for embarrassing stories about questionable ethical behavior at their respective agencies, sources familiar with the sessions tell CNN.\n\nInternal watchdogs have launched at least nine audits, reviews or investigations across several Cabinet agencies, and stories about first-class travel, expensive office furniture and internal strife have become commonplace.\n\nPeople inside the West Wing believe Trump is ready to clean house.

Before firing Tillerson, Trump voiced his differences with his top diplomat on Twitter.\n\nHe hasn't openly criticized the secretaries currently embattled in ethics or other scandals, but he is fed up, people who have discussed the matter with him say.

Gates may also even be asked to go undercover.\n\nGates, 45, was Manafort's right-hand man for a decade, was privy to most, if not all, of Manafort's activities during the campaign and stayed in the Trump orbit after Manafort's exit.\n\nManafort has vowed to fight his charges and could be central to Mueller's investigation of the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, given his connection to both Trump and rich and powerful Russia-sympathetic Ukrainians. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\n\"I continue to maintain my innocence,\" Manafort said in a statement Friday after Gates' plea deal. \"I had hoped and expected my business colleague would have had the strength to continue the battle to prove our innocence. For reasons yet to surface he chose to do otherwise. This does not alter my commitment to defend myself against the untrue piled up charges contained in the indictments against me.\"\n\nLast Friday, the special counsel produced grand jury indictments for 13 Russian nationals, accusing them of operating a misinformation campaign to hurt Hillary Clinton's presidential effort. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos have already pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about their interactions with Russians and agreed to cooperate.\n\nIn court and case filings, prosecutors described an 11-year \"scheme\" in which the two longtime business partners allegedly worked together to launder tens of millions of dollars they made doing foreign lobbying work, avoid paying taxes and buoy income with fraudulently obtained loans.\n\nGates said he was guilty of helping Manafort use bank accounts in Cyprus and Grenadines to hide millions of dollars they made lobbying for Ukrainian politicians as far back as 2006.\n\nThe pair flowed $75 million through offshore accounts, and Manafort laundered $18 million to buy property and luxury goods in the US, prosecutors said. Gates transferred $3 million between accounts, court papers said.\n\nManafort also used the bank accounts to buy real estate in the US and obtain mortgages, prosecutors charge.\n\nThroughout the 45-minute plea hearing Friday in Washington, prosecutors framed Gates as an assistant in criminal activity, doing Manafort's bidding.\n\n\"Acting on the authority of Mr. Manafort, [Gates] routinely dealt with Mr. Manafort's tax accountants\" and misled them, prosecutor Greg Andres described to the judge. Manafort also lied on his foreign lobbying registrations \"with Gates' assistance,\" prosecutor Andrew Weissmann said.\n\nGates, bearded and wearing a blue suit, tie and cuff links, listened as Judge Amy Berman Jackson read the offenses he is agreeing to plead guilty to. He said, \"Yes, your honor,\" repeatedly as she read the court documents.\n\nAs he exited the hearing, Gates appeared in a lighter mood. He briefly joked with reporters about whether he may shave his beard, then walked from the courthouse to a waiting SUV through a scrum of cameras and protesters.\n\nGates has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, and they may ask the judge to reduce his sentence if they are satisfied. Gates' attorney also told the court he may argue for a reduction of the sentence because of the \"disproportionate conduct\" between Manafort and Gates.\n\nGates faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, but it's more likely his sentence will range from almost five to six years, the judge said. His charges together also carry a maximum fine of $500,000, though it's more likely his fine will range from $2,000 to $200,000, according to the judge. A hearing date for Gates' sentencing has not been set.\n\nEarlier Friday, Gates said that despite his \"initial desire to vigorously defend myself,\" he has had a \"change of heart\" in order to protect his family, according to a letter sent to his family and friends, obtained by CNN from a Gates friend.\n\n\"The reality of how long this legal process will likely take, the cost, and the circus-like atmosphere of an anticipated trial are too much,\" Gates wrote. \"I will better serve my family moving forward by exiting this process.\"\n\nThe father of four wrote that it was a \"difficult decision\" to make, but that ensuring his family's well-being \"is first and foremost.\"\n\n\"The consequence is the public humiliation, which at this moment seems like a small price to pay for what our children would have to endure otherwise,\" he said.\n\nDocument says Gates lied this month about Ukraine discussion\n\nOne new charge Friday zeroed in on a conversation Gates had with investigators earlier this month about Manafort's Ukrainian lobbying.\n\nGates lied to investigators earlier this month about a 2013 meeting in Washington attended by Manafort and others. According to the document, Gates lied when he said Ukraine was not discussed at the meeting.\n\n\"Gates had participated with Manafort in preparing a report that memorialized for Ukraine leadership the pertinent Ukraine discussions that Manafort represented had taken place at the meeting,\" the new court filing says.\n\nThat meeting, in mid-March 2013, was attended by Manafort, California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher and former Rep. Vin Weber, who is now a lobbyist with Mercury LLC, according to lobbying disclosures filed last year with the Justice Department. Rohrabacher and Weber were not identified in Friday's court filings, though their positions were referenced and the description in the court filing matches the record of the meeting in the lobbying disclosures.\n\nRohrabacher is one of the most Russia-friendly lawmakers on Capitol Hill. He regularly embraces Kremlin-aligned talking points and has forged friendly relations with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.

Since then, he has been talking to Mueller's investigators and providing information to the grand jury.\n\nNader attended a December 2016 meeting in New York between Emirati officials and members of Trump's inner circle, and another in January 2017 in the Seychelles islands between the Emiratis and Erik Prince, a Trump associate. Nader was also in the Seychelles when Prince met with a Russian banker, the sources said.\n\nThe special counsel's questions about the Emiratis point to an investigation that has expanded beyond Russian meddling in the 2016 election to broader concerns about foreign influence during the presidential campaign and long after it concluded. The Washington Post reported last week that at least four countries, including the United Arab Emirates, have discussed ways they could compromise Jared Kushner, the President's son-in-law.\n\nWhile there is no indication that Nader is suspected of wrongdoing, his knowledge of key meetings involving the Emiratis and others could be helpful to the special counsel in understanding the inner workings of the transition and possible efforts to influence key figures in the administration.\n\nNader learned for the first time when he returned to Dulles that the special counsel was interested in him and the information he had about key sessions, at least two of which he personally attended.\n\nThe FBI agents with search warrants imaged his electronic devices and then served him with a grand jury subpoena ordering him to appear January 19, according to a person familiar with Nader's involvement. An agreement was reached that Nader appear for questioning with Mueller's investigators.\n\nNader attended a meeting in the Seychelles between the Emiratis and Prince, people familiar with the session told CNN. Nader was also present at the bar when Prince met with Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive of the state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund, although it is unclear whether he was involved in the conversation, these people say.\n\nAfter the election ended, Nader maintained contact with senior administration officials, including Bannon and Kushner, according to sources familiar with the situation.\n\nThe White House, Nader's lawyer and the special counsel's office declined to comment. The Embassy for the United Arab Emirates did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNader, a 58-year-old Lebanese-American, has kept a low profile even among Middle East experts in the US.\n\n\"He is a man of mystery,\" said Frederic Hof, director of the Atlantic Council's Middle East center. \"Until this recent flurry of interest in him, I don't think I've even heard his name mentioned for 12 years.\"\n\nOne Middle East expert was stunned to hear that Nader, who travels frequently, maintained an address in Washington. Another expressed surprise at finding out Nader was still alive because he had disappeared from public view.\n\nSince the 1980s, Nader has made a habit of ingratiating himself with administrations in Washington by volunteering to open lines of communication with elusive Middle Eastern leaders. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Nader was the president and editor of a magazine called Middle East Insight. While many in his field assumed his role as a magazine editor helped him create inroads with prominent leaders abroad, they still had little insight into how he'd built such an unusual rolodex.\n\n\"He had stunningly authentic contacts,\" said Aaron David Miller, the director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Nader had prominent ties in Lebanon, Syria, Israel and Iran and, for the most part, was able to move freely within those countries, according to people who have worked with him.\n\n\"He had tremendous contacts in the Middle East in places that normal people -- at least back then, and to this day -- don't go,\" said Miller, a former adviser to six secretaries of state who encountered Nader frequently over the years.\n\nPeople who worked with him described him as low-key -- a discreet name-dropper who often volunteered his efforts as a go-between and provided credible information.\n\nDennis Ross, a fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, first encountered Nader when he was working on Middle East issues in the waning days of the Reagan administration. But he came to work with him more closely under President George H.W. Bush on an effort to free Americans who were still being held hostage in Lebanon after the Iran-Contra affair, Ross said.\n\nNader acted as a middle man between the US and Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, a Shiite cleric in Lebanon whose work inspired the founders of Hezbollah. Nader relayed Fadlallah's demands to Ross, who insisted the US wasn't going to negotiate. But the two sides kept talking.\n\n\"He was involved in discussions that ultimately led to the release of those who were being held in Lebanon,\" Ross said.\n\nNot all of his endeavors yielded success.\n\nDuring the Clinton administration, Nader was involved in another \"shadow diplomatic effort,\" this time to attempt to strike an Israeli-Syrian peace deal, Ross said. He worked alongside Ronald Lauder, a cosmetics heir who has been heavily involved in Jewish philanthropic causes, on the off-the-books effort. Nader was brought in, at least in part, because he spoke Arabic and had a relationship with Walid Muallem, at the time the Syrian ambassador to the US who went on to become Syria's foreign minister.\n\nBut it was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nFor his work over the years, Nader asked for nothing in return.\n\n\"He was presenting himself to all sides as someone who could be a kind of middleman,\" Ross said. \"I don't know if it meant he got paid by others, but he certainly wasn't paid by any of us.\"\n\nIt's unclear how Nader first came into contact with members of Trump's inner circle.\n\nThe New York meeting was unusual enough that it prompted a scramble inside the White House, where Obama administration officials saw intelligence reports on the meeting and sought to find out who the Emiratis were meeting.\n\nThe New York session occurred in December. After that discussion, Emirati officials helped set up the Seychelles meeting between Dmitriev, the head of the Russian investment fund, and Prince, a prominent Trump donor and founder of the security firm Blackwater.\n\nThe meeting's existence drew the interest of intelligence agencies from the US and the Middle East.\n\nThe meeting with Dmitriev, he said, lasted about a half hour after dinner over a beer.\n\nA spokesman for Prince said his client has no comment beyond his testimony.", "link": null, "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Zachary Cohen", "body": "Washington (CNN) Air Force One is primed to receive an upgrade that will include new refrigerators expected to cost American taxpayers nearly $24 million.\n\nThe US Air Force awarded Boeing a $23.6 million contract in December to replace two of the five \"cold chiller units\" aboard the aircraft used by President Donald Trump.\n\n\"The current rear lower lobe cold chiller units being replaced are the original commercial equipment delivered with the aircraft in 1990.

Some of the intelligence collected includes communications that sparked concerns among investigators that Manafort had encouraged the Russians to help with the campaign, three sources familiar with the investigation have told CNN. Two of these sources, however, cautioned that the evidence is not conclusive.

Gowdy's congressional tenure has been marked by central roles in high-profile investigations. The Gowdy-led House Benghazi investigation drew near constant headlines and included a focus on Clinton's email practices as secretary of state. In the fall of 2015, Clinton appeared before the committee for a daylong hearing, and as he released a report on the probe's findings, Gowdy defended the investigation and faulted the Obama administration for lapses that led to the deaths in Benghazi. Gowdy's name surfaced as a potential choice last May in the wake of Trump's decision to fire James Comey as FBI director. Gowdy took himself out of the running, and said in a statement at the time that he had told Attorney General Jeff Sessions he would not be the right choice to take over the bureau. More recently, Gowdy has both criticized the FBI's conduct during the 2016 election and defended former FBI Director Robert Mueller's stewardship of the special counsel investigation into potential coordination between Trump's associates and Russia to influence the 2016 US election. As some Trump allies have ratcheted up criticism of the special counsel, Gowdy has voiced his support for Mueller, saying last fall that he did not think Mueller should step down.

US intel chiefs unanimous that Russia is targeting 2018 elections On Tuesday, Rogers reiterated that he still views Moscow as a threat to the 2018 elections, a stance that is consistent with what he and other top national security officials told the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this month. \"We expect Russia to continue using propaganda, social media, false-flag personas, sympathetic spokesmen and other means to influence, to try to build on its wide range of operations and exacerbate social and political fissures in the United States,\" Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats previously testified. \"There should be no doubt that Russia perceives its past efforts as successful and views the 2018 US midterm elections as a potential target for Russian influence operations,\" he said.

Trump declared last week that \"the facts\" prove he's been tougher on Russia than his predecessor, President Barack Obama but it is clear that is not the case -- especially when it comes to punishing Russia for interfering in US elections. Trump says 'the facts' prove he's tougher on Russia than Obama -- they don't Trump has yet to levy a single sanction to punish Russia for election interference, despite the fact that Congress almost unanimously passed legislation that took effect on January 29 requiring him to do so, and despite senior intelligence officials testifying that Russia is trying to disrupt the 2018 midterms. Rogers clearly indicated on Tuesday that the US response to Moscow's interference in the 2016 election has been insufficient and has done little to deter ongoing attacks.

Japan's foreign minister admitted he was \"a bit surprised.\"\n\nThe famously hawkish Bolton will become part of a new trio advising and guiding Trump as he navigates unprecedented talks with North Korea, his possible departure from the Iran nuclear deal, and increased tension with Moscow and Beijing.\n\nBolton, a former State Department official and ambassador to the UN, could be joined, pending confirmation, by Gina Haspel, a career CIA officer who has been nominated to lead the agency, and the current CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who has been tapped to lead the State Department\n\nHaspel remains something of a cipher to the public, but Pompeo's tenure as a lawmaker established him as a hardliner who advocated for bombing Iran even as negotiations on the international nuclear deal were ongoing.\n\nThe world reacted with caution and some dismay.\n\nIn one quarter, there was warm praise.\n\nBut at the UN, the place where Bolton is perhaps best known because of his tenure as ambassador from 2005 to 2006, officials chose their words with extremely diplomatic care, with some issuing veiled warnings about the need to defend the institution and its cooperative, collaborative ideals.\n\nRichard Gowan, a UN analyst at Columbia University, had an explanation. \"The UN is in considerable trouble,\" Gowan said. \"Bolton does not merely dislike the UN. He knows the organization rather too well for comfort.\"\n\n\"A club for people to get together\"\n\nWith Trump already pre-disposed to dislike the UN -- he referred to it as \"just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time\" -- Gowan said Bolton could deepen cuts the Trump administration has already made to its regular budget and peacekeeping operations and perhaps go even further.\n\n\"He will likely press [US Ambassador to the UN Nikki] Haley and Pompeo to find ways to weaken the UN quite drastically and decisively,\" Gowan said, \"rather than merely trimming its budgets.\"\n\nA UN Security Council diplomat hedged on Pompeo's impact at the State Department, but added, \"an appointment of John Bolton ... that would change the question.\"\n\nUN diplomats were more careful on the record. Spokesman Stephane Dujarric, who defended the institution against some of Bolton's broadsides in 2006, said Friday that UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres \"had developed a very constructive and positive relationship\" with outgoing national security adviser H.R. McMaster. \"and he looks forward to continuing that relationship with Ambassador Bolton.\"\n\nReporters asked Dujarric to respond to some of Bolton's more pointed criticisms of the UN. The lawyer and Fox News commentator has said there's \"no such thing\" as the United Nations, that if the headquarters lost 10 stories, it wouldn't make a difference, and that it would be a mistake to grant validity to international law.\n\n\"Look, we will leave analysis of past statements to journalists and historians,\" Dujarric said. \"We're not going to speculate about the future, we're dealing with the present. And as I said, the secretary general looks forward to continuing the kind of relationship he had with the national security adviser with the new one.\"\n\nWhen asked about Bolton's appointment, Sigrid Kaag, the Netherlands' minister of foreign trade, told reporters that, \"we remained firmly anchored in multilateralism as a way to solve most burning and pertinent issues today, in the past, and in the future.\"\n\nUK Deputy Ambassador to the UN Jonathan Allen was asked if Bolton's appointment was going to test multilateralism, given his hostile views.\n\n\"The US and the UK have long been close allies and friends,\" Allen said without mentioning Bolton's name. \"That will continue and endure.\"\n\n\"This is worrisome news,\" Kim Hack-yong, a conservative South Korean lawmaker who heads his parliament's national defense committee, told Reuters.\n\nBolton's views on Pyongyang were most recently on display in a February 28 commentary that laid out what he called a \"perfectly legitimate\" case for a pre-emptive strike against North Korea. It used an example from 1837 as the basis for his justification and made no mention of the thousands of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Koreans who would die in the event of a US military attack and North Korean reprisal.\n\nKim was among many observers who worried about the repercussions if planned May talks between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un don't go well.\n\nJapanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said he was \"a bit surprised\" that former national security adviser H.R. McMaster was out, given that he'd just met him the week before in Washington. That said, Kono told the Japan Times that he didn't expect big changes given the \"complete agreement\" between Washington and Tokyo.\n\nJapan's Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yoshihide Suga, offered the Japan Times a very careful and caveated assessment. \"We have been closely exchanging views with the US government, both between leaders and at the working level, so we don't think there will be any particular negative influence.\"\n\nThere was no reaction from North Korea, which in 2003 felt free to blast Bolton as \"human scum\" and a \"bloodsucker.\"\n\nIn 2006, Bolton was working with the Security Council on North Korea resolutions after illegal missile and nuclear tests. At one meeting the North Korea representative walked out on the Council, which Bolton compared to former Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev pounding his shoe on a desk in the General Assembly when upset.\n\nMiddle Eastern reaction was clearly divided. Across the region, countries are waiting to see whether Trump will walk away from the nuclear deal with Iran on May 12, the day he has to continue to waive sanctions on Tehran or pull the IS out of the agreement. Trump has set that day as a deadline for US and European negotiators to find a way to change the deal.\n\nIn Iran, the spokesman of the powerful Guardian Council pointed to Bolton's ties with a group that opposes the government in Tehran, and said it showed Washington's continued support for terrorist groups operating against Iran. \"Now the question is why Bolton has been assumed to a sensitive position,\" he wrote in a piece for the semi-official Fars News service.\n\nThe Lebanese newspaper al-Akhbar, aligned with the Shi'ite militant group and political movement Hezbollah, used the headline \"Zionist Hawk in the White House,\" to alert readers to Bolton's new job, Reuters reported.\n\nBut in Israel, Bolton's ascension was greeted as happy news. Naftali Bennett, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet, hailed Bolton as \"an extraordinary security expert, experienced diplomat and a stalwart friend of Israel.\"", "link": null, "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Chris Cillizza", "body": "(CNN) President Donald Trump wasn't -- and, apparently, still isn't -- happy that Democrats in Congress didn't stand to applaud him in his State of the Union address last week.\n\n\"They were like death and un-American.

Last year he slammed Sessions on Twitter for taking \"a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers\" and described his as \" beleaguered \" in a tweet that asked why he wasn't \"looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?\" Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2017 Even still, Sessions has remained in the administration despite regularly drawing Trump's ire. It was clear to people Trump was speaking with over the weekend and sources with knowledge of his feelings, though, that his disdain for Sessions hasn't gone away. One person said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's televised announcement Friday of indictments against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities for allegedly meddling in the 2016 presidential election reignited Trump's anger at Sessions. \"He will never get over Sessions recusing himself,\" a person familiar with the President's thinking said. The President also has come to believe Sessions is in over his head at the Justice Department, this person says. It's unlikely, though, that Sessions is going anywhere soon, given how any confirmation battle for a new attorney general would be a protracted and deeply partisan fight. Trump and his top aides, in an attempt to protect the President and the White House from a steady stream of stories about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into election meddling, has started to fault the Obama administration for not doing enough when the former president was in control. \"He has been tougher on Russia in the first year than Obama was in eight years combined,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said during Tuesday's White House briefing. While Trump and even some Democrats have criticized the Obama administration for not speaking up enough on Russia's actions before the election, Obama did take some steps to reprimand the country. Obama confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in China in 2016, something Trump has yet to forcefully do in meetings with the Russian leader. Trump and Putin discussed election interference in Hamburg, Germany, in July 2017. Trump later said he thought the Russian leader was earnest when he denied any election meddling. Mnuchin says more Russia sanctions are coming During his last two years in office, Obama also imposed sanctions on Russian individuals and entities for election meddling, kicked out 35 Russian diplomats and closed two Kremlin compounds in the United States. Trump has yet to impose sanctions overwhelmingly passed by Congress last year and missed deadlines to identify which Russian individuals and entities would be on the sanctions list. Last month, the Trump administration decided against implementing the sanctions against Russia and instead published a list of already prominent Russian oligarchs Sanders suggested on Tuesday that more action to confront Russia was soon to be released.", "link": null, "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Dan Merica", "body": "The tweet is the latest in a series where Trump faults former President Barack Obama for not doing enough to stop Russian meddling , but the first time Trump has suggested that Sessions -- the man he picked to lead the Justice Department but has maintained a grudge against for the better part of a year -- wasn't doing enough.\n\n\"Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren't they the subject of the investigation?\" Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. \"Why didn't Obama do something about the meddling?

The effort came a day after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Chris Wray made similar entreaties to White House chief of staff John Kelly to delay a House vote on releasing the memo. The memo also faces deep opposition inside the intelligence agencies, multiple current and former intelligence officials tell CNN. The intelligence community's concern is that by revealing details of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant process, crucial elements of intel gathering will be revealed, potentially causing foreign intelligence targets to change behavior to avoid surveillance in the future. Specifically, these intelligence officials are concerned that the memo will reveal what goes into a decision to monitor targets, including what kinds of communications are targeted, and how those communications are intercepted. These intelligence officials emphasize that applications for FISA warrants would need to be based on law enforcement information as well as intelligence gathered independently by US intelligence agencies. That would include intercepted communications and would not meet the standard for approval if the applications were based largely or entirely on outside information, such as the dossier compiled by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele. Wray hints to FBI staff that coming IG report played role in McCabe departure Republican lawmakers allege that the FISA warrant obtained to monitor former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was based in large part on the dossier, and that the judge who approved the application was not made aware to what degree the dossier played a role in the FBI request. Administration officials cautioned that despite President Donald Trump's comment that he will \"100%\" release the memo , the document will be reviewed to make sure that it does not compromise sources and methods. Likely, whenever Trump sees the document, he won't see it in a vacuum. It will be accompanied by the relevant agencies weighing in on their interests and contextual underlying intelligence, if warranted.

There have been endless fictitious stories told by her, all serving to distract the public from real violations, including very serious breaches of law of many countries.\"\n\nVashukevich says she has photos of one of the Americans meeting with Deripaska, as well as more than an hour of audio recordings.\n\nBut she refuses to name the Americans.\n\nVashukevich and Kirillov told CNN they are afraid to reveal potentially compromising information, in the event they are deported back to Russia.\n\nThey have made public appeals to the US government to speak to them, but they say so far no US official has visited them in jail.\n\n\"If I was an ambassador and there was information affecting the country I love and I didn't do anything, it would be very silly,\" Vashukevich told CNN.\n\nBack outside the detention center, Pavlo Yunko, a Ukrainian-American tourist who says he paid around $400 to attend Vashukevich and Kirillov's week-long \"sex training\" course, described the predicament now facing the pair as \"a matter of life and death.\"\n\nYunko claims to have been passed a hand-written note from Kirillov shortly after his arrest, which he says he personally delivered to an official at the US Embassy in Bangkok.\n\n\"We ask you political asylim [sic] and help us and protect us as quickly as possible, because we have very important information for USA and we risk our lives very much,\" read the note.\n\n\"We have photo-video-audio of crymes [sic] of Russian government and I give them USA if you help us,\" he added.\n\nJillian Bonnardeaux, a spokesperson for the US Embassy in Bangkok, told CNN on Monday she was aware of media reports of the arrests and the letter seeking asylum, but referred inquiries to Thai law enforcement.\n\n\"We refer all inquiries about asylum and asylum procedures to the DHS,\" Bonnardeaux added, referring to the US Department of Homeland Security.\n\nDeripaska is an ex-business associate of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\nManafort, who provided investment and consulting services to Deripaska, worked for the Russian billionaire about a decade ago, according to both men.\n\nAccording to emails described to The Washington Post, Manafort, through an intermediary, offered to provide Deripaska with \"private briefings\" about the state of the Trump campaign.\n\nSpeaking to CNN, a spokesperson for Deripaska denied allegations that the billionaire received any communications regarding private briefings.\n\nManafort's spokesman told the Post that any briefing offered on the state of the campaign would have been \"routine,\" but that no briefings took place.\n\nWhile on the way to detention in Thailand, Vashukevich published a video on her Instagram account begging US journalists to help her.\n\n\"I'm ready to give you all the missing puzzle pieces, support them with videos and audios, regarding the connections of our respected lawmakers with Trump, Manafort and the rest. I know a lot. I'm waiting for your offers and I'm waiting for you in a Thai prison,\" she said.\n\nOn Monday, speaking inside the detention center, Kirillov repeated this claim, saying he had seen photos of one of the unnamed Americans meeting with Deripaska.\n\nKirillov claims he tried and failed through a friend to contact the FBI while in Dubai in February. He also says he planned to travel to the US to try to meet with US officials after the week-long \"sex training course\" he ran in Pattaya. Those plans were foiled when Thai police burst into the last session of the sex course.\n\nThe claims made by Vashukevich and Kirillov might not normally hold much water.\n\nBoth describe themselves as free sex advocates whose Instagram feeds are full of scantily clad photos of themselves cavorting with other half-naked young women.\n\nBut allegations and revelations of an affair Vashukevich made in her book \"Diary of the Seduction of a Billionaire\" gained traction thanks to an investigation by the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\n\nIn his video, Navalny revealed that the un-named oligarch in the book was Russian industrialist Oleg Deripaska. Navalny highlighted social media posts from Vashukevich showing her next to Deripaska on a yacht alongside the Russian deputy prime minister Sergey Prikhodko.\n\nAsked about Navalny's investigation, Vashukevich told CNN \"it was all correct.\"\n\nIn the Thai jail, Vashukevich and Kirillov looked uncomfortable and desperate. They said conditions were over-crowded and miserable. They relied on food brought in every other day by friends.\n\nThe lawyer representing them says she was surprised at how long it was taking to deport the jailed \"sex coaches.\"\n\n\"Normally my clients are deported in one or two days,\" said Elena Fominykh, a Russian-speaking legal advisor and private investigator based in Bangkok.\n\nThe arrests of the pair are a worrying turn for a group of Russian-speaking acolytes of Kirillov, author of books \"Life Without Panties\" and \"The Game of Master and Huntress.\"\n\nOn Monday, Ukrainian native Maria Skulbeda waited outside the detention center in the sweltering heat in the hopes of arranging an appointment to meet Kirillov and Vashukevich.\n\nThe 21-year-old Skulbeda described Kirillov as a kind of sexual revolutionary, who teaches his followers a belief system of \"freedom, sex and love\" that revolves around the art of seduction.\n\n\"I am an employee, I am a friend, I am a lover,\" said Skulbeda, of her relationship with Kirillov.\n\nDeripaska, she said, was well known within the group to be a target of seduction by Vashukevich.\n\nA spokesperson for Deripaska denied claims he was romantically involved with Vashukevich.\n\nNow, Skulbeda fears what may happen if her friends are deported to Russia.\n\n\"First, they are in danger. Second, they have information, and third, we are afraid for their lives.\"", "link": null, "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Eric Bradner", "body": "Washington (CNN) House Republicans got a stern warning Wednesday morning to take the results of a Pennsylvania congressional race as \"a wake-up call\" ahead of November's midterm elections.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan and top campaign lieutenants said at a closed-door GOP meeting that the down-to-the-wire outcome in what had been a reliably red district shows that Democratic enthusiasm is real and all incumbents need to be prepared for competitive races.\n\n\"This is a wake-up call,\" Rep. Steve Stivers of Ohio, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told GOP lawmakers gathered for the private caucus meeting. \"If you're getting outraised, this is a wake-up call. Prepare to bear down.\"\n\nHolding onto a narrow lead, Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory in the wee Wednesday morning hours as his special election match-up against Republican Rick Saccone in Pennsylvania's 18th District went down to the wire and the final absentee and provisional ballots were being counted.\n\nFor Republicans, that the race was close at all is alarming: President Donald Trump won the district by 20 percentage points in 2016, and the GOP had pulled out all the stops to prevent an embarrassing loss, including dispatching Trump to campaign there twice and spending heavily on the race.\n\nStivers told Republicans that \"our voters turned out, but you can't get outspent five to one.\"\n\nIt was a jab at Saccone's paltry fundraising: He took in just $615,000, while Lamb raised $3 million.\n\nBut outside Republican groups pumped another $10.7 million into the race -- including about $3.5 million each from the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Ryan. And the GOP still fell short in what had for years been seen as a safe district.\n\nRyan on Wednesday morning was re-emphasizing a message he's delivered GOP lawmakers for months: The tax bill, passed in December, needs to be sold aggressively -- particularly as a boost for working-class families.\n\nRepublicans in competitive races acknowledge Wednesday that Pennsylvania served as a warning.\n\n\"I don't think there's need to be alarmed, but there's certainly reason to be concerned,\" said North Dakota Rep. Kevin Cramer, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp.\n\nOklahoma Rep. Tom Cole said the message from the special election was clear. \"You better be ready and in the end you determine your own fate in these things, particularly when you're running with candidates who have run before and won in difficult circumstances,\" Cole said, noting that the most vulnerable members are the 23 Republicans in seats that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016.\n\nRepublicans also argued that Trump's visit the Saturday before the election helped Saccone make up some ground in the final days of the race.\n\n\"it was probably a little bit too little, too late,\" Illinois GOP Rep. John Shimkus told reporters. He said he thinks the President can help in some districts, but lawmakers will have to make that determination on their own.\n\n\"I think in Pennsylvania the feedback was that Trump actually closed the gap for Saccone by coming in, so there was a feeling that there was going to be a bigger deficit for Saccone than there may have been, but it's probably different district by district,\" said Ohio Rep. Warren Davidson.\n\nSeveral Republicans indicated that Ryan and other leaders gave a clear message that members can't be outraised by challengers and they need to work harder to have a financial advantage in a challenging political climate.\n\n\"Money is something you can make up pretty quickly, particularly if you are an incumbent and it's a competitive seat,\" Cole said.\n\nBut GOP lawmakers criticized their own candidate, Saccone, for not raising enough money and failing to take control of the narrative in the race.\n\n\"You've got to control your own destiny and he didn't,\" Shimkus said.\n\nShimkus pointed to the financial gap in the two campaigns as the reason why Saccone couldn't use the tax bill as an effective issue because he let outside groups and Lamb define who he was.\n\n\"He couldn't do the positive message because he didn't have the money,\" Shimkus said.\n\nLamb said on the campaign trail that he'd oppose House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, for speaker. But that didn't seem to diminish Pelosi's happiness over the outcome in a district where Democrats have been blown out in recent elections.\n\n\"It's exciting. It's very exciting,\" Pelosi said as she walked into a Democratic caucus meeting Wednesday morning. \"This goes to show you this election is about the people of western Pennsylvania.

Un-American. Somebody said, 'Treasonous.' I mean, yeah, I guess, why not,\" Trump said to laughter during a speech outside Cincinnati, Ohio on Monday.

We all know that,\" then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in 2017. Trump himself looked to calm the controversy following the comments by claiming he was being \"sarcastic.\" In 2017, White House aides maintained that Trump wasn't being serious when he said law enforcement officials should not \"be too nice\" to suspects in custody. \"When you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over?\" Trump said during a speech to law enforcement on Long Island, New York. \"Like, don't hit their head, and they just killed somebody -- don't hit their head. I said, you can take the hand away, OK?\" Sanders said he was \" making a joke at the time .\" And in response to Trump claiming that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson should take an IQ test to see which of the two men is smarter, Sanders said Trump \" made a joke, nothing more than that .\" \"The President certainly never implied that the secretary of state was not incredibly intelligent. He made a joke, nothing more than that,\" said Sanders. \"He has full confidence in the secretary of state. They had a great visit earlier today.

It's disgraceful,\" Trump told reporters, delivering a sudden shock to the global economy by saying he would unveil tariffs next week of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum. He further stoked fears of world turmoil Friday morning, tweeting that \"trade wars are good\" when the US is losing billions in overseas deals.\n\nWhen a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don't trade anymore-we win big. It's easy!\n\nWorld powers now know what it's been like for Trump's fellow Republicans and staff in a week of turmoil and neck-jerking policy pivots that have left them groping for clarity and trying to work out exactly where the President stands.\n\nAt home, stocks crashed on the President's offhanded announcement, while GOP leaders, stung by a second straight day of Trump trampling party orthodoxy after his surreal meeting Wednesday on guns , registered dissent and frustration.\n\n\"We were told at the beginning of all this that Donald Trump was comfortable with chaos -- that's how he is accustomed to operate,\" David Axelrod, a former Obama administration top strategist, said on CNN's \"The Situation Room.\"\n\n\"That may be OK if you are running a small family branding business, but when you are in the most important office on the planet it can have grave consequences,\" Axelrod said.\n\nGiven the on-again-off-again nature of Thursday's announcement and subsequent lack of details, there was more than a suspicion that the trade move had been fast-tracked to distract from a disastrous week.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders denied the President was trying to divert attention from all that with his trade announcement, saying it was hardly news that Trump thinks global commerce, particularly as practiced by nations like China, cheats American workers.\n\n\"The President is concerned about the men and women of this country who have been forgotten about, the industries that our country was founded and built on. And this shouldn't come as a surprise to anybody,\" she said.\n\nEven so, Thursday's move, which is likely to spark follow-on turmoil in Asian and European markets, offered a glimpse of how an erratic President looking for diversions amid deepening crises could act in ways that jolt global stability.\n\nGiven that the turmoil surrounding Trump seems to spin more out of control by the day, the world could be in for a rough ride in the coming months.\n\nStill, while much of the Washington and global establishment will be bracing for more, Trump supporters are unlikely to be fazed, since his unpredictability and disdain for long-held conventions and behavioral codes are exactly why they voted for him as they looked for someone willing to shake things up.\n\nBut anyone who is not in his famously loyal voting base may beg to differ.\n\nThursday was not the first time that Trump's determination to honor his populist, nationalist campaign rhetoric had sent shock waves around the globe. It helped drive his decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord and repeated efforts to sink the Iran nuclear deal brokered by President Barack Obama, both of which caused panic and consternation abroad.\n\nThe drama was also typical of the unpredictable, often unspecific style of leadership that appears often to skirt over the possible consequences of Trump's tendency to trust his instincts.\n\nThere was not much sign, for instance, that the White House had gamed out the reactions of trading partners to the new tariffs and the risk of a trade war and damage to key alliances that they could provoke.\n\nA trade war could well destabilize the global economy and have consequences for the President's political fortunes if US stocks and growth take a hit from reprisals by foreign powers, in sectors other than steel and aluminum.\n\nMolson Coors, for instance, warned that tariffs on aluminum could push up the cost of beer in cans and cause jobs to be lost.\n\n\"There will be retaliation, there will be a response and I think it is extremely unfortunate,\" Carlos Gutierrez, who served as commerce secretary under President George W. Bush, said on CNN International. \"This is most likely going to be a self-inflicted wound that will go on for a while.\"\n\nPlaying several moves ahead has not been one of Trump's strengths as President. Had he done so as he was staffing his administration, he might have concluded it was perhaps unwise to invite his family and their tangled business ties into the West Wing, a decision that has now landed him multiple ethical troubles.\n\nUS allies like Britain and Canada registered alarm at Trump's trade move, balking especially at the White House's rationale that their steel imports threatened US national security.\n\nBut foreign officials, just like those in Washington, struggled to work out exactly what Trump means to do.\n\n\"As a key NORAD and NATO ally, and as the number one customer of American steel, Canada would view any trade restrictions on Canadian steel and aluminum as absolutely unacceptable,\" Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said, promising retaliation if Trump goes ahead.\n\nBritain was mostly puzzled: CNN's Jim Acosta reported that a UK government spokesman said, \"We are engaging with the US on what this announcement means in practice.\"\n\nThose reactions mirrored the indignation and mystification painted on the faces of GOP senators who sat through the President's freewheeling, contradictory session on gun reform at the White House on Wednesday.\n\nThe lack of detail and planning seems endemic to a presidency that revolves around impulsive tweets and off-the-cuff comments by a President who has said he likes to keep everyone off balance like a negotiator in a real estate deal.\n\nA White House official, for instance, told CNN's Dan Merica that a planned announcement on steps Trump will take to respond to the Florida school massacre was postponed while officials distill a coherent policy plan from the meeting.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/02/politics/donald-trump-chaos-world-tariff-steel-aluminum/index.html", "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "", "body": "While meeting with Saudi Arabia's crown prince, President Donald Trump said he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone and that they will be meeting soon.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/03/20/trump-putin-meet-soon-sot.cnn", "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Devan Cole", "body": "Sen.

In the indictment, prosecutors described a \"scheme\" in which the two longtime business partners allegedly laundered $30 million, failed to pay taxes for almost 10 years and used real estate they owned to fraudulently secure more than $20 million in loans.\n\nAlready, the pair faced a combined 12 criminal charges in federal court in Washington, DC, for alleged money laundering and failing to disclose banking information and foreign lobbying work they did prior to 2015. A handful of Thursday's charges are also connected to the charges related to offshore accounts in the previous indictment.\n\nManafort and Gates pleaded not guilty to the charges they face in DC in October.

Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc,\" Trump wrote. \"Isn't the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!\"\n\nWhy is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn't the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!\n\nResponding to Trump's tweet, the attorney general said in a statement that the Justice Department \"initiated the appropriate process that will ensure complaints against this department will be fully and fairly acted upon if necessary.\"\n\n\"As long as I am the attorney general, I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor, and this department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and Constitution,\" Sessions said.\n\nSessions, appearing at a news conference announcing a new opioid task force, was asked about House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes' controversial memo outlining purported surveillance abuses and told reporters that \"the inspector general will take that as one of the matters he'll deal with.\"\n\nWhile Trump is correct that Horowitz does not have prosecutorial powers, he can -- and often does -- make criminal referrals to the Justice Department based on his investigations. An investigation into improper FISA use would fall squarely onto Horowitz, too, given his charge instructs him to \"investigate alleged violations of criminal and civil laws by DOJ employee.\"\n\nSessions chose to respond to the President because his latest jab was more \"in the weeds\" and about process, said a source familiar with Sessions' thinking.\n\nPrevious times, Trump has insulted Sessions when calling for the investigation of Hillary Clinton, but this time he called for Sessions to go after Justice Department attorneys, which was a bridge too far, said the source.\n\n\"There is a process, we are following that process,\" the source added.\n\nAs Sessions left the Billy Graham event in the Capitol on Wednesday, CNN asked for his response to Trump's tweet and criticism of him.\n\n\"I'm not commenting on that this morning. Thank you,\" he responded.\n\nAsked if he has discussed the criticism directly with the President, Sessions just said, \"Thanks.\"\n\nTrump's scathing tweet is the latest in a long line of public rebukes the President has leveled against his attorney general, a man who broke with much of his party to endorse Trump early in his presidential run.\n\nTrump's anger toward Sessions stems from his decision to recuse himself from all investigations into the 2016 campaign, including special counsel Robert Mueller's expanding investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives bent on meddling in the election. Sessions made that decision after he did not fully answer questions during his confirmation hearing about his conversations with Russian diplomats during the 2016 campaign. Trump, in turn, has said he wouldn't have named Sessions to lead the Justice Department had he known he would have recused himself.\n\nThat animosity has played out publicly ever since.\n\nAs pressure mounted on Sessions last year, his standing in the administration appeared untenable to people inside the West Wing. During the first six months of Trump's presidency, Trump asked for Sessions' resignation, called the attorney general an \"idiot\" but then later declined to accept his attorney general's resignation letter.\n\nSessions has so far weathered the incessant incoming from the White House and sources close to the attorney general have told CNN that he is unlikely to go anywhere soon. But the saga between the two top Republicans has played out in public for much of Trump's first year in office and the President's chronic antipathy towards the top law enforcement official has defined Trump's view of the Justice Department.\n\nThe latest chapter in the saga between Trump and Sessions came just one week ago, when Trump challenged Sessions to launch an investigation into the Obama administration for failing to do enough to stop the 2016 election foreign interference.", "link": null, "source": "CNN", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Kevin Liptak", "body": "It was Trump's most forceful attempt to date at dissuading Russia from continuing its election interference efforts, though he again suggested that other countries may have been involved and continued to insist the final results were not affected by Moscow.\n\nThe President said it was important to guard against meddling efforts during the midterm contests.\n\n\"I think you have to be really watching very closely. We won't allow that to happen,\" Trump said. \"We're doing a very, very deep study and we're coming out with, I think, some very strong suggestions on the '18 election.\"\n\nThe President has consistently shrugged off intelligence assessments that Moscow attempted to sway the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton. He's called the investigation into the interference, led by special counsel Robert Mueller, a \"hoax.\" And he's said he takes Russian President Vladimir Putin at his word when he denies having ordered the meddling campaign. That approach has worried some lawmakers, who say the administration isn't doing enough to prevent election interference in the future. A week ago, Adm. Mike Rogers -- director of the National Security Agency and Cyber Command chief -- told a congressional panel that he has not been granted the authority by Trump to disrupt Russian election hacking operations where they originate. \"It has not changed the calculus or the behavior on behalf of the Russians,\" Rogers said about the US response to Russia's cyber threat to date. This week, it was revealed the US State Department has yet to use tens of millions of dollars in funding that lawmakers allocated to counter Russian misinformation and propaganda, even as intelligence chiefs have warned that Russia is actively targeting the 2018 midterm elections. But on Tuesday, US Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said there are ongoing conversations between Trump and appropriate US agencies about how to counter the threat of Russian attacks on the midterm elections. \"It is a whole of government approach, I have discussed it personally with the President of the United States and he has said I assume you are doing your jobs,\" Coats said. Asked by a Swedish journalist whether he was concerned Russia could have an effect on the midterms, Trump insisted during his news conference that the US would prevent any election interference efforts. \"No, because we'll counteract whatever they do,\" he said. He encouraged states to include an analog backup to avoid attempts to hack electronic systems. \"You have to be very vigilant. One of the things we're learning, it's always good to have a paper backup system of voting. Called paper. Not highly complex computers.
