But, as Reynolds told Fox News, not insurmountable.\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              It\u2019s been done before, but long ago.\u00a0For example, Vermont split from New York in 1791, Maine split from Massachusetts in 1820, and West Virginia split from Virginia during the Civil War in 1863.\u00a0There haven\u2019t been any states formed by secession in modern U.S. history.\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              What\u2019s more, Americans seem to have gotten used to the idea of 50 states, with Hawaii the last admitted to the Union in 1959.\u00a0As Reynolds points out, \u201cfor most of the country\u2019s history we added a new state every couple of decades...now we act as if 50 is set in stone.\u00a0There\u2019s a plausible argument that we would be better off with more states.\u00a0It would be more representative.\u201d\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              While it would seem that state leaders wouldn\u2019t want to give up power, Reynolds offers a scenario where politicians might greet the formation of a new entity. \u201cIf you\u2019re a California politician, you spend a lot of time trying to fight your way to the top.\u00a0And the trouble is it\u2019s a really big state\u2014there are a lot of other people trying to fight their way to the top...[If the state splits, there\u2019s] a smaller pond, but you\u2019re a big fish.\u201d\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              More important than forming new states, however, Reynolds feels we should address the disputes that make citizens support secession.\u00a0 Part of the problem, he believes, goes back to the Supreme Court case \u201cReynolds v. Sims\u201d (1964), which declared state legislatures (as opposed to the U.S. Senate) have to be apportioned according to population, not geographical area. As Reynolds explains, \u201cunder the old system, rural areas got more representation, and under the new system they got much less.\u201d\u00a0 This has helped lead to the present-day situation where rural areas feel underserved.\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              Reynolds hopes there can be less dramatic solutions than secession, such as Congressional statutes (or in some cases executive orders) to ease the pressure. Reynolds thinks they have the Constitutional authority to remedy the situation, particularly under the Guarantee Clause, which states \u201cThe United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.\u201d\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              Reynolds points to civil rights laws, passed to protect unfairly treated minorities, as a model for how Congress might take action.\u00a0 He notes \u201cmost federal laws...are written to leave states the power to make stricter regulations, but if it seems like the burden...is falling disproportionately on a minority in a state that has no real political power...then I think it\u2019s fair for the federal government to step in and protect them.\u201d To Reynolds, this could mean laws limiting how far states can go regarding \u201cthe environment, firearms, wages and...things that people in rural areas are unhappy about.\u201d\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              This may seem like extreme intervention to some, but it\u2019s a lot less extreme than secession.\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              As Reynolds puts it, \u201cwhen you have people talking about wanting to split from their state, and form a new one, there\u2019s obviously some significant unhappiness, and if we can do things that are relatively low cost...to remedy it, I think probably we should.\u00a0 At least we should think about it.\u201d", "link": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/19/are-some-states-headed-for-splitsville-movement-grows-to-allow-sections-states-to-break-away.html", "source": "Fox News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Steve Kurtz", "body": "New secession movements in California, and elsewhere in America, are getting genuine attention from political pundits.\n                                    \n                                        \u00a0(newcaliforniastate.com)\n                                    \n                                \n\n                            \n\n                        \n                \t\n\n            \n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n       \n       \n      \n          \n              When Donald Trump was elected, a lot of people in California signed a petition supporting the state\u2019s secession from the U.S. It was hard to take the movement seriously\u2014didn\u2019t we fight a war over this?\n\n              \n                  \n                  \n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              But there is another secession movement in California, and elsewhere in America, that is getting genuine attention from political pundits.\u00a0While it may be unlikely to succeed, the idea of intra-state secession\u2014a section of a state splitting off to form its own state\u2014has been growing in popularity.\u00a0And there\u2019s even a Constitutional procedure for doing it.\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              In recent decades, the political differences between rural areas and metropolitan areas seem to have become more severe.\u00a0This has caused political splits in certain states, where, often, those rural areas, with lower populations, feel stifled by their city brethren.\n\n              \n             \n                           \t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n              \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              As Joel Kotkin, a fellow at Chapman University in Orange, Calif. and author of The Human City: Urbanism ForThe Rest Of Us, tells Fox News, \u201cThe worst thing in the world to be is the red part of a blue state.\u201d\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              He looks at his home state of California and sees numerous clashes between the coastal cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles, and the more conservative counties in the interior.

But, as Reynolds told Fox News, not insurmountable.\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              It\u2019s been done before, but long ago.\u00a0For example, Vermont split from New York in 1791, Maine split from Massachusetts in 1820, and West Virginia split from Virginia during the Civil War in 1863.\u00a0There haven\u2019t been any states formed by secession in modern U.S. history.\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              What\u2019s more, Americans seem to have gotten used to the idea of 50 states, with Hawaii the last admitted to the Union in 1959.\u00a0As Reynolds points out, \u201cfor most of the country\u2019s history we added a new state every couple of decades...now we act as if 50 is set in stone.\u00a0There\u2019s a plausible argument that we would be better off with more states.\u00a0It would be more representative.\u201d\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              While it would seem that state leaders wouldn\u2019t want to give up power, Reynolds offers a scenario where politicians might greet the formation of a new entity. \u201cIf you\u2019re a California politician, you spend a lot of time trying to fight your way to the top.\u00a0And the trouble is it\u2019s a really big state\u2014there are a lot of other people trying to fight their way to the top...[If the state splits, there\u2019s] a smaller pond, but you\u2019re a big fish.\u201d\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              More important than forming new states, however, Reynolds feels we should address the disputes that make citizens support secession.\u00a0 Part of the problem, he believes, goes back to the Supreme Court case \u201cReynolds v. Sims\u201d (1964), which declared state legislatures (as opposed to the U.S. Senate) have to be apportioned according to population, not geographical area. As Reynolds explains, \u201cunder the old system, rural areas got more representation, and under the new system they got much less.\u201d\u00a0 This has helped lead to the present-day situation where rural areas feel underserved.\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              Reynolds hopes there can be less dramatic solutions than secession, such as Congressional statutes (or in some cases executive orders) to ease the pressure. Reynolds thinks they have the Constitutional authority to remedy the situation, particularly under the Guarantee Clause, which states \u201cThe United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.\u201d\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              Reynolds points to civil rights laws, passed to protect unfairly treated minorities, as a model for how Congress might take action.\u00a0 He notes \u201cmost federal laws...are written to leave states the power to make stricter regulations, but if it seems like the burden...is falling disproportionately on a minority in a state that has no real political power...then I think it\u2019s fair for the federal government to step in and protect them.\u201d To Reynolds, this could mean laws limiting how far states can go regarding \u201cthe environment, firearms, wages and...things that people in rural areas are unhappy about.\u201d\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              This may seem like extreme intervention to some, but it\u2019s a lot less extreme than secession.\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              As Reynolds puts it, \u201cwhen you have people talking about wanting to split from their state, and form a new one, there\u2019s obviously some significant unhappiness, and if we can do things that are relatively low cost...to remedy it, I think probably we should.\u00a0 At least we should think about it.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Fox News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Benjamin Brown", "body": "Fox News politics editor Chris Stirewalt on the House of Representatives passing a $1.3 trillion spending bill and why Democrats support the bill.\n\n\t                        \t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t  \n\n              \n\n            \n\t\t \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n       \n       \n      \n          \n              In a vote just after midnight Friday, the Senate voted to pass a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill, averting a government shutdown while paving the way for the next funding fight ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n              \n                  \n                  \n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              The House had approved its version Thursday in a bipartisan tally of 256-167.

For that matter, there\u2019s Chicago against downstate Illinois, and New York City versus upstate New York.\u00a0 And the policy divisions are not just economic, but often traditional versus progressive politics regarding issues such as marijuana, gun control and the environment.\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              This is why there\u2019s a movement in New York for upstate to split from downstate.\u00a0 As Republican state senator Joseph Robach puts it, \u201cWe\u2019re completely overwhelmed...by the policies of New York City.\u201d In 2009 and 2011 he introduced bills to hold a referendum on secession.\u00a0 And in 2015 there was a rally in favor of carving out a new state, supported by more than a dozen groups frustrated by the policies of Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo.\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              All this secession talk has captured the notice of University of Tennessee law professor Glenn Reynolds, who recently put out a new paper, \u201cSplitsylvania: State Secession and What to Do About It.\u201d\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              He notes that Article IV, section 3 of the Constitution allows for new states to be admitted into the union, though no new state can be formed within an old state without the consent of the state legislature as well as Congress.\u00a0That\u2019s a pretty high hurdle.

Sims\u201d (1964), which declared state legislatures (as opposed to the U.S. Senate) have to be apportioned according to population, not geographical area. As Reynolds explains, \u201cunder the old system, rural areas got more representation, and under the new system they got much less.\u201d\u00a0 This has helped lead to the present-day situation where rural areas feel underserved.\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              Reynolds hopes there can be less dramatic solutions than secession, such as Congressional statutes (or in some cases executive orders) to ease the pressure.

Other plans have California splitting into three states, or even six.\u00a0It should be noted that these new states would still be bigger than many on the East Coast, and more populous than many in the West.\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              Kotkin feels this movement is driven by policies like the $15 minimum wage, \u201cwhich makes sense in San Francisco, but doesn\u2019t make sense in Fresno.\u201d\u00a0 He adds those running California are \u201cfundamentally authoritarian\u201d with \u201cnot a lot of tolerance for any kind of economic or political diversity.\u201d As he puts it, their attitude is \u201c\u2019We know the truth, we know what\u2019s right, and it has to apply to everyone.\u201d\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n                  \n              \n          \n              Kotkin further notes it\u2019s not just California where this blue versus red battle is brewing, but up the West Coast, where eastern Oregon battles against the policies of Portland, and eastern Washington against Seattle. For that matter, there\u2019s Chicago against downstate Illinois, and New York City versus upstate New York.\u00a0 And the policy divisions are not just economic, but often traditional versus progressive politics regarding issues such as marijuana, gun control and the environment.\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              This is why there\u2019s a movement in New York for upstate to split from downstate.\u00a0 As Republican state senator Joseph Robach puts it, \u201cWe\u2019re completely overwhelmed...by the policies of New York City.\u201d In 2009 and 2011 he introduced bills to hold a referendum on secession.\u00a0 And in 2015 there was a rally in favor of carving out a new state, supported by more than a dozen groups frustrated by the policies of Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo.\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              All this secession talk has captured the notice of University of Tennessee law professor Glenn Reynolds, who recently put out a new paper, \u201cSplitsylvania: State Secession and What to Do About It.\u201d\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              He notes that Article IV, section 3 of the Constitution allows for new states to be admitted into the union, though no new state can be formed within an old state without the consent of the state legislature as well as Congress.\u00a0That\u2019s a pretty high hurdle. But, as Reynolds told Fox News, not insurmountable.\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              It\u2019s been done before, but long ago.\u00a0For example, Vermont split from New York in 1791, Maine split from Massachusetts in 1820, and West Virginia split from Virginia during the Civil War in 1863.\u00a0There haven\u2019t been any states formed by secession in modern U.S. history.\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              What\u2019s more, Americans seem to have gotten used to the idea of 50 states, with Hawaii the last admitted to the Union in 1959.\u00a0As Reynolds points out, \u201cfor most of the country\u2019s history we added a new state every couple of decades...now we act as if 50 is set in stone.\u00a0There\u2019s a plausible argument that we would be better off with more states.\u00a0It would be more representative.\u201d\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              While it would seem that state leaders wouldn\u2019t want to give up power, Reynolds offers a scenario where politicians might greet the formation of a new entity. \u201cIf you\u2019re a California politician, you spend a lot of time trying to fight your way to the top.\u00a0And the trouble is it\u2019s a really big state\u2014there are a lot of other people trying to fight their way to the top...[If the state splits, there\u2019s] a smaller pond, but you\u2019re a big fish.\u201d\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              More important than forming new states, however, Reynolds feels we should address the disputes that make citizens support secession.\u00a0 Part of the problem, he believes, goes back to the Supreme Court case \u201cReynolds v. Sims\u201d (1964), which declared state legislatures (as opposed to the U.S. Senate) have to be apportioned according to population, not geographical area. As Reynolds explains, \u201cunder the old system, rural areas got more representation, and under the new system they got much less.\u201d\u00a0 This has helped lead to the present-day situation where rural areas feel underserved.\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              Reynolds hopes there can be less dramatic solutions than secession, such as Congressional statutes (or in some cases executive orders) to ease the pressure. Reynolds thinks they have the Constitutional authority to remedy the situation, particularly under the Guarantee Clause, which states \u201cThe United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.\u201d\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              Reynolds points to civil rights laws, passed to protect unfairly treated minorities, as a model for how Congress might take action.\u00a0 He notes \u201cmost federal laws...are written to leave states the power to make stricter regulations, but if it seems like the burden...is falling disproportionately on a minority in a state that has no real political power...then I think it\u2019s fair for the federal government to step in and protect them.\u201d To Reynolds, this could mean laws limiting how far states can go regarding \u201cthe environment, firearms, wages and...things that people in rural areas are unhappy about.\u201d\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              This may seem like extreme intervention to some, but it\u2019s a lot less extreme than secession.\n\n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              As Reynolds puts it, \u201cwhen you have people talking about wanting to split from their state, and form a new one, there\u2019s obviously some significant unhappiness, and if we can do things that are relatively low cost...to remedy it, I think probably we should.\u00a0 At least we should think about it.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Fox News", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Benjamin Brown", "body": "Fox News politics editor Chris Stirewalt on the House of Representatives passing a $1.3 trillion spending bill and why Democrats support the bill.\n\n\t                        \t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t  \n\n              \n\n            \n\t\t \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n       \n       \n      \n          \n              In a vote just after midnight Friday, the Senate voted to pass a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill, averting a government shutdown while paving the way for the next funding fight ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n              \n                  \n                  \n              \n             \n               \n              \n              \n              \n\n\n              \n          \n              The House had approved its version Thursday in a bipartisan tally of 256-167.
