[{"author": "Ella Nilsen", "body": "In a stunning upset, Democrat Conor Lamb won an incredibly close special election in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District, beating out Republican candidate Rick Saccone in a deeply conservative district the nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates R+11.\n\nThe race stretched into Wednesday midday, when CNN said Lamb was in the lead with 627 votes, with 100 percent of precincts reporting. State law does not mandate a recount in district-level elections. \n\n\nConventional wisdom suggested that Saccone \u2014 a candidate who once declared himself \u201cTrump before Trump was Trump\u201d \u2014 would do well in a district that turned out in droves for President Donald Trump in 2016. But in recent weeks, Republicans were in full panic mode, dumping over $9 million into the race. Lamb\u2019s victory shows they were right to be so worried. \n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just Republicans who feared losing this district, it was Trump himself.\n\nIn many ways, PA-18 was emblematic of Trump\u2019s presidential success story; the president carried the district by 20 points in 2016, along with much of the rest of Western Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania was one of the blue-collar Rust Belt states he was never supposed to win, but won anyway, in a stunning rebuke to Hillary Clinton. \n\nAlong with Wisconsin and Michigan, the Keystone state carried Trump to victory on Election Day 2016. It\u2019s a story Trump often recounts at rallies, including the one he held for Saccone in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, on Saturday.\n\nVoting for Saccone is exactly what the president wanted his supporters to do. Trump cared enough about Saccone winning to join him on the campaign trail multiple times and send Vice President Mike Pence and members of his family, including son Donald Trump Jr. and daughter Ivanka Trump, to stump. \n\nHe even pushed a controversial announcement on steel and aluminum import tariffs to land a week before the special election. \n\nNone of it worked.\n\nTrump voters ended up either staying home, or proving they could just as easily cast their votes for a Democrat with the right message, especially when Trump wasn\u2019t the candidate on the ballot.\n\nConor Lamb won a district Democrats weren\u2019t supposed to be competitive in\nOn its face, Tuesday\u2019s special congressional election in the southwest corner of Pennsylvania was supposed to be a breeze for the GOP. The Cook Political Report rates the district R+11 (due in part to partisan gerrymandering that the state Supreme Court recently ruled unconstitutional).\n\nPolitical analysts in the state agreed that the district\u2019s gerrymandering was part of the reason it was supposed to be impossible for Democrats to win. This is a seat that used to be so solidly Republican, Democrats didn\u2019t even both competing in it. \n\nThe newly open seat was held by former Rep. Tim Murphy (R-PA) since 2003, who was so secure in his seat that he often failed to attract a Democratic challenger. Murphy suddenly resigned in October amid revelations that he had pressured a woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair to have an abortion. But even after he stepped down, national Democrats didn\u2019t think they could compete in the special election, one Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee operative told Vox.\n\nThat was, until Conor Lamb came along.\n\nA 33-year-old Marine and former assistant US attorney who prosecuted drug dealers in the midst of Pennsylvania\u2019s deadly opioid crisis, Lamb comes from a well-known political family in Pittsburgh, but is new to politics himself. \n\nHe has struck a decidedly independent tone throughout the campaign, making headlines when he said he would not support House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi as the Democratic leader if a blue wave sweeps the House in 2018, echoing his support for the 2nd Amendment, and telling voters he personally doesn\u2019t believe in abortion (though he supports Roe v. Wade as the law of the land).\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got local ties; he\u2019s a local guy,\u201d Tim Waters, political director for the United Steelworkers Political Action Committee told Vox. \u201cHe\u2019s a young guy with a lot of energy ... right down the line on issues that affect workers in this district.\u201d\n\nLamb\u2019s independent streak has also made it difficult for Republicans to attack him as a politician in step with Pelosi, although they\u2019ve certainly tried to. Republicans and conservative groups have mostly been trying to tie Lamb to the Democratic agenda.\n\nBut throughout the campaign, there was not a lot of evidence it was sticking. \n\nFocused almost exclusively on local issues, Lamb has nevertheless stumbled into a long-running debate about how the Democratic Party can claw its way back to the majority after 2016.\n\nTrying to recapture blue-collar workers, Lamb\u2019s campaign represents one school of thought \u2014 going back to labor-liberal economic values and working with unions to retake territory in Midwest and Rust Belt states that voted for Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nTrump and Lamb actually campaigned on many of the same core issues\nPA-18 is often characterized as a conservative district, but it has deep Democratic roots as well. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much a conservative district as it is an economic populist district,\u201d said longtime Pennsylvania Democratic consultant Mike Mikus. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to support the NRA down the line, but respect the right of people to own firearms ... and [be] someone that\u2019s willing to stand up to the national party when they feel it\u2019s in the interest of the district or the region.\u201d\n\nThere are technically 70,000 more registered Democrats in the 18th Congressional District than Republicans, but many of those voters have been casting ballots for GOP candidates for years. Mikus, who has worked on Democratic campaigns in the state for years, said Lamb successfully proved himself an independent.\n\n\u201cConor, I think so far, has done a fairly good job as portraying himself as someone that\u2019s going to fight for the region,\u201d Mikus said. \n\nLamb\u2019s campaign was not against Trump; the former federal prosecutor rarely mentioned the president at his events, instead focusing on issues like protecting entitlements like Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare, and ending Pennsylvania\u2019s opioid crisis \u2014 which Gov. Tom Wolf recently declared a state of emergency.\n\nIn other words \u2014 many of the same themes Trump echoed during his 2016 presidential campaign. \n\nFrom the beginning of his campaign, Trump vowed not to cut entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. Then, when he got into office, his 2019 budget proposed cutting Medicare by $236 billion over 10 years (those cuts have not been enacted). \n\nTrump promised many times to end the opioid crisis that\u2019s ravaging Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and other Rust Belt states and that in 2016 claimed more lives than the entire Vietnam War. \n\nThe president\u2019s response has been to declare the opioid epidemic a public health emergency, but little else. The administration has largely ignored the recommendations of Trump\u2019s opioids commission, Trump has twice tried to strip his Office of National Drug Control Policy of funding, and proposed a death penalty for drug dealers. Congress recently appropriated $6 billion for treatment, which experts say falls dramatically short of what\u2019s needed. \n\nEven so, Trump has remained relatively popular in the district. Saccone was unable to replicate that popularity for himself.\n\nThis special election was personal for Donald Trump\nAll special elections so far have been declared a referendum on Trump by pollsters and the media. But Pennsylvania is arguably one of the few the president actually cared about because the state was one of his greatest 2016 success stories.\n\nTrump won Pennsylvania by a little over 73,000 votes, 48.2 percent to Clinton\u2019s 47.5 percent. The roughly one-point percentage that separated the two candidates was seismic; it delivered Trump 20 electoral college votes and was part of the Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania trifecta that pushed him to the presidency. \n\nTrump was never supposed to win Pennsylvania; the fact he claimed the state in 2016 became an integral part of his narrative, one that he repeated at the Saturday Saccone rally.\n\n\u201cOn November 8, Pennsylvania is the state that gave us the 45th president of the United States,\u201d Trump said, as the crowd cheered.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re one of us!\u201d one crowd member yelled.\n\n\u201cThey said we couldn\u2019t get elected,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cI say we ... because some of you had never voted before, but you love the country. Remember, they said, \u2018You cannot win.\u2019 Remember the famous 270? Remember, they said he cannot get to 270. And we didn\u2019t, we got to 306.\u201d\n\nFor Republicans, there was a mad dash to pour cash into the race so they didn\u2019t embarrass themselves by losing a district that Democrats were never even supposed to be competitive in. But for Trump, the impetus was much more personal. \n\nTrump\u2019s push wasn\u2019t about Saccone, it was about hanging onto \u201cTrump country\u201d in Southwestern Pennsylvania \u2014 and with it, the very narrative that put him in the White House. For the president, who prizes loyalty, this race was the ultimate test. \n\n\u201cNormally I would not come, except it\u2019s Pennsylvania,\u201d Trump said on Saturday. \u201cI love Pennsylvania.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Umair Irfan", "body": "The $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill that needs to pass this week to avert a government shutdown increases spending on clean energy and keeps the Environmental Protection Agency funded at current levels.\n\nThat\u2019s despite the White House suggestion that Congress cut EPA\u2019s budget by one-third and make drastic reductions in clean energy research. \n\nTarak Shah, a former chief of staff  in the science and energy office at the US Department of Energy, told Vox the bill was an \u201cutter repudiation of the Trump budget!\u201d\n\nThe EPA will keep its $8.1 billion budget with a few changes, including $66 million allocated toward the Superfund program for cleaning up highly contaminated sites.\n\nThe Department of Energy\u2019s high-risk, high-reward research incubator, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, or ARPA-E, can also breathe easy. Trump\u2019s budget proposal recommended eliminating the popular program, but Congress gave it a $47 million boost up to $353 million. \n\nThe DOE\u2019s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy office, which the White House wanted to gut by $1.3 billion, also got a 15 percent increase to a new total of $2.3 billion. \n\nThere are also a few strange energy-related riders: The bill declares biomass as a carbon-neutral energy source, though scientists are still debating whether that\u2019s the case. Livestock producers are permanently exempted from the EPA\u2019s greenhouse gas regulations, killing any efforts to keep them in check. \n\nOn balance, the spending bill (if it passes) signals that while the Trump administration is desperate to save American coal and eliminate environmental regulations, lawmakers from both parties still think that protecting the environment is a high priority and that clean energy is a worthwhile endeavor. \n\nFederal agencies, however, have some discretion in how they spend the money Congress gives them, and some departments are dragging their feet when it comes to doing the work they\u2019re supposed to do. \n\nWe\u2019re already seeing grant applications and research programs being screened for references to climate change at the EPA, the DOE, and the Department of the Interior. The EPA has seen a decline in enforcement of rules against polluters, and lawmakers have complained that programs like ARPA-E have delayed or not issued the funding that they\u2019re required to provide. \n\nSo while many energy and environmental initiatives across government received more cash, there is still an ongoing fight to make sure the money actually gets spent. \n\nFurther reading", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Zack Beauchamp", "body": "President Trump finally jettisoned National Security Adviser HR McMaster on Thursday afternoon. His replacement is John Bolton, the former ambassador to the United Nations in the Bush administration \u2014 and one of the most radically hawkish voices in American foreign policy.\n\nBolton has said the United States should declare war on both North Korea and Iran. He was credibly accused of manipulating US intelligence on weapons of mass destruction prior to the Iraq war and of abusive treatment of his subordinates. He once \u201cjoked\u201d about knocking 10 stories off the UN building in New York. That means his new appointment to be the most important national security official in the White House has significant \u2014 and frightening \u2014 implications for Trump\u2019s approach to the world.\n\nBolton\u2019s new job was announced on Thursday evening, when the president tweeted that McMaster planned to resign and Bolton would replace him. \u201cI am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, [John Bolton] will be my new National Security Advisor,\u201d the president wrote.\n\nBolton had been rumored to be the frontrunner for the job for months, but that doesn\u2019t make the pick any less jarring. His track record in government, connections to anti-Muslim groups, and stated views in op-eds and public speeches all suggest that he will push Trump to take extremely dangerous positions on issues like North Korea, Iran, and ISIS.\n\n\u201cI operate on the assumption that John Bolton should be kept as far away from the levers of foreign policy as possible,\u201d says Christopher Preble, the vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. \u201cI think I would rest easy if he was dog catcher in Stone Mountain, Georgia. But maybe not.\u201d\n\nBolton elevation illustrates the degree to which the president is influenced by the conservative infotainment sphere, most notably Fox News \u2014 where he has long been an on-air fixture. Bolton was, prior to this appointment, a marginal figure in Washington foreign policy circles since his departure from the Bush administration. But he got himself one of the top jobs in in the country because his savvy work in the world of conservative media and advocacy groups.\n\nAs a result, American foreign policy may be soon be shaped by someone who seems to truly believe that war is the answer to the world\u2019s most pressing problems.\n\nJohn Bolton\u2019s early career shows why he\u2019s a dangerous choice for national security adviser\nBolton is, somewhat ironically, a quintessential creature of the Washington swamp.\n\nAfter graduating Yale Law School in 1974, where he had become friends with future Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, he went into private practice in Washington. He made a name for himself working in conservative politics, becoming vice president of the right-wing American Enterprise Institute and serving in midlevel roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until the George W. Bush administration that Bolton rose to greater prominence. In May 2001, Bush appointed him to be undersecretary of state for arms control, basically the top diplomat focusing on weapons of mass destruction. This position became fairly important in the runup to the Iraq War, as the Bush administration\u2019s case against Saddam Hussein focused on his alleged nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons.\n\nBolton took the hardest of possible lines. He forcefully argued that Iraq had WMDs \u2014 \u201cwe are confident that Saddam Hussein has hidden weapons of mass destruction,\u201d as he put in one 2002 speech. After Bush\u2019s 2002 State of the Union speech connecting North Korea, Iraq, and Iran as an \u201caxis of evil,\u201d Bolton insisted that this wasn\u2019t just rhetoric \u2014 that there was \u2018\u2019a hard connection between these regimes \u2014 an \u2018axis\u2019 along which flow dangerous weapons and dangerous technology.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe was involved in shaping US intelligence in the runup to the war \u2014 and not in a good way. In 2002, Bolton\u2019s staff prepared a speech alleging that Cuba had an active biological weapons program. This wasn\u2019t true, and the State Department\u2019s lead bioweapons analyst at the time would not sign off on the claim. Per the analyst\u2019s sworn testimony to Congress, Bolton then called the analyst into his office, screamed at him, and then sent for his boss. In this conversation, per the Washington Post\u2019s David Ignatius, he derisively referred to the analyst as a \u201cmunchkin\u201d and attempted to get him transferred to a different department.\n\nThis was cruel and unprofessional, but also dangerous. Carl Ford, then the assistant secretary of state for intelligence and research, testified that Bolton\u2019s assault on the analyst had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d throughout the department, freezing out dissent on proliferation issues beyond Cuba. John Prados, a fellow at George Washington University\u2019s National Security Archives, came to an even broader conclusion in a study of declassified Bush administration documents: Bolton bears a significant amount of blame for the politicized intelligence used to justify the decision to attack Iraq.\n\n\u201cAlthough Bolton\u2019s actions did not concern Iraq directly, they came to a high point during the summer of 2002 \u2014 the exact moment when Iraq intelligence issues were on the front burner \u2014 and they aimed at offices which played a central role in producing Iraq intelligence,\u201d Prados writes. \u201cAnalysts working on Iraq intelligence could not be blamed for concluding that their own careers might be in jeopardy if they supplied answers other than what the Bush administration wanted to hear.\u201d\n\nNone of this got Bolton fired. In fact, it got him promoted: In March 2005, President Bush nominated him to be US ambassador to the UN, one of the most important diplomatic positions in the entire government.\n\nBolton\u2019s Senate confirmation hearing turned into a vicious fight, largely over his role in shaping the faulty prewar intelligence about Iraq. But his management style, as exemplified by the munchkin incident, also became a huge issue. When Ford was called to testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he bluntly said Bolton\u2019s personality should disqualify him from holding high office. Ford called him a \u201cbully\u201d who \u201ckisses up and punches down,\u201d among other things.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m as conservative as John Bolton is,\u201d Ford told the committee. \u201cBut the fact is that the collateral damage and the personal hurt that he causes is not worth the price that had to be paid.\u201d\n\nMultiple people who had worked with Bolton came out of the woodwork to speak to these issues. Perhaps the most harrowing such account came in an open letter written by a former federal contractor named Melody Townsel, recalling a time that she raised issues surrounding the use of funds in a contract Bolton was working on. He didn\u2019t take it well:\n\nMr. Bolton proceeded to chase me through the halls of a Russian hotel \u2014 throwing things at me, shoving threatening letters under my door and, generally, behaving like a madman. For nearly two weeks, while I awaited fresh direction from my company and from US AID, John Bolton hounded me in such an appalling way that I eventually retreated to my hotel room and stayed there. Mr. Bolton, of course, then routinely visited me there to pound on the door and shout threats.\n\nAll in all, according to then-Sen. Joe Biden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time, testimony from at least five people confirmed multiple instances of Bolton behaving abusively toward subordinates and retaliating against intelligence professionals who challenged his policy positions. For these reasons, Bolton could not be confirmed by the Senate \u2014 which was, at the time, controlled by Republicans.\n\nBolton\u2019s Iraq-era activities are extraordinarily relevant for understanding what he\u2019ll push for as Trump\u2019s national security adviser (a position that doesn\u2019t require Senate confirmation).\n\nTechnically, his primary job will be running the National Security Council, which exists to coordinate and synthesize the sometimes conflicting policy proposals that emerge from the Pentagon, State Department, and other agencies. He will present the president with strategic assessments of high-level officials like the secretaries of defense and state, offer his own thinking, and then communicate Trump\u2019s ultimate decision to the agencies and work to ensure it\u2019s implemented.\n\nPut another way, his job is to manage the information that comes to the president and then present a clear-eyed and accurate assessment of what\u2019s happening and how to respond to it. Yet Bolton\u2019s history suggests a long and storied history of cherry-picking intelligence to support his preferred hawkish policies.\n\n\u201cBolton is so much of an ideologue,\u201d says Eoyang. \u201c that I don\u2019t think he would accurately portray consequences [of policy options] to the president.\u201d\n\nHis reported history of berating and undermining anyone who attempted to challenge him is likely to further stifle dissent. He\u2019ll have more power over the White House national security staff as national security adviser than anyone other than the president, giving him unprecedented ability to act as a \u201cbully,\u201d in Ford\u2019s words.\n\nIt\u2019s very plausible that Bolton will accelerate the brain drain from the federal government that already seems to be taking shape \u2014 not just in the White House but across the various departments that make foreign policy.\n\n\u201cBolton hates the State Department. He portrays US diplomats as closet Democrats and appeasers,\u201d Richard Gowan, a professor at Columbia University who has studied Bolton\u2019s career, recalls. \u201cAs NSA, he would almost certainly encourage the hollowing out of State Trump and [former Secretary of State Rex] Tillerson have begun.\u201d\n\nJohn Bolton represents the Fox News-ification of foreign policy\nUltimately, Bolton did get the UN ambassador position \u2014 though without the Senate\u2019s permission. In August 2005, President Bush appointed him to the post while the Senate was out of session (a so-called \u201crecess appointment\u201d).\n\nBolton\u2019s year and a half at the UN was characterized by showy condemnations of the organization, which infuriated American allies, but he had little influence on the UN or the overall arc of Bush\u2019s second-term foreign policy.\n\n\u201cBolton raised hell at the UN, but his actual power was quite limited,\u201d Gowan recalls. \u201cCondi Rice and the mainstream conservatives in the second Bush administration often ignored him. He is quite open about this in his memoirs from that period, which are fun.\u201d\n\nIn December 2006, Bolton called it quits, returning to civilian life. He became a fixture on Fox News and conservative talk radio, where his confirmation fight and anti-UN rhetoric was hailed as a sign of his willingness to speak truth to power. He was so prominent in these spheres, mostly through his contract as a Fox contributor, that he considered running for president in both 2012 and 2016.\n\nBolton was particularly popular among a small but influential group of hardline anti-Islam activists, the \u201ccounter-jihad\u201d movement, who believed the US government was being infiltrated by Islamists and that Islamic law was quietly taking over the US legal system.\n\nBolton wrote the foreword to a book by two of the most prominent counter-jihadists, Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer, in 2010. In 2016, Bolton spoke at a conference held by the American Freedom Alliance, considered a \u201chate group\u201d by the Southern Poverty Law Center, titled \u201cCan Islam and the West Coexist?\u201d His speech contained a \u201cjoke\u201d whose punchline was that President Obama was a Muslim.\n\nIn his many media appearances and public appearances, Bolton never wavered from the kind of hawkish policy views he established during the Bush administration. In a 2015 New York Times op-ed, Bolton advocated for a US and/or Israeli airstrike on Iranian nuclear facilities. \u201cTime is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSuch action should be combined with vigorous American support for Iran\u2019s opposition, aimed at regime change in Tehran.\u201d\n\nSince Trump took office, Bolton has put the media savvy and experience with the conservative movement he\u2019s developed to good use \u2014 using various levers to influence the president. In just the first months of 2018, Bolton has appeared on Fox News roughly 20 times. He has used those appearances to sell his policy preferences, warning against diplomacy with North Korea and encouraging te Kingdom of Jordan to annex the West Bank (much of which remains under Israeli occupation despite the fact that the vast majority of its citizens are Palestinian).\n\nDuring the early Trump administration, then-White House senior strategist Steve Bannon approached Bolton as part of a plan to get around Cabinet members, like Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, who opposed withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. Bolton drafted a five-page memo detailing his proposal for tearing up the deal, which he then published in National Review after Bannon departed the White House.\n\nAnd in February 2018, he published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal arguing that the US needed to solve the nuclear standoff with North Korea by force.\n\n\u201cPre-emption opponents argue that action is not justified because Pyongyang does not constitute an \u2018imminent threat.\u2019 They are wrong,\u201d Bolton wrote. \u201cIt is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current \u2018necessity\u2019 posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons by striking first.\u201d\n\nBolton\u2019s record in the Bush administration and general hawkishness made him a marginal figure in Washington foreign policy conversations. So after leaving, he cannily aligned himself with Fox News and other influential groups on the right, like the counter-jihadists, who saw him as an experienced and credible commentator. This led not only to television news and book contracts but to platforms through which he could potentially influence actual Republican elected officials.\n\nThis reached a kind of apogee with President Trump. Trump sees the world through a televisual lens; he seems to get more information from Fox News than from his daily intelligence briefings. The president values the advice of people he sees on the TV and other friendly media outlets. Bolton is not seen as a relic of the hated Bush administration; he\u2019s seen as an authoritative and expert Fox voice. According to Bolton\u2019s National Review piece, Trump once told him to \u201ccome in and see me any time\u201d in the White House.\n\nNow, of course, Bolton will have a permanent home in the White House. The reason he didn\u2019t have an administration sooner, according to some press accounts, is aesthetic. In December 2016, the Washington Post reported that Bolton was eliminated from the running for secretary of state because Trump \u2014 I swear I\u2019m not making this up \u2014 didn\u2019t like his mustache.\n\n\u201cDonald was not going to like that mustache,\u201d one Trump associate told the Post. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone that\u2019s really close to Donald that has a beard that he likes.\u201d\n\nPerhaps because of the mustache, Trump hadn\u2019t taken Bolton\u2019s policy advice to heart in his first year in office. There\u2019s no war with North Korea, and the Iran deal remains (largely) intact.\n\nBut now Bolton is national security adviser, with direct access to the president and tremendous influence over a vast and powerful national security bureaucracy. And many foreign policy experts are deeply concerned about what that means. \n\n\u201cThe United States has not hit rock bottom in our international relations,\u201d says Eoyang. \u201c[With Bolton], we could go lower.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Dara Lind", "body": "Donald Trump likes to portray himself as a leader \u2014 a decisive figure who gets things done. Nowhere is that more true than on immigration, the issue that made his political career. \n\nThat\u2019s the spirit in which he offered an eleventh-hour threat to veto the omnibus spending bill passed by Congress this week (which would keep the government open until the end of September). He claimed that he\u2019d veto the bill because it didn\u2019t contain enough money for his wall on the US/Mexico border \u2014 and because it didn\u2019t address the fate of the 690,000 unauthorized immigrants facing the loss of their protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\n\n\nI am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2018\n\n\n\n\nBut then he turned around and agreed to sign the bill anyway, just a few hours later. Which proves the underlying truth of Trump\u2019s immigration stance: his efforts at \u201cleadership\u201d are just temper tantrums.\n\nTrump\u2019s temper tantrums have, time and again, blown up efforts to find a permanent solution for DACA recipients. His last-minute attempt to use them as cover for an impulsive veto threat was transparently bullshit. And what made it all the more insulting was that he used them for a threat that he was inevitably, and quickly, going to abandon.\n\nIf Donald Trump cared about DACA recipients, he had better ways of showing it\nIf Donald Trump is really seriously concerned about a permanent solution for DACA recipients, here are some things he could have done:\n\n\nHe could have told Congress to pass a permanent solution for DACA recipients in September without winding down the program.\nHe could have stuck to his initial agreement with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to sign a bill that offered legal status to DACA recipients even if it didn\u2019t include any increases in immigration enforcement. \nHe could have accepted the deal proposed by a group of senators in January, designed to address Trump\u2019s four \u201cpillar\u201d immigration demands, instead of rejecting it for taking too many people from \u201cshithole countries.\u201d\n\nHe could have stuck to his (reportedly) tentative agreement with Schumer to sign a bill that would give citizenship to DREAMers in exchange for $25 billion for the wall over 10 years.\nHe could have agreed to support a bill proposed by a different bipartisan group of senators, which ended up getting over 50 votes in the Senate \u2014 much more than Trump\u2019s preferred bill got \u2014 and almost certainly would have passed that chamber had Trump endorsed it.\nHe could have told congressional Republicans at any time in the past several weeks that he wouldn\u2019t sign an omnibus bill that didn\u2019t at least extend DACA protections.\n\nHe did none of those things. Whether or not Donald Trump actually cares about the fate of DACA recipients, it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that he cares less about them than he does about getting his way.\n\nTrump just proved that Congress shouldn\u2019t take his threats seriously\nFor many congressional Republicans, the takeaway from the last several months of immigration drama has been that Trump can\u2019t actually be relied upon to make deals. \n\nHe throws out demands, then abandons them without a thought. He says he wants a deal and doesn\u2019t care about the specifics, then rejects a deal because it doesn\u2019t meet his specifications. \n\nThis is why congressional Republicans didn\u2019t line up behind the White House over the weekend, when it asked for $25 billion for the wall in exchange for three years\u2019 more protection for DACA recipients; Democrats rejected the proposal out of hand, and Republicans weren\u2019t willing to shut down the government over something just because the White House came up with it. \n\nIt\u2019s why Congress sent Trump a spending bill that didn\u2019t defund sanctuary cities, which was the White House\u2019s initial line in the sand for threatening a veto: they thought Trump would back down, and he did.\n\nAnd it\u2019s why Congress didn\u2019t respond to Trump\u2019s eleventh-hour veto threat over the wall and DACA with a scramble to make a deal. They haven\u2019t been able to make a deal on those issues because whenever Trump has said he wants a deal, he rejects the deal in front of him. Congress bet that this time, he didn\u2019t want a deal badly enough to shut down the government over it \u2014 that the passing fancy he tweeted the morning after Congress had voted on the bill would be gone by the afternoon. And they were right.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Zack Beauchamp", "body": "Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was fired by President Donald Trump, according to White House officials\u2019 statements on Tuesday morning. He was in office for a little over a year, one of the shortest tenures in modern history \u2014 and it was not, experts say, a distinguished one.\n\n\u201cTillerson would be at or near the bottom of the list of secretaries of state, not just in the post-Second World War world but in the record of US secretaries of state,\u201d says Paul Musgrave, a scholar of US foreign policy at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.\n\nThe former ExxonMobil CEO, whose nomination was initially greeted warmly by prominent foreign policy hands, will leave without any major accomplishments. This is largely because he failed to wield any significant influence in internal administration debates over issues like North Korea or Russia, in fact actively alienating the president during several key policy debates. \n\nHis push to slash \u201cinefficiencies\u201d in the State Department and seeming disinterest in working closely with longtime staff were even more damaging. Under Tillerson\u2019s watch, 60 percent of State\u2019s top-ranking career diplomats resigned and new applications to join the foreign service fell by half, according to a November count by the American Foreign Service Association. This hollowing out of the foreign service, combined with Tillerson\u2019s inability to appoint people to vital positions like Ambassador to South Korea, delayed American responses to major crises and weakened the State Department for a \u201cgeneration,\u201d according to George Washington University\u2019s Elizabeth Saunders. \n\nThis can\u2019t all be blamed on Tillerson: even a skilled and experienced diplomat would have had trouble maintaining influence in the chaotic Trump White House, a place where foreign policy is often made by tweet. As if to underscore the point, Trump announced Tillerson\u2019s departure in a tweet \u2014 before the secretary himself could make a statement.\n\nYet scholars and foreign policy practitioners across the political spectrum agree that he deserves much of the blame.\n\n\"I think he really will go down as one of the worst secretaries of State we've had,\" Eliot Cohen, counselor to the State Department under President George W. Bush, told Axios\u2019 Jonathan Swan. \u201cHe will go down as the worst Secretary of State in history,\u201d tweeted Ilan Goldenberg, an Obama-era State Department official.\n\nTillerson was expected by many to be one of the \u201cadults in the room,\u201d helping Secretary of Defense James Mattis rein in some of Trump\u2019s most wild ideas. His attempts to play that role backfired \u2014 his ham-handed attempts to manage Trump alienated the president, who has reportedly complained about his \u201ctotally establishment\u201d views on foreign policy. \n\nWhen you combine the lack of influence over Trump with Tillerson\u2019s dismantling of the State Department\u2019s staff \u2014 he made more of a mess of the department in a shorter amount of time than any other secretary of state in history \u2014 you have a truly disastrous tenure in Foggy Bottom.\n\n\u201cHe took the job and made it smaller,\u201d Musgrave says.\n\nTillerson failed at the thing he was supposed to be good at\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        (Leon Neal/Getty Images)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nWhen Trump announced Tillerson as his pick for secretary of state, back in December 2016, the foreign policy community was of two minds on the appointment. \n\nAs CEO of ExxonMobil, one of the world\u2019s largest corporations, Tillerson seemed to be more than qualified to effectively manage a sprawling bureaucracy like the State Department. Mainstream GOP foreign policy experts like former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and former National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley all praised the pick.\n\n\"He would bring to the position vast knowledge, experience and success in dealing with dozens of governments and leaders in every corner of the world,\u201d Gates said in a statement. \"He is a person of great integrity whose only goal in office would be to protect and advance the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nCritics, though, worried about his close relationship with Vladimir Putin and Exxon\u2019s willingness to strike deals with corrupt foreign dictators and history of lobbying against action climate change (though the corporation now says it accepts climate science). During his January confirmation hearings, senators grilled him about both Russia and climate, with Democrats clearly unsatisfied by his answers.\n\n\"Do you lack the knowledge to answer my question, or refuse to answer my question?\" Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) puffed, after Tillerson repeatedly stonewalled his questions about Exxon funding climate change denial. \"A little of both,\u201d Tillerson replied.\n\nTillerson was confirmed in late January 2017 nonetheless, in a vote that basically fell along party lines. Quickly, he set about upending everyone\u2019s views about him. As soon as March, it had become clear that the convention wisdom was 100 percent wrong. The fears about Tillerson\u2019s policy views had proven overblown, mostly because he had been completely overshadowed in internal White House deliberations over issues like Syria and Russia.\n\n\u201cMore than a month after he became America\u2019s top diplomat, Rex Tillerson is like no other modern secretary of State: he\u2019s largely invisible,\u201d the LA Times\u2019 Tracy Wilkinson reported at the time. \u201cHis influence at the White House is difficult to discern. He appears to be competing with Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, and Stephen Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist, both of whom have Trump\u2019s ear on foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThe optimism about Tillerson\u2019s management acumen, by contrast, had clearly been badly misplaced. Tillerson failed to place political appointees in a number of vital leadership positions, failed to spend a lot of time with his own employees, and pushed out longtime employees without clear replacements in mind. Morale inside the organization collapsed.\n\n\u201cI used to love my job,\u201d one staffer told The Atlantic\u2019s Julia Ioffe at the time. \u201cNow, it feels like coming to the hospital to take care of a terminally ill family member. You come in every day, you bring flowers, you brush their hair, paint their nails, even though you know there\u2019s no point. But you do it out of love.\u201d\n\nWhat was true in March remained true for the rest of Tillerson\u2019s brief tenure. On issue after issue, Tillerson proved to be out-of-touch with the president\u2019s foreign policy positions.\n\nThe US bombed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in early April \u2014 just days after Tillerson suggested the administration would be fine with Assad staying in power. On June 9, Tillerson called on Saudi Arabia and its allies to end their isolation of Qataraaa; less than two hours later, Trump sided with the Saudis by labeling Qatar \u201ca funder of terrorism at a very high level.\u201d On July 20, after a meeting in which the president reportedly asked for a major expansion of America\u2019s nuclear arsenal, Tillerson told aides that the president was a moron \u2014 or, according to some reports, a \u201cfucking moron.\u201d One time, Tillerson tried to open the door to negotiations with North Korea \u2014 and Trump slapped him down in a tweet.\n\nThe staffing problem at the State Department remained bad throughout Tillerson\u2019s tenure, and in some ways got even worse. Only 64 out of 153 political appointees had confirmed by the Senate, according to a count by the Washington Post and Partnership for Public Service. He had not nominated anyone to be the assistant secretary supervising vital regions like Asia and the Middle East, nor did he nominate ambassadors for countries as important as Saudi Arabia and South Korea. \n\nThis kind of vacancy is devastating. \n\nPolitical appointees are necessary to shape policy, as they serve as a conduit between the administration and foreign governments. Without people in these positions, career diplomats fill in as best they can, but they have a hard time making new decisions or formulating new policy. It\u2019s nigh-unprecedented to go this long with this many vacancies because it cripples America\u2019s ability to develop diplomatic stances on vital issues. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not like this was a quiet time. During Tillerson\u2019s tenure, tensions over North Korea\u2019s nuclear program got so bad that war started to seem like a real possibility \u2014 and then President Trump decided to sit down with Kim Jong Un for the first-ever direct negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang. One US ally in the Gulf (Saudi Arabia) laid economic siege to another (Qatar). Russia apparently poisoned a double agent on British soil.\n\n\u201cWhen I was assistant secretary, I was sworn in early April [of the first year],\u201d says Hank Cohen, the Assistant Secretary of State for Africa under George H.W. Bush. \u201cIt\u2019s a big problem.\u201d\n\nAnd even the career staff suffered under Tillerson. He eliminated entire segments of the department, like the department that tracked war crimes. He imposed limits on transfers inside the organization, typically a way the State Department deals with staffing shortages, in late June. He publicly defended a Trump administration proposal to cut his department\u2019s budget by 30 percent, and at the time of his departure was pushing a plan to cut the permanent staff by eight percent despite repeated rebukes from Congress. He cut the department off from vital recruiting sources, like the Presidential Management Fellow program.\n\n\u201cSecretary Tillerson\u2019s term has led to widespread demoralization in the foreign service, the dismissal or resignation of people with expertise that individually may not be irreplaceable but as a cohort certainly becomes so,\u201d Musgrave says. \u201cThat hinders the State Department\u2019s ability to enhance US interests through diplomacy.\u201d\n\nThe consequences may not be visible immediately. But the State Department\u2019s personnel shortfalls could prevent the United States from successfully reaching a diplomatic solution to issues in everything ranging from the South China Sea to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. You can\u2019t negotiate very well if you don\u2019t have people who know how to do it \u2014 and more people the State Department loses, the longer-term the consequences of these problems are, as there\u2019s no one to promote to senior roles.\n\nSaunders analogizes the US under Tillerson\u2019s emaciated State Department to a person who doesn\u2019t have health insurance. \u201cYour life is probably fine \u2014 up until the point you get sick,\u201d she says.\n\nThe source of Tillerson\u2019s failures are both Trump and his own choices\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Tillerson (L), Trump, and Mattis.\n      \n      \n        (Michael Reynolds-Pool/Getty Images)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nWhy did things go so wrong for Tillerson?\n\nSome of the blame has to be paid at his boss\u2019 feet. Trump is running a chaotic administration that has nominated a shockingly low number of political appointees across practically every department. The White House shot down so many of Tillerson\u2019s picks for top deputies that he actually screamed at a group of White House aides during a meeting. Trump personally displayed little-to-no interest in learning from the expertise of State Department personnel, preferring instead to push his own pet priorities, like weakening the Iran deal and withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord.\n\n\u201cIt may be that, in a Trump administration, the structural realities of the way the White House works you can only choose among varieties of failure,\u201d Musgrave says.\n\nBut that excuse only goes so far. Secretary of Defense James Mattis hasn\u2019t been immune to Trump\u2019s bizarre management style \u2014 he was blindsided, most notably, by Trump\u2019s proposal to ban transgender people from serving in the military \u2014 but on the whole has been far more effective at advocating for his department\u2019s interests and gaining influence over the president\u2019s decision-making.\n\nYou can say that this is because Trump has more respect for generals that diplomats, and that\u2019s partially true. Another part of it is that Mattis seemed better at handling Trump\u2019s mercurial nature; according the New York Times, Tillerson frequently annoyed the president in meeting  by (among other things) saying \u201cit\u2019s your deal\u201d whenever Trump overruled him.\n\nBut a third and vital part of it, experts say, is that Mattis \u2014 a career military professional and former general \u2014 is substantially better at working in Washington. In particular, Mattis understood that working closely with his staff in the Pentagon allowed him to advance policy ideas through the bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cMattis is drawing on the expertise of his building. Some of that is a product of [his own] experience,\u201d Saunders says. \u201cTillerson is not a creature of his building, nor is he a creature of government at all.\u201d\n\nBy most accounts, Tillerson failed to build relationships with people in Foggy Bottom, relying instead on an insular inner-circle made up of a few longtime confidantes. This decision \u201cconstitutes the core of his failure,\u201d according to Musgrave: it made it hard both for Tillerson to garner influence inside the White House and to understand what his staff could do and how to deploy them effectively.\n\n\u201cTillerson had a half-dozen, maybe a dozen aides who are not familiar with Washington and especially not familiar with the State Department,\u201d Musgrave says. \u201cBut he seems to rely on these people who are loyal to him, known to him, at the expense of building relationships with the people in the building.\u201d\n\nPerhaps if Tillerson had developed closer relationships with State\u2019s career staff, he would have understood supporting budget cuts to his own department and staff downsizing would demoralize them. Perhaps he would have been able to develop new ideas that would have gotten the president\u2019s ear. Perhaps he would have been more able to convince the White House to trust his judgment on political appointees.\n\nPerhaps, perhaps, perhaps. But the truth is we won\u2019t know because Tillerson, to a degree nearly unprecedented in State\u2019s history, failed to even try to work with his own department.\n\nAll of which begs the question: Why did this multi-millionaire leave his cushy job at the head of one of the world\u2019s largest corporations and then take a job at a government bureaucracy he didn\u2019t understand and seemingly didn\u2019t respect?\n\nIt\u2019s a question only Tillerson can answer.

And so now, at Zinke\u2019s behest, the department\u2019s Washington headquarters flies a secretarial flag when Zinke arrives for the day and lowers it when he leaves. \n\nFlag raising, a Navy tradition, isn\u2019t something that\u2019s done for other Cabinet officials, and it isn\u2019t Zinke\u2019s only flamboyance. The former Navy SEAL ordered an upgrade of his office doors for an initial cost of $139,000, minted his own challenge coin, rode a horse to his first day of work, and displayed his knife collection in his office before security asked him to remove it.  \n\nBut these stunts are mere distractions from Zinke\u2019s real influence as interior secretary. Since he was sworn in on March 1, 2017, to lead the $12 billion agency in charge of federal lands and natural resources, he\u2019s made unprecedented changes that could leave a lasting mark on America\u2019s wilderness and its environment. \n\nFrom his recent proposal to open almost all of America\u2019s coast to offshore drilling to rolling back federal protections on national monuments, Zinke has taken extraordinary steps to make public lands more accessible to fossil fuel companies and other industries. Part of what he\u2019s doing is selling mineral and energy rights to our public lands through leases \u2014 and potentially lowering royalties for industries in the process. In line with Trump\u2019s interest in expanding mining on federal lands, Zinke has made critical mineral production a top priority. \n\n\u201cWhen Zinke was nominated, he told the American people that he was a conservationist in the tradition of Teddy Roosevelt, and he was committed to stewarding our public lands, and he was concerned about issues like global warming,\u201d says Jay Turner, an environmental historian at Wellesley College. \u201cIn practice, Zinke has aggressively worked to open up our public lands and natural resources to development by private interests and aggressively rolled back regulations meant to protect those resources and address issues like climate change.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Paul Morigi/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nMeanwhile, Zinke has caught the attention of government watchdog groups that are already calling for ethics investigations into his activities. Documents show that he used noncommercial planes to travel back to his hometown in Whitefish, Montana, and to fly between Caribbean islands. He\u2019s also taken expensive helicopter flights around DC and to political events. \n\nZinke was grilled about these flights during a Senate committee hearing on March 13. When Energy and Natural Resources committee member Maria Cantwell asked if he considered the private flights a mistake, Zinke responded: \u201cI resent the fact that of your insults. I resent the fact they\u2019re misleading.\u201d (He also said he resented \u201cthe fact of the [$139,000] doors.\u201d)\n\nControversy swirled again when, in an effort to rebuild Puerto Rico\u2019s battered grid after Hurricane Maria, the island\u2019s governor inked a deal with a little-known contractor from Zinke\u2019s hometown funded by a donor to President Trump instead of invoking mutual aid agreements with other utilities right away. \n\nAllegations of political favoritism and loyalty to industry are recurring themes in five of Zinke\u2019s biggest decisions to date, which affect the lives of millions of Americans. \n\n\n1) Opening the bulk of the US coast to oil and gas drilling \n\nIn January, Zinke announced a proposal to allow offshore oil and gas drilling around most of the United States, including in water off the coasts of California and Maine and the eastern Gulf of Mexico. \n\nThe five-year proposal, from 2019 to 2024, would open up about 90 percent of the region known as the Outer Continental Shelf \u2014 the biggest offshore lease sale ever. \n\nThis is great if you\u2019re in the oil industry. If the draft proposal goes through, energy companies will be able to bid on 47 lease auctions in 25 \u201cplanning areas\u201d along the edges of the lower 48 states and Alaska.\n\nBut not everyone is thrilled by the decision. Florida Gov. Rick Scott, for example, immediately asked to meet with Zinke.\n\n\nShortly after Scott objected, Zinke removed Florida from the draft proposal because Florida is \u201cunique and its coasts are heavily reliant on tourism as an economic driver.\u201d (Many interpreted it as a brazen political favor to Scott.) Now 12 other states want out.\n\nThis new offshore drilling announcement comes shortly after the new Republican tax law became a Trojan horse for new drilling in the Arctic. \n\nOpening up the coastal area of Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) for oil development was the key to securing a \u201cyes\u201d vote from Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) on the GOP tax package.  \n\nThe federal government is now required to complete at least two oil and gas lease sales in  ANWR over the next decade. \n\n\n2) The largest rollback in federal land protections in history\n\nIn December, Trump moved ahead with recommendations from Zinke and announced that his administration will roll back federal protections on 2 million acres of land in two national monuments in Utah, the Bears Ears monument and the Grand Staircase-Escalante monument.\n\nThe move, Trump said, is to \u201cto reverse federal overreach and restore the rights of this land to your citizens.\u201d But he also hinted at a financial upside for certain parties, claiming that federal oversight has led to \u201cunnecessary restrictions on hunting, ranching, and responsible economic development.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times recently obtained emails from the Department of Interior that show the Trump administration had an interest in oil and gas opportunities in the area before the sites were publicly reviewed last spring. One email details a map that would \u201cresolve all known mineral conflicts\u201d on protected land that Utah public schools wanted to lease out by changing the border of the Bears Ears monument. \n\nBears Ears \u2014 which was designated by President Barack Obama in one of his last acts in office \u2014 stands to lose 1.1 million acres, or 85 percent, of its land area. The Grand Staircase-Escalante monument would be reduced by 800,000 acres, or 45 percent. The rollback is the first step to opening up these lands to more industrial development and agriculture, breaking Bears Ears into two separate monuments and Grand Staircase-Escalante into three.\n\n\u201cThis type of reversal of executive action generates serious instability for anyone who depends on the resource or landscape one way or another,\u201d Adam Sowards says. \u201cFlip-flopping executive actions is no recipe for solving problems, stabilizing policy, or protecting the environment.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Sowards wrote in High Country News, one president rescinding another president\u2019s action isn\u2019t the sort of separation of powers founders envisioned. \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Michael Nigro/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThe administration is stepping into uncharted legal territory with this decision. There\u2019s never been a ruling on whether a president can decrease the size of a national monument. Five Native American tribes have joined in a lawsuit charging that the president has no power to decrease the size of national monuments like Bears Ears. (A separate lawsuit filed by 10 environmental groups makes a similar argument, but for the Grand Staircase-Escalante monument.) \n\nThe Interior department doesn\u2019t see its attempt to revoke the monuments\u2019 status as a \u201csale\u201d of public land. Zinke\u2019s press secretary says in an email to Vox that, \u201cSecretary Zinke is opposed to the sale or transfer of federal lands and has not sold or transferred a single acre of land except where Congress has mandated or where land swaps were arranged. In fact, the Secretary has expanded the federal estate by approving land acquisitions and swaps.\u201d\n\n\n3) A proposal to raid the National Petroleum Reserve\n\nInterior is also trying to open up the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A) in pursuit of the Trumpian goal of \u201cenergy dominance.\u201d NPR-A is the largest federally owned land unit in the United States. There have been 12 sales there since 1999, but the proposed lease sale of 10.3 million acres in the reserve would be the largest ever for that area of federal land. \n\nWhy is this land needed? Zinke has said that the management plan developed by the previous administration for the land is overly restrictive, and Alaska lawmakers have had their eye on it. \u201c...exploration and development of the NPR-A offers a promising opportunity to fill TAPS (the Trans Alaska Pipeline System), boost Alaska\u2019s economy, and protect America\u2019s energy security,\u201d Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) said when the Bureau of Land Management announced the sale. \n\nBut environmental activists are concerned about the spread of oil development at NPR-A, particularly the potential damage that could be done to such a huge area of protected land with so many unique ecosystems.\n\n\n4) Land protections are for the birds\n\nIn 2015, the Obama administration came to an agreement with Western states, oil and gas companies, and environmentalists about how to protect the greater sage grouse, the largest grouse in North America, and its fragile sagebrush habitat across the West. It was, by many accounts, the biggest conservation collaboration in US history, involving 15 planning areas in 10 states and costing $45 million.\n\nBut in June 2017, the Interior Department took steps to begin rolling back the current agreement, which limits oil and gas development and other commercial activities on federally owned land in 10 states that has been recognized as territory for these birds. \n\nThen, according to Sierra, the magazine of the Sierra Club, \u201cA month later, the Western Energy Alliance, an oil and gas industry trade group, sent Zinke a letter [about the plans] in which the word \u2018burdensome\u2019 occurred seven times in four pages. When Zinke\u2019s review was completed in August, it included or addressed 13 of the alliance\u2019s 15 requests for changes, sometimes almost word for word.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration didn\u2019t give Endangered Species Act protections to the bird in 2015, partly because this land management plan was already released earlier that year, according to the Hill. The Interior Department is expected to amend the greater sage grouse plans later this year, but the regulatory process is likely to take years.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Helen H. Richardson/The Denver Post via Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n5)  Greenlighting new roads in the wilderness\n\nThe Washington Post reported in early January that the Interior Department approved a land swap deal that will allow a road to be built through Izembek National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. The road, which will connect the small villages of King Cove and Cold Bay, would cut through 492 square miles of preserved wetland and coastal habitat. If this plan goes through, it would be the first time that a new road is built through federally protected wilderness. \n\nKing Cove residents have requested a 12-mile gravel road be built to improve their access to the closest all-weather airport to reach hospitals in Anchorage. Throughout the decades-long fight, opponents have highlighted the fact that the road would benefit a private company, connecting the Peter Pan Seafood company in King Cove to the airport in King Bay. \n\nThe US government has already spent more than $50 million on alternative solutions like a local clinic and a hovercraft, according to the Washington Post. \n\nEnvironmental advocacy groups point out that there are federal laws against creating new roads through protected areas of land, and they\u2019re prepared to put up a fight. \n\nIn 2013, the New York Times reported, Obama\u2019s Interior Secretary Sally Jewell \u201cfound that a road would cause irreparable harm to Izembek\u2019s ecology and wildlife, including the grizzly bear, caribou and geese for whom the refuge is a critical habitat.\u201d\n\nSecretary Zinke made the road construction official on January 22. \n\nClarification: An earlier version of this story wasn\u2019t clear about how Interior can open up public land for development.

It turns out the hacker who caused chaos in the United States elections made a small but critical error that allowed U.S. investigators to trace his identity:\n\n\nBut on one occasion, The Daily Beast has learned, Guccifer failed to activate the VPN client before logging on. As a result, he left a real, Moscow-based Internet Protocol address in the server logs of an American social media company, according to a source familiar with the government\u2019s Guccifer investigation. Twitter and WordPress were Guccifer 2.0\u2019s favored outlets. Neither company would comment for this story, and Guccifer did not respond to a direct message on Twitter.\n\nWorking off the IP address, U.S. investigators identified Guccifer 2.0 as a particular GRU officer working out of the agency\u2019s headquarters on Grizodubovoy Street in Moscow. (The Daily Beast\u2019s sources did not disclose which particular officer worked as Guccifer.)\n\n\nThe Guccifer 2.0 revelation is a big deal for a few reasons. 1) It piles on to the evidence that Russia attempted to interfere in the U.S. elections. 2) It raises more questions about the Trump campaign\u2019s connections to Russia, given the well-documented chats between Guccifer 2.0 and Trump adviser and surrogate Roger Stone. 3) Finally, it could mark a development in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, though Mueller\u2019s office declined to comment for the Daily Beast\u2019s story.\n\nAttributing Guccifer 2.0 to Russian military intelligence means Mueller can charge someone\nIn February, Mueller indicted 13 Russian nationals tied to the Internet Research Agency, accusing them of spreading propaganda to interference and influence the U.S. elections. It\u2019s highly unlikely that those Russians will ever see the inside of a U.S. courtroom, but the indictments laid out a compelling case against the Kremlin.\n\nThose indictments did not tackle other elements of Russia alleged cyber campaign against the U.S., including the hack of the DNC and the subsequent dumps on Wikileaks. But if U.S. authorities have attributed Guccifer 2.0 to a specific member of Russian military intelligence, Mueller likely has the ability to charge him or her.\n\nThe Daily Beast reports that Mueller has, in fact, taken over the investigation into Guccifer 2.0, and has brought the investigators who tracked the officer down onto his team. \n\nIt\u2019s unclear what, if anything, might come next. But it will be much harder for Trump, or his defenders, to blame the hack on just a \u201ca 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.\u201d That goes for Stone, who tried to push the narrative that Guccifer 2.0 was a random dude, not the Russians, and released messages the two exchanged to debunk the Kremlin connection.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and other top law enforcement officials are hosting a press conference Friday morning to cover a \u201cmajor cyber law enforcement announcement.\u201d It is reportedly not Mueller related, but the timing sure is interesting.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jen Kirby", "body": "President Donald Trump teased a veto before signing the massive $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill on Thursday.

That would let the head of the executive branch essentially take a red pen to legislators\u2019 work, editing out the parts he doesn\u2019t like.\n\n\u201cTo prevent the omnibus situation from ever happening again,\u201d Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for a government spending bills.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s only one problem: Congress tried that before, and the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional. Presidents retain the veto power, of course, but it\u2019s all or nothing \u2014 they can\u2019t pick and choose which parts of the legislation they want to sign. \n\nThe Supreme Court declared the line-item veto unconstitutional almost 20 years ago. The challenge came during the Clinton administration, after the Congress passed the short-lived Line Item Veto Act of 1996, which gave the president the power to scratch certain items from spending and tax bills. \n\nCongress supported the law as a way to cut back on waste and pork-barrel spending in an attempt to get the federal deficit under control \u2014 though, as the Washington Post reported in 1998, lawmakers\u2019 enthusiasm \u201ccooled\u201d after Clinton started nixing some legislators\u2019 favored projects. Clinton used the power 82 times on 11 laws, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe challenge to the line-item veto came from New York City and its health care and hospital workers, after the president struck down a tax break tied to Medicaid funding; and from Idaho potato farmers, who fought back after Clinton knocked off a beneficial provision in a tax bill. \n\nThe Supreme Court ruled 6 to 3, in Clinton v. City of New York, that the line-item veto was unconstitutional because it gave unilateral power to the president to amend the text of laws \u2014 which is the legislative branch\u2019s, not the president\u2019s, territory. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion, saying line-item vetoes are \u201cthe functional equivalent of partial repeals of acts of Congress.\u201d \n\n\u201cThere is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the president to enact, to amend or to repeal statutes,\u201d he added.\n\nBasically, the Supreme Court said, it\u2019s up to Congress to get rid of the wasteful spending themselves, and send the final product to the president for him to sign, or reject, in full. If they didn\u2019t like this process, then they\u2019d have to amend the Constitution.\n\nThe line-item veto has been something presidents have wanted apparently since at least Ulysses S. Grant, and many governors do have line-item veto power for appropriations bills in their states. Other presidents have tried to bring back the idea in some form since the Supreme Court\u2019s 1998 decision. \n\nBush made an attempt in 2006, trying to re-write the law so Congress could override a line-item veto with a simple majority, rather than a two-thirds vote (which is needed to override a regular old presidential veto.) Obama considered asking in 2010.

But their technology was fake. \n\nMattis not only served on Theranos\u2019s board during some of the years it was perpetrating the fraud, after he retired from US military service, he earlier served as a key advocate of putting the company\u2019s technology (technology that was, to be clear, fake) to use inside the military while he was still serving as a general. Holmes is settling the case, paying a $500,000 fee and accepting various other penalties, while Balwani is fighting it out in court. \n\nNobody on the board is being directly charged with doing anything. But accepting six-figure checks to serve as a frontman for a con operation is the kind of thing that would normally count as a liability in American politics. \n\nBut nobody wants to talk about it. Not just Trump and his co-partisans in Congress, but the Democratic Party opposition is also inclined to give Mattis a pass. Everyone in Washington is more-or-less convinced that his presence in the Pentagon is the only thing standing between us and possible nuclear Armageddon. \n\nIt\u2019s an absurd, intolerable situation, but that\u2019s life in America in 2018 \u2014 and a perfect illustration of how Trump\u2019s unfitness for office exerts a corrosive influence throughout American life. \n\nJames Mattis profited off helping Theranos perpetrate a fraud\nTheranos was the kind of story that a lot of people wanted to believe in. A technology startup led by a bright, young Stanford dropout that unlike so many essentially frivolous apps was actually going to solve the urgent problem of making health care cheaper and easier to access. The basic problem, as exposed by the Wall Street Journal\u2019s John Carreyrou in an October 2015 expos\u00e9, was that the whole thing was a sham. \n\nTheranos\u2019s key technology, the Edison, didn\u2019t really work, and Theranos wasn\u2019t actually using it to perform its blood tests, relying instead on older Samsung equipment. They offered lower prices than the competition not because they had an innovative new product, but because they were a money-losing startup burning cash raised from venture capitalists. \n\nThis scheme worked because Theranos was deeply tied in with the American political, business, and media establishment \u2014 counting former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George Shultz as board members, and maintaining enough clout that Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign was unwise enough to schedule a high-profile fundraiser with Holmes months after the publication of Carreyrou\u2019s expos\u00e9. \n\nBut perhaps none of these elite supporters was as valuable as Mattis. \n\nAs the SEC complaint describes, a main element of the fraud was that \u201cHolmes, and Balwani claimed that Theranos\u2019 products were deployed by the U.S. Department of Defense on the battlefield in Afghanistan and on medevac helicopters and that the company would generate more than $100 million in revenue in 2014.\u201d \n\nHolmes, the SEC alleged, \u201cknew, or was reckless in not knowing, that these statements were false and misleading.\u201d It\u2019s easy to see, however, why investors might be fooled about this because one of the company\u2019s board members, Mattis, joined Theranos in 2013 immediately after retiring from a long career of military service that concluded with a stint leading CENTCOM, the US combatant command that is responsible for, among other things, Afghanistan. \n\nMattis (who, obviously, has no expertise in medical testing) pushed for the military to use Theranos technology, but it was never actually used because it didn\u2019t work. \n\nNonetheless, as of December 2015, Mattis was still vouching for the company, telling the Washington Post that he \u201chad quickly seen tremendous potential in the technologies Theranos develops, and I have the greatest respect for the company\u2019s mission and integrity.\u201d \n\nThe technology, it is now clear, had no potential and the company had no integrity. \n\nNobody has properly questioned Mattis about this\nThe SEC charges are new. \n\nBut by the time Mattis was selected to serve as Trump\u2019s Secretary of Defense in January 2017, the basic scope of the fraud was already well-known to the public thanks to diligent journalistic work. So was the fact that Mattis was not only earning $150,000 a year for his service on the Theranos board but also that he was involved in pro-Theranos advocacy while serving on active duty. \n\nHe duly resigned from Theranos on January 5, 2017 \u2014 by which time the company was already commonly described as \u201cembroiled in scandal\u201d by press reports \u2014 but, remarkably, the whole affair didn\u2019t come up at his confirmation hearings. \n\nIt\u2019s not exactly rare for members of a corporate board of directors to be window-dressing with no actual involvement in or knowledge of a company\u2019s operations, so the mere fact that the whole company was a giant scam doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect any action on Mattis\u2019s part. That said, at least in theory, directors are supposed to do something, and serving as window-dressing for a massive fraud is the kind of thing that normally reflects poorly on a person\u2019s reputation. \n\nWhat\u2019s more, as Paul Szoldra writes at Task and Purpose, pre-retirement Mattis genuinely seems to have been actively involved in trying to help Theranos bypass the regulatory process:\n\n\n\u201cI would very much appreciate your help in getting this information corrected with the regulatory agencies,\u201d Holmes wrote in an email to Mattis, also obtained by the Post. \u201cSince this misinformation came from within DoD, it will be invaluable if this information is formally corrected by the right people in DoD.\u201d\n\nThe general then forwarded the email chain on and asked, \u201chow do we overcome this new obstacle?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have tried to get this device tested in theater asap, legally and ethically,\u201d Mattis wrote. \u201cThis appears to be relatively straight-forward yet we\u2019re a year into this and not yet deployed.\u201d\n\n\nYet even with the SEC now throwing the book at the company, nobody in Congress is interested in asking Mattis what, exactly, he knew about Theranos and when. And the worst thing about it is their inclination to treat him with kid gloves makes a lot of sense. \n\nNobody wants us all to get killed \nA longtime concern many people have had about Donald Trump is that while the Silvio Berlusconi era in Italy was mostly funny, putting a temperamental and ignorant man in charge of the mightiest empire the world has ever known risks leading to the deaths of millions of people. \n\nAs Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) put it during the campaign, it would be unwise to give \u201cthe nuclear codes of the United States to an erratic individual.\u201d Rubio eventually endorsed Trump for president, though he pointedly declined to retract that claim. \n\nNothing Trump has actually done since taking office \u2014 from provoking a small diplomatic crisis with Australia to accidentally (?) leaking classified Israeli intelligence to the Russian foreign minister to firing his secretary of State on Twitter \u2014 has served to debunk the notion that his decision-making process is impulsive and unsound.  \n\n\n\n\"A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.\" \u2014Hillary\n\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) July 29, 2016\n\n\n\n\nIn this context, Mattis is near-universally viewed as an island of stability. Respected by the right for having been fired by President Barack Obama, he is also well-informed and (despite the nickname \u201cMad Dog\u201d) level-headed. Like most career military officers, he is less cavalier about the risks of war than many civilian hawks and, generally speaking, almost everyone in Washington sleeps better knowing that he is running the Defense Department. \n\nThe Theranos thing is a bad look, but there are plenty of Trump Cabinet corruption scandals to talk about \u2014 the Ben Carson one is funniest \u2014 so it\u2019s not like Democrats are lacking for general partisan ammunition. If Mattis comes under pressure he might quit or get fired and who knows who Trump might tap to replace him. \n\nUnder the circumstances, a softball approach to Mattis seems warranted no matter how rotten the signal that sends to the rest of the military, the business community, and the public about the wisdom of getting mixed-up in fraudulent endeavors.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Ezra Klein", "body": "\u201cWhen the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s John Brennan, the former CIA director, slamming Donald Trump after his attorney general fired former FBI Director Andrew McCabe. Those are not normal comments from a former CIA director. But then, these are not normal times.  \n\nMcCabe\u2019s firing shows how Trump has corroded the operations of the American government. There are real questions about McCabe\u2019s performance at the FBI. But there are even deeper questions about Trump\u2019s public vendetta against McCabe, and the role Sessions played in his termination.\n\nMcCabe is not innocent of wrongdoing. He made a questionable call (at best) about allowing a leak to the press during the 2016 campaign and then he appears to have lied about it, though he says it was an honest mistake. You can imagine a normal administration, and a normal process, weighing McCabe\u2019s actions carefully and seriously.\n\nBut none of this is why Trump wanted McCabe gone, and \u201ccarefully and seriously\u201d is not how the process was conducted. Trump wanted McCabe gone because of McCabe\u2019s involvement in the Justice Department investigation of Russian meddling in the campaign. Trump thinks McCabe is a Comey-aligned Democrat who was biased against him. Trump believes his political appointees should protect him. Trump has been explicit in public about all of this. And he has spent months publicly slandering McCabe and pressuring Sessions to fire him. \n\nTrump\u2019s campaign had already worked. McCabe announced his retirement.  The Trump administration fired him on Friday not to remove him from government, but to deny him the pension earned for over 20 years of government service. It was an act of punishment, not of personnel management.\n\nThis, then, is part of the cost of Trump\u2019s daily venality: even when his administration makes a decision that might be justifiable on its own terms, the process by which that decision was made cannot be trusted, and may indeed be a scandal in its own right. \n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who serves on the Judiciary Committee, called the McCabe firing \u201cadded evidence of obstruction of justice.\u201d \n\nShould Andrew McCabe have been fired? \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Federal Bureau of Investigation Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, pictured in December.\n      \n      \n        Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nIt\u2019s worth beginning with what McCabe is said to have done wrong. As my colleagues explain:\n\n\nJustice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz found that, in 2016, McCabe inappropriately allowed two top officials to speak to reporters about his decision to open a case into the Clinton Foundation. That incident was under investigation as part of a broader look into how the FBI and Justice Department handled themselves during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBut McCabe apparently lied about his authorization during an interview with the months-long probe. That led the FBI to recommend firing McCabe \u2014 a recommendation Sessions just accepted.\n\n\u201cThe FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability. As the OPR proposal stated, \u2018all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand,\u2019 Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement provided by the Justice Department.\n\n\nMcCabe disputes this interpretation. In his searing statement upon being fired, he wrote:\n\nThe OIG investigation has focused on information I chose to share with a reporter through my public affairs officer and a legal counselor. As Deputy Director, I was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a secret, it took place over several days, and others, including the Director, were aware of the interaction with the reporter. It was the same type of exchange with the media that the Deputy Director oversees several times per week. In fact it was the same type of work that I continued to do under Director Wray, at his request. The investigation subsequently focused on who I talked to, when I talked to them, and so forth. During these inquiries, I answered questions truthfully and as accurately as I could amidst the chaos that surrounded me. And when I thought my answers were misunderstood, I contacted investigators to correct them.\n\nSessions\u2019 explanation of the firing boils down to this line:  \u201cIntegrity is our brand.\u201d The Department of Justice cannot afford even the perception of malfeasance or improper behavior. \n\nBut this is coming from an attorney general who appears to be crossing ethical lines himself in making this decision. Sessions recused himself, in no uncertain terms, from any questions related to the investigations into the Clinton campaign or Russia\u2019s involvement in the 2016 election:\n\n\nMr. Chairman, it was a highly contentious campaign. I, like a lot of people, made comments about the issues in that campaign. With regard to Secretary Clinton and some of the comments I made, I do believe that that could place me objectivity in question. I\u2019ve given that thought.\n\nI believe the proper thing for me to do, would be to recuse myself from any questions involving those kind of investigations that involve Secretary Clinton and that were raised during the campaign or to be otherwise connected to it.\n\n\nBut now Sessions is firing McCabe for activities undeniably related to the Clinton investigation, and after public pressure from Trump, who is explicitly angry at McCabe for activities relating to the Russia investigation, which Sessions is also recused from.\n\nIndeed, Trump has carried out this vendetta with McCabe for months, and done so in public, in harshly personal terms:\n\n\n\nFBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!\n\u2014 Donald J.

Indeed, few believe that. \n\nThe force of the White House was brought down on McCabe because of McCabe\u2019s role overseeing the Russia probe, and because of McCabe\u2019s ties to James Comey, who Trump loathes. Indeed, Trump hasn\u2019t even sought to hide that fact:\n\n\n\nAndrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy.

Sessions angered Trump when he stepped back from the investigations, leaving Trump exposed to inquiries from Robert Mueller. Trump has publicly mocked Sessions for months in what is clearly a pressure campaign to get Sessions to resign. \n\nNow Sessions is making a decision that not only conflicts with his promise to recuse, but is exactly what his boss want from him \u2014 an olive branch to a man who might fire him, and that comes at a time when Trump is known to be looking for administration appointees to fire. Whatever damage McCabe did to the FBI\u2019s brand is nothing compared to the damage Sessions is doing to the Department of Justice\u2019s brand. Who could possibly look at this episode and believe Sessions acted independent of Trump\u2019s pressure? \n\nMcCabe acted improperly enough that it is possible to justify his termination. But Trump and Sessions have acted improperly enough that it is hard to trust the process that led to McCabe\u2019s termination, or to believe that this is anything but what it looks like: an effort to punish and humiliate a perceived political enemy, and to send a message to others who might investigate Trump that they do so at their peril. \n\nThis is the problem with a White House occupied by a vengeful chief executive who has little respect for institutional independence, rule of law, or government transparency.

He warned about the hypothetical threat to the safety of Americans posed by \u201cdangerous criminal aliens,\u201d \u201cset free to prey on innocent Americans.\u201d\n\nBut he didn\u2019t say anything about the actual threat to the safety of innocent Americans posed by Austin\u2019s package bombs.\n\nA president who cared more about trying to reassure all Americans that he was their president regardless of whether they voted for him in 2016 \u2014 or who felt any lingering shame over his response to violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in September 2017, when his insistence on blaming \u201cboth sides\u201d struck many as a defense of neo-Nazis \u2014 might have been particularly quick to condemn attacks that were killing black Americans involved in racial justice. \n\nBut the president \u2014 who, by all reports, is more self-confident and self-reliant than ever, and increasingly convinced that he understands the presidency better than his advisers \u2014 felt no need to do any of that.\n\nThe fourth explosion, which happened Sunday night and injured two cyclists, was similar enough to the previous bombs for investigators to believe the bombings were related, but was triggered by a \u201ctripwire\u201d \u2014 a much more sophisticated form of bomb, and one much harder to avoid. \n\nResidents of the Austin neighborhood where Sunday night\u2019s bomb went off were told not to leave their houses Monday morning so that law enforcement could sweep the area. School buses didn\u2019t go in, and absences were excused.\n\nThe president tweeted about \u201cwitch hunts\u201d instead.\n\nBecause both the cyclists were white and the bomb was in a southwestern Austin neighborhood (which, unlike the east Austin neighborhoods to which the package bombs were addressed, isn\u2019t predominantly black), the latest bombing might complicate the picture of the bomber\u2019s motivations \u2014 though police stress that they\u2019re not ruling out any potential motive right now.\n\nHonestly, that means the window for Trump to say something about Austin without awkward follow-up questions may have already closed. If he speaks out now, he runs the risk of making it look like he only cares now that white people are being harmed. But with each day he remains silent, it begins to look, more and more, like he\u2019s waiting for more information before he decides whether to condemn bombings killing Americans on American soil.\n\nThe residents of Austin deserve to be just as safe and secure as anyone else in the country. If the president really believes that, it\u2019s hard to understand what is keeping him from saying it, or tweeting it.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Andrew Prokop", "body": "Former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe is speaking out. One week after being fired by Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department the day before he was set to retire, McCabe has written an op-ed in the Washington Post with the eye-catching headline: \u201cNot in my worst nightmares did I dream my FBI career would end this way.\u201d\n\nMcCabe\u2019s piece focuses mostly on how he got the news of his firing (he says he saw it on TV before seeing an email in his work account), President Trump\u2019s personal attacks on him (which he calls \u201churtful and false\u201d), and why he joined the FBI in the first place (\u201ca desire to do good\u201d).\n\nAnd this comes amid a PR effort from McCabe and his allies to portray his firing as corrupt. Earlier this week, anonymous sources told ABC News that, early in 2017, McCabe had authorized a criminal probe of Attorney General Jeff Sessions regarding his statements about his contacts with Russian officials during his confirmation hearing. Though the investigation was soon taken over by Robert Mueller, the implication was that McCabe\u2019s firing (ordered by Sessions himself), was hypocritical if not downright retaliatory.\n\nBut we\u2019re still missing a very important part of this story: what, exactly, did McCabe say to the Justice Department\u2019s Inspector General that got him in so much trouble?\n\nThe Department of Justice says McCabe was fired at the recommendation of DOJ\u2019s inspector general, Michael Horowitz \u2014 an Obama appointee who serves as an internal watchdog within the agency. Horowitz has been investigating leaks from the Justice Department and FBI during the 2016 campaign. His investigation started shortly before Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nAnd while Horowitz\u2019s final report has not yet been released, Sessions\u2019s office says the inspector general recommended McCabe\u2019s firing because McCabe \u201cmade an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor \u2014 including under oath \u2014 on multiple occasions.\u201d \n\nMcCabe\u2019s op-ed is vague and unconvincing on what exactly happened here, dealing with it in just a single paragraph that claims that \u201cbecause of what was going on around\u201d him, he \u201cmay well have been confused and distracted\u201d when answering the inspector general\u2019s questions, and given answers that were \u201cnot fully accurate.\u201d\n\nBut this is no minor matter. It\u2019s crucial in determining what to make of McCabe\u2019s dismissal. It\u2019s entirely possible that, despite Trump\u2019s treatment of McCabe being indeed incredibly unprofessional and worrying, McCabe\u2019s statements to the IG really were egregious. \u201cLacking candor\u201d to an inspector general, \u201cincluding under oath, on multiple occasions\u201d is quite bad and probably firing-worthy, if that is indeed what happened. \n\nAnd what we already know McCabe did is questionable enough itself.\n\nMcCabe leaked information about the FBI\u2019s Clinton Foundation investigation to a reporter just days before the 2016 election\nOn October 24, 2016, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Devlin Barrett published a story that got an enormous amount of attention on the right. The story revealed that McCabe\u2019s wife had run for Virginia state senate in 2015, and that Virginia\u2019s Democratic governor, the longtime Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe, raised funds for her campaign. Barrett also pointed out that McCabe had a role overseeing the Clinton email investigation. (Trump would later cite this information repeatedly, both in public and private, as showing McCabe\u2019s supposed corruption.)\n\nLess than a week later, on October 30, Barrett published another Journal story. His sources describe, in some detail, interactions McCabe was said to have had with Obama Justice Department officials about an investigation of the Clinton Foundation. It portrays McCabe as heroically trying to keep this investigation moving forward, over an unnamed Justice Department official\u2019s resistance.\n\nThe October 30 article was based on leaks  \u2014 leaks that described internal deliberations about an ongoing investigation tied to a major party presidential nominee, and coming just days before the presidential election. And these leaks were clearly designed to rehabilitate damage to McCabe and the FBI\u2019s reputation. They are a key focus of the inspector general\u2019s investigation. \n\nAnd they were, in fact, leaks initiated by McCabe \u2014 in a statement McCabe released the night of his firing, he admitted as much. He claimed the leaks were authorized \u201cunder FBI rules,\u201d and tried to portray his actions in a sympathetic light. He wrote:\n\n\nI was being portrayed in the media over and over as a political partisan, accused of closing down investigations under political pressure. The FBI was portrayed as caving under that pressure, and making decisions for political rather than law enforcement purposes. Nothing was further from the truth. In fact, this entire investigation stems from my efforts, fully authorized under FBI rules, to set the record straight on behalf of the Bureau and to make it clear that we were continuing an investigation that people in DOJ opposed.\n\nThe OIG investigation has focused on information I chose to share with a reporter through my public affairs officer and a legal counselor. As Deputy Director, I was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a secret, it took place over several days, and others, including the Director, were aware of the interaction with the reporter. It was the same type of exchange with the media that the Deputy Director oversees several times per week.\n\n\nThe less sympathetic interpretation would be that McCabe chose to leak his version of internal deliberations about an ongoing investigation tied to the Democratic presidential nominee to try and make himself and/or the FBI look better at the expense of Obama\u2019s Justice Department, because he was annoyed at an earlier story that made him look bad. And \u2014 again \u2014 that he chose to do this just days before the presidential election.\n\nThe Justice Department claims McCabe didn\u2019t fess up about his role in these leaks\nOn January 12, 2017 \u2014 a little over a week before Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2014 Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz announced that he\u2019d open a review of \u201callegations regarding certain actions\u201d by the Justice Department and FBI \u201cin advance of the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nThe review was broad. It included then-FBI director James Comey\u2019s decisions to speak publicly about the Clinton email case, allegations that McCabe should have recused himself from Clinton investigations, and, more vaguely, \u201callegations that Department and FBI employees improperly disclosed non-public information,\u201d among other matters.\n\nWe are still awaiting Horowitz\u2019s final report. But we know that he or his investigators interviewed McCabe about that Wall Street Journal leak. And Horowitz is said to have concluded McCabe\u2019s answers were firing-worthy.\n\n\u201cThe investigation subsequently focused on who I talked to, when I talked to them, and so forth,\u201d McCabe said in his statement last week. \u201cDuring these inquiries, I answered questions truthfully and as accurately as I could amidst the chaos that surrounded me. And when I thought my answers were misunderstood, I contacted investigators to correct them.\u201d\n\nIn his new Post op-ed, he continues in this vein:\n\nI have been accused of \u201clack of candor.\u201d That is not true. I did not knowingly mislead or lie to investigators. When asked about contacts with a reporter that were fully within my power to authorize as deputy director, and amid the chaos that surrounded me, I answered questions as completely and accurately as I could. And when I realized that some of my answers were not fully accurate or may have been misunderstood, I took the initiative to correct them. At worst, I was not clear in my responses, and because of what was going on around me may well have been confused and distracted \u2014 and for that I take full responsibility. But that is not a lack of candor. \n\nTo be blunt: many now defending McCabe would roundly mock a Trump ally citing a similar excuse for making misstatements to investigators. He gave \u201cnot fully accurate\u201d answers because he was \u201cconfused\u201d and \u201cdistracted\u201d because of \u201cwhat was going on around\u201d him? \n\nIn any case, the competing claims are essentially as follows. The Justice Department says the IG found McCabe lacked candor on multiple occasions, including under oath, and that this was serious enough to merit his firing. McCabe says he unintentionally gave \u201cnot fully accurate\u201d answers to the IG, but that he didn\u2019t mean to and later tried to correct the record. \n\nNeither of these competing claims gets into specifics about what McCabe said and why, exactly, it wasn\u2019t accurate. The Inspector General\u2019s report will. And it could complicate the narrative among Trump\u2019s critics that McCabe was corruptly pushed out.\n\nIt is certainly true that, as Ezra Klein and others write, Trump wanted McCabe gone for reasons having nothing to do with the IG\u2019s investigation, and that members of Congress were also calling for McCabe\u2019s head for largely political reasons. Still, this IG investigation was initiated by an Obama appointee, before Trump\u2019s inauguration. And IGs traditionally proceed with a good amount of independence \u2014 they are the internal watchdogs charged with keeping departments honest. \n\nIf Horowitz truly did recommend McCabe\u2019s firing as a result of some damning findings, Sessions was probably justified in carrying out that recommendation. Alternatively, it\u2019s of course possible that Horowitz could have overreached. But it seems we\u2019ll have to wait for his report to get some specifics of what actually happened when McCabe spoke to the IG.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "German Lopez", "body": "Gun control is, broadly speaking, incredibly popular in America. Polling for many common gun control measures, including universal background checks, can top 75 percent \u2014 even among Republicans.\n\nSo why can\u2019t it get through Congress?\n\nThe best explanation seems to be issue intensity. Essentially, lots of Americans support gun control, but it\u2019s not really their top priority when they go out to vote. Meanwhile, those who oppose stricter gun laws are simply more likely to make it the one issue they\u2019ll vote on.\n\nThis was articulated by Republican strategist Grover Norquist back in 2000. He said, \u201cThe question is intensity versus preference. You can always get a certain percentage to say they are in favor of some gun controls. But are they going to vote on their \u2018control\u2019 position?\u201d Probably not, he suggested, \u201cbut for that 4-5 percent who care about guns, they will vote on this.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what makes movements like the March for Our Lives \u2014 and much of the activism that\u2019s followed the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, which killed 17 \u2014 so important. For once, we are seeing a mass movement that is extremely dedicated to gun control. It seems to be an issue that the movement\u2019s leaders are ready to go all-in on. And by attracting so much national attention, the movement may inspire other Americans to follow suit \u2014 making gun control an issue that can actually sway votes. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say the March for Our Lives and related movements will ultimately succeed \u2014 it\u2019s just too soon to tell. But as thousands of protesters take to the streets in Washington, DC, and the rest of the country on Saturday, the movement\u2019s apparent potential to promote and boost issue intensity on gun control could ultimately make it pivotal.\n\nSome gun control measures are extremely popular, even among Republicans\nCongress\u2019s inaction on guns over the past few years is not due to the unpopularity of gun control measures. If you look at the polling, support for gun control, depending on which specific measure respondents are asked about, can be very high among both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nHere, for example, are the results of surveys by the Pew Research Center, which found strong support for measures ranging from an assault weapons ban to universal background checks to restrictions on people with mental illness buying guns:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nWhat\u2019s remarkable about the polling is how much of it reflects bipartisan support for new gun control measures. A majority of Republicans back universal background checks, a ban on assault-style weapons, a federal database to track gun sales, prohibitions on people with mental illness, and barring people on no-fly or watch lists from buying firearms. In fact, GOP support for three of these policies tops 75 percent.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Republicans agree with all gun control measures. And a majority back measures that gun control proponents oppose, including allowing concealed carry in more places, shortening waiting periods for buying guns legally, and arming teachers. \n\nBut there\u2019s a lot of remarkable middle ground \u2014 one that you wouldn\u2019t know of if you just looked at Congress\u2019s record passing new restrictions on firearms.\n\nIssue intensity is the key\nThis is where issue intensity comes in. Consider this chart, also from Pew:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nAbout 21 percent of gun owners have contacted a public official to express an opinion on gun policy, compared to just 12 percent of non-gun owners. And about 22 percent of people who want less strict gun laws have contacted a public official, while just 15 percent of people who support stricter laws have.\n\nThe differences are more pronounced if you look at contact in the previous 12 months. Gun owners are 80 percent more likely than non-gun owners to have contacted a public official about gun policy in the past year. And supporters of laxer gun laws are nearly 60 percent more likely than supporters of stricter gun laws to have contacted a public official over the issue in the same time span.\n\nThis difference in issue intensity also shows up in other areas. Take this second chart:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nAgain, the situation is skewed in favor of gun owners. About 28 percent of gun owners have contributed to an organization that takes a position on gun policy, while only 10 percent of non-gun owners have. That helps explain how a group like the National Rifle Association (NRA) has become so powerful, while there are no political equivalents \u2014 in terms of influence \u2014 on the other side.\n\nOne caveat to the charts: Based on Pew\u2019s surveys, there are way more adults in the US who believe that gun laws should be stricter (52 percent) than those who believe gun laws should be less strict (18 percent). So the side in favor of stricter gun laws can afford to have a lower percentage of its people contacting public officials.\n\nIt\u2019s demonstrative, though, to focus on the 12-month data for this. As it shows, gun owners and supporters of laxer gun laws are more likely to have recently engaged a public official or political organization on this issue. That matters: If a senator gets phone calls every few months from gun owners and opponents of stricter laws, that\u2019s going to make a bigger impression than calls from non-gun owners and supporters of stricter laws every year or so.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true if you consider political party. Republicans are much more likely to oppose stricter laws, based on Pew\u2019s data. So if a Republican senator mostly hears from GOP constituents, and these constituents are more likely to be really passionate about the issue since they are on the side that opposes stricter laws, that\u2019s going to give the senator a skewed perception of where voters are on this topic. As a result, Republican lawmakers are more resistant to calls for gun control \u2014 arguing against \u201cpoliticizing\u201d mass shootings and focusing on issues like mental health instead.\n\nSo why the difference in passion? Kristin Goss, a political scientist at Duke University and author of The Gun Debate: What Everyone Needs to Know, previously told me that it\u2019s a sense of tangible loss. Gun owners feel like the government is going to take their guns and rights. \n\nThis sentiment has been fueled by a decades-long public campaign by the NRA to convince the US public and politicians that, in fact, the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms, and that more guns will actually make people safer (by letting them protect themselves), despite research that shows higher levels of gun ownership actually lead to more gun violence.\n\nGun control advocates, meanwhile, are motivated by more abstract notions of reducing gun violence \u2014 although, Goss noted, the victims of mass shootings and their families have begun putting a face on these policies. \n\nThat\u2019s exactly what the current protests are doing, with student survivors from Florida in particular actively participating and showing the human, personal cost of unabated gun violence in a very public manner. Success isn\u2019t guaranteed. But the potential to inspire more widespread and passionate empathy and sympathy through these demonstrations could crack the key problem facing the gun control movement today.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Alex Ward", "body": "Gina Haspel \u2014 a CIA operative who oversaw the torture of two terrorism suspects at a secret prison in Thailand and then helped destroy tapes of the interrogations \u2014 will likely be the next CIA director.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced a major shakeup in his national security team: Rex Tillerson is out as secretary of state, CIA Director Mike Pompeo heads over to lead the State Department, and Haspel \u2014 the CIA\u2019s deputy director \u2014 will replace Pompeo as the head of the intelligence agency.\n\nIf confirmed, Haspel would be the first woman to lead the CIA. She\u2019s widely respected in intelligence circles and has spent over 30 years in the CIA, where she was undercover for most of that time. But she remains a controversial figure for her years-long involvement in a wider CIA program that led to the torture of dozens of suspects, which included stuffing people into coffins or depriving them of sleep.\n\nDespite this, Trump clearly has confidence in Haspel, and she says she\u2019s ready for her new role. \u201cI am grateful to President Trump for the opportunity, and humbled by his confidence in me, to be nominated to be the next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency,\u201d Haspel said in a statement after the president\u2019s announcement.\n\nWhatever reservations Trump may have had about torture, he\u2019s set them aside to promote Haspel to lead one of America\u2019s most famous agencies.\n\nHaspel\u2019s long history with torture\nHaspel ran the CIA\u2019s detention site in Thailand, the agency\u2019s first overseas secret prison.\n\nIt was there, in 2002, that she oversaw the interrogation of two terrorism suspects. One was Abu Zubaydah, who according to the New Yorker \u201cwas tortured so brutally that at one point he appeared to be dead.\u201d CIA operatives reportedly waterboarded Zubaydah 83 times and repeatedly slammed him into walls. \n\nThe other, Abd al Rahim al-Nashiri, was also waterboarded in 2002 and is currently being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nThe CIA also videotaped the torture. The 92 tapes were held in a safe until the agency asked for their destruction in 2005. Haspel, who then worked out of Langley overseeing the CIA\u2019s torture program, had her name on the cable that ordered their eradication. However, the CIA said at the time that Haspel\u2019s boss, Jose Rodriguez, made the call. The Justice Department investigated the tape-destruction order but ultimately filed no charges.\n\nPresident Barack Obama ordered the closure of CIA black sites in 2009, but it\u2019s unclear if Haspel\u2019s nomination means they\u2019ll make a comeback. Trump previously advocated for the return of torture against terrorism suspects until Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis convinced the president otherwise.\n\nHaspel \u2014 who may get a lot of face time with the president delivering his daily intelligence briefing \u2014 may have the chance to change Trump\u2019s mind on this controversial issue.\n\nHaspel has her detractors\nWhen Pompeo announced Haspel as his deputy in February 2017, civil rights advocates widely criticized her appointment. \n\n\u201cPompeo must explain to the American people how his promotion of someone allegedly involved in running a torture site squares with his own sworn promises to Congress that he will reject all forms of torture and abuse,\u201d Christopher Anders of the American Civil Liberties Union told CBS News last year.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and other Senate Democrats protested her appointment to the CIA\u2019s No. 2 job last year. And Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), who once led the committee, blocked Haspel\u2019s promotion to lead the CIA\u2019s clandestine operations because of her role in the torture program and involvement in the destruction of the tapes.\n\nBut even former Obama intelligence officials have previously praised Haspel. When Pompeo named her as his deputy director, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said he was \u201cvery pleased,\u201d and former acting CIA Director Mike Morell said \u201cI applaud the appointment.\u201d\n\nAs of now, there is no indication that the GOP-controlled Senate will block Haspel\u2019s nomination, which has yet to be scheduled. But it\u2019s likely that she will prove a divisive figure in an administration already filled with controversial leaders.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Ezra Klein", "body": "When assessing news made by President Donald Trump, the first question is: Does it matter? \n\nTrump\u2019s statements are more extreme than those made by his predecessors, but they are less predictive of policy than those of past presidents. This is how Washington has come to calm itself over these past 24 months. Yes, what the president of the United States just said might be alarming, but the president says lots of alarming things, and he rarely follows through. \n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s management style is such that he likes to say what\u2019s on his mind,\u201d Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) told Vox. \u201cHe grows anxious when he has an unexpressed thought. It\u2019s not a criticism; it\u2019s just the way he is. He likes to say, \u2018Here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.\u2019 But you have to judge him by what he does.\u201d\n\nBetween what Trump says and what he does is his staff. The executive bureaucracy is a sprawling machine that takes time to understand and effort to work. Trump has not committed himself to the task of mastery, or even of comprehension. This has been a relief to his allies, who take comfort in their many opportunities to let his impulses dissipate before they become calamities. Trump is also famously responsive to the last person he spoke to, a reflection of his loose grasp of the issues he faces. He knows what he feels better than he knows what he wants. \n\nFor these reasons, though, the news that truly matters in Trumpland is staffing, and there, the news is grim. The replacement of H.R. McMaster with former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton takes a reckless, confrontational president and ensconces him in an informational architecture that will now be erected by a reckless, confrontational national security adviser. \n\n\u201cThis is by far the most important national security position in our government,\u201d writes Kelly Magsamen, vice president for national security and international policy at the liberal Center for American Progress. \u201cWhy? Because this person is the one in charge of shaping and framing national security decisions for the President.\u201d\n\nNor is it just McMaster leaving the administration and being replaced by a more Trumpist figure. Recent weeks have seen the exits of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn. Both men were replaced by more extreme candidates. \n\nTrump also fired his lawyer John Dowd on Thursday, a move that the New Yorker\u2019s legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin believes \u201csubstantially increases the chances that the President will move to fire [special counsel Robert] Mueller \u2014 perhaps very soon.\u201d \n\nHope Hicks is likely to be replaced as communications director by Kellyanne Conway, whose famous coining of the term \u201calternative facts\u201d speaks to how little emphasis she places on ensuring the information that gets to the president or out from the White House is rigorously checked and accurately sourced. \n\nChief of Staff John Kelly\u2019s job is imperiled too. Trump is tired of Kelly\u2019s gatekeeping and attempts to keep order, so he\u2019s musing about firing Kelly and managing the White House himself. \n\nAll this is likely to lead to a cycle of immoderation ripping through the White House staff. As the ranks of the moderates thin, the jobs of the remaining moderates become more grueling and hopeless. Already, Bolton is spoiling for a fight with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who is widely seen as a key moderating force on Trump. \u201cSources who know Bolton expect he will stare down Mattis, tell him when he\u2019s wrong, and will be a Henry Kissinger-type presence in the room,\u201d reports Mike Allen. \u201cNow that Tillerson is gone, he could fundamentally tip the balance of power on Trump\u2019s national security team, senior officials expect.\u201d \n\nWorking in the Trump administration is difficult in the best of circumstances, and Mattis has been doing it since day one. But the ranks of his allies are waning, and Trump is evidently chafing under the restraints of his staff. How long will Mattis want to continue in his role? How long will he be allowed to continue in his role?\n\nBut as Trump surrounds himself with staff who amplify his tendency toward confrontation and escalation, the likelihood that Trump\u2019s instincts will become his policies grows. And that means it\u2019s entirely possible that 12 months from now, America will be embroiled in a trade war with China and Europe, in military conflict with North Korea, and managing the aftermath of Mueller\u2019s termination. \n\nIf year one of the Trump era was marked by the relief that so few of the president\u2019s opinions became official policy, year two may be defined by the catastrophes that follow a reckless leader unleashing his impulses upon the world. \n\nFurther reading:\n\u2022 Vox\u2019s John Bolton explainer. Here\u2019s the key graf: \u201cBolton has said the United States should declare war on both North Korea and Iran. He was credibly accused of manipulating US intelligence on weapons of mass destruction prior to the Iraq War and of abusive treatment of his subordinates. He once \u2018joked\u2019 about knocking 10 stories off the UN building in New York. That means his new appointment to be the most important national security official in the White House has significant \u2014 and frightening \u2014 implications for Trump\u2019s approach to the world.\u201d \n\n\u2022 The New York Times adds: \u201cMr. Bolton will almost surely encourage Mr. Trump\u2019s instincts against diplomatic agreements both consider weak and unwise. He shares the president\u2019s derisive opinion of the Iran nuclear deal and will presumably prod him to scrap it when a May deadline arrives. He likewise takes a dim view of international agreements like the Paris climate change accord, from which Mr. Trump announced last year that he would withdraw the United States. He has called the \u2018two-state solution\u2019 for Israel and the Palestinians dead.\u201d\n\n\u2022 At the American Conservative, Gareth Porter dives into Bolton\u2019s machinations toward Iran: \u201cBolton\u2019s high-profile advocacy of war with Iran is well known. What is not at all well known is that, when he was under secretary of state for arms control and international security, he executed a complex and devious strategy aimed at creating the justification for a U.S. attack on Iran.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The (not-that-)wayback machine: Remember when Donald Trump thought George W. Bush\u2019s hawkish advisers had discredited themselves after the disaster of the Iraq War? Trump\u2019s Twitter account does. \n\n\u2022 This is concerning context, particularly given what we know of Trump\u2019s personality: \u201cAs the economist Daniel Kahneman and the political scientist Jonathan Renshon have written, \u2018a bias in favor of hawkish beliefs and preferences is built into the fabric of the human mind.\u2019 The arguments of hawkish advisers often play into policymakers\u2019 psychological biases and shortcuts \u2014 such as over-optimism about potential conflicts, or the aversion to cutting losses. As a result, in debates about war, decision-makers are more likely to listen to hawks than doves.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Max Boot: \u201cMost presidents initially stock their administrations with cronies and ideological purists. Then, after suffering inevitable setbacks, they usher them out in favor of less ideological and more competent professionals. President Trump is doing it in reverse. He is jettisoning anyone who could serve as a break on his extremist tendencies, and replacing them with fire-breathing TV personalities.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Alex Ward", "body": "The Trump administration has spent months attacking former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe. Now, McCabe has been fired 26 hours before his formal retirement \u2014 a move that could cost him his federal pension.\n\nOn Friday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced  McCabe\u2019s ouster from the FBI. McCabe had planned to leave for good on March 18 after a storied 21-year career, but Sessions decided to push him out the door early.\n\nHere\u2019s why: Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz found that, in 2016, McCabe inappropriately allowed two top officials to speak to reporters about his decision to open a case into the Clinton Foundation. That incident was was under investigation as part of a broader look into how the FBI and Justice Department handled themselves during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBut McCabe apparently lied about his authorization during an interview with the months-long probe. That led the FBI to recommend firing McCabe \u2014 a recommendation Sessions just accepted. \n\n\u201cThe FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability.  As the OPR proposal stated, \u2018all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand,\u2019 Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement provided by the Justice Department.\n\n\u201cPursuant to Department Order 1202, and based on the report of the Inspector General, the findings of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility, and the recommendation of the Department\u2019s senior career official, I have terminated the employment of Andrew McCabe effective immediately,\u201d the statement read.\n\nMcCabe had resigned from his post as the deputy director of the FBI after being publicly attacked for months by Trump and other top administration officials. He stepped away from his responsibilities, however, hoping to wait to leave until his retirement date. McCabe will now lose his pension.\n\nIn response to his dismissal, McCabe released a fiery statement. \u201cI am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey,\u201d he said in a statement. \n\n\u201cThis attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally. It is part of this Administration\u2019s ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel investigation, which continue to this day. Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the Special Counsel\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nThe president and his supporters, meanwhile, will surely celebrate. Trump\u2019s fury goes back to a long-running controversy over McCabe\u2019s wife\u2019s allegedly compromising political ties to Hillary Clinton. In 2015, McCabe\u2019s wife ran for a state Senate seat in Virginia, backed in part with money provided by the state Democratic party and a Clinton ally. Trump and other Republicans have used the Justice Department probe against McCabe to argue he was secretly harboring an anti-Trump agenda.\n\nMcCabe\u2019s name also surfaced in a controversial text message sent by FBI agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe over evidence of anti-Trump political bias. \n\nStrzok had mentioned someone named \u201cAndy\u201d in a text message with federal attorney Lisa Page, suggesting there was a discussion about Trump \u2014 and not a positive one \u2014 in McCabe\u2019s office. Page, it turns out, was one of the officials who spoke to the Journal with McCabe\u2019s blessing.\n\nTrump, clearly irked, openly campaigned for Sessions to remove McCabe. \n\n\n\nWhy didn't A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation but got....\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017\n\n\n\n\nOther prominent Republicans outright called for McCabe\u2019s firing too. \u201cHe oughta be replaced. And I\u2019ve said that before and I\u2019ve said it to people who can do it,\u201d Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), the Judiciary Committee chairman, told reporters in December.\n\nThe question now is if McCabe\u2019s firing will strengthen the broader GOP-led movement to discredit federal law enforcement over allegations that it is corruptly anti-Trump. But what\u2019s clear is that the president and his allies hoped McCabe would face a stiff penalty \u2014 and they finally got their wish.\n\nThis could put more pressure on the Trump-Russia probe\nMcCabe\u2019s firing might have a far-reaching impact on Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nWhen Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on May 9, McCabe became acting FBI director. All of a sudden, a man that the president believed worked against him was in charge of (among other things) the probe into the Trump campaign\u2019s connections to Russia.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take too long for Trump to make his anger with this development known. On July 26, 2017, he called on Attorney General Sessions to fire McCabe. This level of presidential involvement in FBI personnel decisions is highly unusual, especially given the lack of concrete evidence of McCabe\u2019s guilt.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t alone in hating the Mueller probe. A growing number of congressional GOP members and right-wing commentators continuously call for Mueller\u2019s dismissal for similar reasons: that is, his perceived bias against Trump. The evidence of such, though, is thin.\n\nThe efforts are part of a broader GOP ploy to paint the Justice Department as hopelessly biased against Trump. The likely aim is to soften the blow of any potential charges against the president or his associates that come out of the Mueller probe.\n\nIn that context, McCabe\u2019s firing sends a chilling message: Draw the president\u2019s ire, especially by investigating him, and you might be publicly humiliated \u2014 and then lose the pension you\u2019ve spent decades accumulating.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matthew Yglesias", "body": "Democrat Linda Belcher was just pronounced the winner of the special election in Kentucky\u2019s House District 49, a seat that Donald Trump carried by a 72-23 margin in 2016 and that went 66-33 for Mitt Romney in 2012. \n\nHer 68-32 victory represents an insane 45-point improvement on Hillary Clinton\u2019s performance. In fuller context, it\u2019s a little less insane than that. She had previously represented this district in the state legislature, lost a very narrow 50.4-49.6 race in 2016, then the man who defeated, Dan Johnson, committed suicide while under a cloud of sexual assault allegations. The GOP nominated Johnson\u2019s widow and Belcher reclaimed her old seat. \n\nStill, Belcher improved by 18 points on her own margin from just 15 months ago \u2014 a very clear sign of Democrats\u2019 down ballot recovery in the Trump era. \n\nDemocrats are cleaning up in special elections\nAccording to an extremely useful comprehensive spreadsheet compiled by Daily Kos, across 70 special elections in 2017, Democrats ran 10 points ahead of Clinton and 7 points ahead of Obama\u2019s 2012 results. Those numbers have accelerated into 2018. Across 14 races, Democrats are running 28 points ahead of Clinton and 14 points ahead of Obama. \n\nHistorically speaking, special election results usually are somewhat predictive of midterm general election outcomes, though I don\u2019t think anyone believes it\u2019s realistic for Democrats to obtain a nationwide 45-point swing relative to Clinton\u2019s numbers. \n\nMeanwhile, the special elections are already having real-world impact. \n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has decided to leave a number of formerly GOP-held seats vacant rather than schedule special elections his party might lose, national Republicans are pushing the panic button on an upcoming special House election in Pennsylvania, and GOP leadership is letting scandal-plagued Rep.

But liberals fear that a recent trend of Trump proving willing to resist advisers who counsel caution will finally lead to him pulling the trigger \u2014 and that he\u2019ll get away with it, since a sycophantic Republican Congress would likely take little action in response.\n\nYet it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that even though Trump has wanted Mueller gone and his investigation shut down for at least nine months \u2014 by one account, Trump actually tried to push Mueller out last June \u2014 he\u2019s been either reticent or unable to actually make it happen so far. And it\u2019s worth understanding the several reasons why that is.\n\nThe process of getting rid of Mueller is much more complicated and legally fraught than, say, firing FBI Director James Comey or Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Furthermore, dismissing Mueller himself wouldn\u2019t end Mueller\u2019s investigation \u2014 an even more controversial intervention would be required for that. Then, even if he pulled it off, Mueller\u2019s firing would likely lead to a flood of leaks. Finally, the ensuing backlash could help Democrats regain control of Congress \u2014 which could make Trump\u2019s legal and political situation even worse.\n\nIt is certainly possible that Trump could change his mind and decide that, despite all this, Mueller\u2019s probe is so dangerous that it\u2019s worth casting caution to the wind and firing him. But he\u2019s been afraid to take that step so far \u2014 and for some very good reasons.\n\n1) Firing Mueller would be much more procedurally complicated and legally challenging than firing Comey or Tillerson\nLast week, President Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with a tweet. Last May, he fired FBI Director James Comey with a signed letter. Both men served at the president\u2019s pleasure \u2014 all the president had to do was say the word, and they were gone.\n\nThings aren\u2019t so simple with Mueller. The special counsel was appointed under a Justice Department regulation that sets restrictions on just how and why he can be fired. \n\nThe how, in this case, is by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (since his boss Jeff Sessions recused himself). Rosenstein appointed Mueller, and according to the regulation, he\u2019s the only person who can fire him.\n\nThen there\u2019s the why, which is also very important here. The regulation states that a special counsel can\u2019t be fired on a whim. Instead, it says, he or she can only be fired for \u201cmisconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause.\u201d \n\nIf Trump truly was hell-bent on dumping Mueller, these problems probably wouldn\u2019t be insurmountable. But the solutions aren\u2019t pretty \u2014 they all involve either more firings or some questionable legal claims.\n\nRegarding the why, the regulation does say a special counsel can be fired for \u201cconflict of interest\u201d \u2014 which may explain some of Trump\u2019s recent tweets:\n\n\n\nA total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 19, 2018\n\n\n\n\nPublicly and privately, Trump and his allies have floated several alleged conflicts that they think could be used to justify ousting Mueller \u2014 ranging from Mueller\u2019s past working relationship with Comey to a years-old Mueller request for a dues refund from Trump National Golf Club. Legal experts don\u2019t seem particularly convinced by these, and Trump\u2019s own White House counsel Don McGahn reportedly refused to order Mueller\u2019s firing based on these pretexts last year. But a hackish enough Trump Justice appointee could cite them as an excuse for the firing.\n\nThe trickier question is the how, considering Rosenstein has repeatedly said he sees no good cause for firing Mueller and has testified that he wouldn\u2019t carry out an order to do so unless he saw good cause. \n\nThere are several ways Trump could get around this, though.\n\n\nTrump could fire Rosenstein and whoever replaces Rosenstein in the Justice Department\u2019s line of succession until he finds someone willing to dismiss Mueller.\nAnother path would be through firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Theoretically, a new attorney general would not be recused from overseeing the Russia investigation like Sessions was, and would replace Rosenstein as Mueller\u2019s boss. However, a permanent attorney general appointee would need to be confirmed by the narrowly divided Senate.\nTrump could also evade both the Justice Department\u2019s line of succession and Senate confirmation by exploiting a little-known law called the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. With it, he could appoint a temporary replacement for Sessions or Rosenstein who\u2019s already been confirmed by the Senate for some other post elsewhere in the government. (Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has been rumored as one possibility.) Whoever this stooge is could then dump Mueller.\nTrump could also rescind the regulation establishing the special counsel\u2019s office altogether \u2014 but revoking a regulation is a lengthy and complex process.\nFinally, he could make a broad executive power claim that he has the power to fire Mueller on his own. But that could lead to a showdown with his own Justice Department (Rosenstein has testified he believes only he can fire Mueller), and would likely end up in court.\n\nAgain \u2014 if Trump wants Mueller gone enough, he can probably make it happen. The point is that getting there would be far uglier and look far more corrupt than even the firing of Comey.\n\n2) Firing Mueller does not mean ending the Mueller investigation\nAll of that lengthy preceding section was just about the complexities of firing Robert S. Mueller III, the person. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t even begin to address another problem Trump would have to solve \u2014 that is, how to end Mueller\u2019s investigation. \n\nCurrently, 17 prosecutors are working under Mueller in the special counsel\u2019s office. They\u2019re working with many FBI agents. They\u2019ve convened at least two grand juries (in Washington, DC, and Alexandria, Virginia). They have live indictments against Paul Manafort (in two jurisdictions) and against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies. Mueller\u2019s team has also banked guilty pleas from five people who have not yet been sentenced. There could even be sealed indictments we don\u2019t know about (George Papadopoulos\u2019s indictment was sealed for months).\n\nFiring Mueller would not make all this vanish. For that, a more proactive cover-up would be necessary. Trump\u2019s hypothetical stooge at the Justice Department would have to not just be willing to dismiss Mueller, but to affirmatively act to shut down (or at least, rein in) his investigation. \n\nAgain, this is something that Trump probably could make happen should he be willing to bear the political consequences. For instance, he could have his Justice Department stooge appoint a crony as a replacement special counsel for Mueller, who will make sure the investigation progresses no further. But it\u2019s yet another step up in difficulty and controversy from just firing one person.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth remembering that President Richard Nixon failed at this stage of the cover-up process. He fired his top Justice Department officials until he found one who\u2019d get rid of the special prosecutor investigating Watergate. But then that Justice official (Robert Bork) appointed a new special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, who ended up investigating the case vigorously.\n\n3) Firing Mueller would unleash the leaks\nIn 10 months of subpoenas, evidence collection, reviews of intelligence intercepts, and witness testimonies, Mueller\u2019s team has gathered an enormous amount of information on the Trump campaign, business, transition, and White House. (For instance, he obtained the full transition team email accounts of 13 Trump aides.)\n\nWe don\u2019t know how much of what they have relates to potential criminality, or how much might just be politically damaging were it to become public. But it sure seems likely that,  should Trump make a corrupt-looking attempt to shut down Mueller\u2019s investigation, lots of this information would find its way to congressional Democrats or to the media.\n\nRecall what happened when Trump fired Comey back in May \u2014 over the ensuing weeks, a remarkable series of bombshell leaks occurred. They were about events both old (Trump\u2019s inappropriate request for Comey\u2019s \u201cloyalty\u201d at a private meeting, his later request that Comey end the investigation into Michael Flynn, and Jared Kushner\u2019s seeking a back channel to communicate with Russia during the transition) and new (Trump\u2019s revelation of classified intelligence to Russian officials in an Oval Office meeting). \n\nMueller\u2019s probe has been remarkably leak-proof so far. Should the probe be shut down in what looks like a corrupt manner, it seems unlikely that would continue. At least some law enforcement officials would likely prove more willing to take the legal risks for leaking, should they feel it\u2019s the only way to prevent a cover-up. And of course, the leaks after Comey\u2019s firing were eventually followed by Mueller\u2019s appointment.\n\n4) A Trump cover-up could improve Democrats\u2019 chances of retaking Congress \u2014 which would worsen the president\u2019s legal woes\nIt\u2019s well understood that Trump would face a political backlash for firing Mueller. In and of itself, that probably wouldn\u2019t be enough to hold him back from doing it \u2014 after all, he\u2019s been willing and even eager to make controversial political moves in the past.\n\nBut the real risk for Trump is in what that political backlash could make likely \u2014 a Democratic takeover of one or both chambers of Congress in 2018.\n\nAlready, the national environment is worrying for Republicans. The president is unpopular. Democrats lead by 9 points in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s average of congressional generic ballot polls. And Democrats have been consistently bettering their 2016 performance in special elections. The enormous controversy that would result from a shutdown of the Mueller investigation could supercharge all this.\n\nThe problem for Trump is not that he\u2019d be sentimental about the GOP\u2019s electoral fate. It\u2019s that Democratic control of even one chamber would unleash empowered opposition party\u2013controlled investigations into him and his administration on Russia, obstruction, and a host of other issues.\n\nThat is to say, firing Mueller could help Democrats retake Congress, and end up landing Trump in far more investigative hot water and political jeopardy.\n\nTrump could well calculate that despite all this, Mueller\u2019s investigation is dangerous enough to himself, his family, or his allies in the near term that it\u2019s worth taking the enormous risk of shutting it down.\n\nBut anyone who thinks firing Mueller would make Trump\u2019s legal problems go away is badly mistaken. Instead, it would be the beginning of a new and far more serious crisis \u2014 with no end in sight.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jane Coaston", "body": "After President Donald Trump\u2019s surprise announcement on Thursday that he had agreed to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, some conservatives wondered why they were abandoning the position they took with President Barack Obama. \n\nObama\u2019s comments in 2008 and 2009 about talking to strong men \u201cwithout preconditions,\u201d and his efforts to work with both North Korea and Cuba\u2019s communist governments were greeted by conservatives with scorn. So it seemed odd to some on the right that Trump doing the same was being f\u00eated as a victory for American foreign policy. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not certain why meeting with Kim without preconditions is suddenly a grand coup when we would have gone nuts had Obama done the same,\u201d said conservative pundit Ben Shapiro, who criticized Obama back in 2009 and is now often critical of Trump. \n\nNational Review\u2019s Jim Geraghty wondered the same. \u201cRemember how much we condemned then-senator Barack Obama\u2019s pledge to \u2018meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries?\u2019 That wasn\u2019t wrong,\u201d Geraghty wrote. \n\nIt\u2019s unclear what Trump\u2019s meeting will consist of, or what it means for America\u2019s foreign policy strategy with regards to North Korea \u2014 since last night\u2019s announcement, the administration has walked back some of Trump\u2019s statements and tried to make it clear that the meeting, scheduled to perhaps take place before May, should not be read as a negotiation or an agreement, or a move towards demilitarization on the Korean peninsula.\n\nWhile some Republicans are giving Trump the benefit of the doubt, Trump is also keeping up his recent streak of riling up his allies, whether it\u2019s on guns or tariffs or, now, North Korea. \n\nWhy conservatives don\u2019t like meetings with strong men\nShapiro told me that by Trump agreeing to meet with Kim, North Korea had already achieved a victory. \u201cKim is looking for legitimacy; Trump just gave it to him as a presumed co-equal on the world stage.\u201d He added, \u201cIf Trump is the greatest dealmaker ever, then I\u2019m sure everything will be fantastic! But I have some pretty serious doubts, obviously.\u201d\n\nOther conservatives are concerned it just won\u2019t work, arguing that North Korea has a long history of entering into negotiations that come \u201ctantalizingly close\u201d to an arms agreement before backing away. \n\nTom Nichols, a conservative writer and a professor at the US Naval College, told me that Trump\u2019s reality television \u201cdeal-making\u201d experience won\u2019t matter here. \u201cThe president\u2019s faith in his own deal-making is a quintessentially American view, but it presumes that the other guy is interested in a deal,\u201d Nichols told me. \u201cThe North Koreans are interested in North Korea, not in a showcasing a \u2018deal,\u2019 and if the president walks into this assuming that Kim Jong Un wants a deal, he\u2019s going to be unpleasantly surprised.\u201d\n\nIn an op-ed for USA Today, Nichols wrote that there\u2019s a far better chance of total \u201cdisaster\u201d than a Nobel Prize for Trump, given the North Korean diplomatic tradition of, in Nichols\u2019 terms, \u201cbait-and-switch.\u201d \u201cMost likely,\u201d rather than a stirring success for the Trump Administration, Nichols said, \u201cthe White House is about to walk right into a trap the North Koreans have been laying for American presidents since the 1990s.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s especially odd that some on the right are applauding Trump\u2019s willingness to meet with Kim, given their previous statements on Obama\u2019s efforts to meet with intransigent foreign powers was that it was \u201ctroubling.\u201d \n\nIn 2008, National Review\u2019s William J. Bennett wrote, \u201cBarack Obama\u2019s position on negotiating with U.S. enemies betrays a profound misreading of history,\u201d adding that if Obama were to meet with Iranian officials, \u201che will lower the prestige of the office of the president.\u201d \n\nObama\u2019s views on meeting with potentially dangerous governments were the subject of discussion during the second presidential debate between Obama and Sen. John McCain that same year. A conservative super PAC even made an ad targeting the \u201cwithout preconditions\u201d remark in 2008, featuring actors portraying Cuba\u2019s Fidel Castro and Kim Jong Il (Kim Jung Un\u2019s father) laughing about it, concluding with the words, \u201cBarack Obama: No Match for America\u2019s Enemies.\u201d\n\nBut in 2018, a number of Republicans are willing to give Trump\u2019s own meeting with a dictator a chance. \n\n\u201cIf North Korea disarms, President Trump\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize would be well deserved.\u201d\nSome conservatives are arguing that Trump\u2019s business acumen \u2014 and even his reality show past \u2014 could be helpful in pursuing negotiations with the North Korean government and ultimately achieving disarmament. \n\nAt the conservative website The Federalist, Ed Krayewski even said that \u201cit\u2019s possible\u201d for Trump\u2019s experience in running beauty pageants and professional wrestling to play a positive role in negotiations with Pyongyang.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so preposterous to think of diplomacy as a bit like reality television,\u201d he wrote on Friday. \u201cDifferent countries have different priorities and national security interests, but they\u2019re operating on an international stage with an international audience, and the pressure to \u201cget to yes\u201d that can come with that.\u201d\n\nOn the Hill, most Republican congressmen who have issued statements upon the news of Trump\u2019s planned meeting with North Korean officials have been pleased \u2014 Rep.

On Friday, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the meeting might not even take place: \u201cThe president will not have the meeting without seeing concrete steps and concrete actions take place by North Korea.\u201d\n\nAnd conservatives, divided now between viewing the meeting as a potential foreign policy coup or an incoming calamity, will likely remain just as in the dark as the rest of us.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Alex Ward", "body": "A bipartisan effort to end US involvement in a bloody, three-year war in Yemen failed in a close Senate vote on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe vote demonstrated growing pushback on President Donald Trump\u2019s coziness with Riyadh, which is leading the war effort in Yemen.

By a 55-44 margin, a majority of Republicans and some Democrats effectively said the US can still help Riyadh, by refueling its planes and providing intelligence in the Saudi\u2019s brutal air campaign. \n\nSupporters of the resolution claimed it would immediately end America\u2019s involvement in the war; critics said it wouldn\u2019t.\n\nSo far, the conflict has claimed more than 13,500 lives \u2014 many of them in airstrikes. Roughly 20 million Yemenis need humanitarian assistance to meet basic needs \u2014 including food and water \u2014 out of a prewar population of 28 million, and nearly 1 million people are suffering from cholera. However, conditions are so bad there that it is hard to have a reliable tally of any of these measures, which means the situation could be much, much worse.\n\nPart of the reason it\u2019s so hard to navigate Yemen is Riyadh\u2019s relentless bombing campaign. The Saudi military has conducted more than 145,000 missions in Yemen over the past three years. A Saudi general told the Wall Street Journal that about 100,000 of those were combat missions, conducting about 300 missions per day. One human rights group counted around 16,000 Saudi airstrikes in total, killing thousands of civilians in total. \n\nDuring a blockade last year, Saudi Arabia put various restrictions on Yemen\u2019s airspace and seaports, which led to the deaths of more than 5,000 civilians, more than 20 percent of whom were children.\n\nLee, one of the measure\u2019s co-sponsors, told me the push to pass the resolution was also to make a statement about how America goes to war. \u201cWe have a set of processes that have to be followed,\u201d he said, noting that Congress has the constitutional authority to declare war. \u201cIf advocates for this war within our government are confident that this is that important to America\u2019s national security interest, then they should bring forward those arguments and ask for an authorization,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut without that, we have no business getting involved in someone else\u2019s civil war.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration lobbied to defeat the measure. Last week, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis sent a letter to Congress requesting that lawmakers not restrict America\u2019s support for Riyadh\u2019s military. He claimed that stopping US assistance \u201ccould increase civilian casualties, jeopardize cooperation with our partners on counterterrorism, and reduce our influence with the Saudis \u2014 all of which would further exacerbate the situation and humanitarian crisis.\u201d Mattis traveled to the Hill on Tuesday to encourage members of both parties to block the resolution.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Congress has tried to stand up to the president on America\u2019s involvement in Yemen. Last November, the House of Representatives passed a similar resolution to the Senate version. That\u2019s because, by a wide 366-30 margin, the House believed the US is only authorized to fight terrorist groups like ISIS or al-Qaeda. Lawmakers said the US doesn\u2019t have authorization to fight the Houthis.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), who led the House effort, noted his displeasure with the vote in an interview with me but struck a note of optimism. \u201cEventually, we will prevail because our position is on the side of human decency and human rights, consistent with basic American values,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe just need to keeping speaking up for peace and for the children in Yemen.\u201d\n\nScott Paul, a Yemen expert at the humanitarian group Oxfam America, was unhappy with the news, telling me that \u201ctoday should have been the day that the Senate moved to end US involvement in this catastrophe.\u201d But Paul noted that some senators may have voted against the measure because the Senate Foreign Relations Committee may soon take up the issue. \u201cWe expect Congress to take decisive action soon,\u201d he said. \n\nBut Tuesday\u2019s vote was relatively close, and that is important on its own. It\u2019s even more noteworthy because on Tuesday, Trump welcomed Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince and the driving force behind the Yemen war to the White House to discuss their burgeoning relationship and arms sales.\n\nTrump had previously issued statements asking Saudi Arabia to cease violating human rights in Yemen. But in his two public statements alongside MBS, as the crown prince is widely known, at the White House, Trump didn\u2019t mention the word \u201cYemen\u201d once.\n\nOne man drives the Saudi-led war on Yemen\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is seen during a meeting with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office at the White House on March 20, 2018.\n      \n      \n        Kevin Dietsch-Pool/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nMohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto leader, champions the fighting in Yemen. It\u2019s part of his aggressive anti-Iran policy in the Middle East, which led him to intervene in Yemen in support of the internationally recognized government against the Houthis.\n\nIran\u2019s government is a Shia Muslim theocracy; Saudi Arabia\u2019s government is a monarchy closely aligned with the country\u2019s Sunni Muslim religious establishment. The two countries represent two ideological and political poles and have spent decades fighting each other for dominance in the Middle East and for the right to represent the Muslim world.\n\nMBS, along with his father, King Salman, completed a purge of an astonishing 11 princes and dozens of other officials and businessmen last November. That allowed MBS to consolidate even more power in Saudi Arabia, which gives him even more authority to direct Riyadh\u2019s war in Yemen.\n\nTrump continues to support MBS, going so far as to approve his purge in a tweet on November 6. At a joint appearance at the White House on Tuesday, Trump continued to show his backing for MBS and Saudi Arabia writ large.\n\n\u201cThe relationship is probably the strongest it\u2019s ever been,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe understand each other.\u201d\n\nZack Beauchamp contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Andrew Prokop", "body": "Last October, special counsel Robert Mueller indicted Paul Manafort on nine counts, all related to his past work for Ukrainian politicians and the millions of dollars he got from that work.

His investigators have also been scrutinizing some $16 million in loans Manafort got after the 2016 election \u2014 and are looking into whether Manafort promised his lender a Trump administration job in return, according to a report Wednesday by NBC News\u2019s Tom Winter and Hallie Jackson.\n\nMueller alluded to the loans in a court filing Friday, during deliberations over Manafort\u2019s bail package. He wrote that he\u2019d learned of \u201cadditional criminal conduct\u201d from Manafort, including \u201ca series of bank frauds and bank fraud conspiracies.\u201d And he wrote that Manafort had gotten those particular loans \u201cthrough a series of false and fraudulent  Politico\u2019s Josh Gerstein reported Wednesday that Mueller has filed new, sealed charges in the case against Manafort and Rick Gates. This new charging document isn\u2019t yet public, and it\u2019s not clear whom or what it\u2019s about. But these loans seem one obvious possibility.\n\nManafort got $16 million in loans from a bank headed by a Trump adviser after the election\nManafort\u2019s post-election loans have long seemed curious. An excellent report by the New York Times\u2019s Mike McIntire from nearly a year ago laid out the timeline:\n\n\nOn August 19, 2016, Manafort left the Trump campaign, after being pushed out.\nThat same day, Manafort filed papers to create a new shell company: Summerbreeze LLC.\nIn September 2016, Summerbreeze got a $3.5 million loan from Spruce Capital, a New York investment firm whose co-founder has developed Trump hotel projects and that is financially backed by a Ukrainian billionaire. (Manafort\u2019s home in the Hamptons was the collateral.)\nAfter Trump won the election, in late 2016, Summerbeeze got another $9.5 million loan from the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago. And in January 2017, that same bank loaned Manafort $6.5 million more. (All these were, again, collateralized by Manafort\u2019s properties.)\n\nThose last loans seemed particularly odd because, per the Times, the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago \u201cfocuses on affordable mortgages for military veterans,\u201d and the loan to Manafort amounted to more than 5 percent of its total assets. Furthermore, the bank\u2019s head, Stephen Calk, was part of Trump\u2019s economic advisory council during the campaign \u2014 raising questions of impropriety.\n\nNow, NBC\u2019s Winter and Jackson add the news that Mueller\u2019s team is examining whether Manafort had promised Calk a Trump White House job in return for those loans. (He didn\u2019t end up getting any job.) \n\nThe NBC reporters also write that \u201cthe three loans were questioned by other officials at the bank, and one source said that at least one of the bank employees who felt pressured into approving the deals is cooperating with investigators.\u201d (A spokesperson for Manafort has said that the loans had above-market-rate interest and were overcollateralized.)\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of news in the Manafort/Gates case lately\nIf there is a new bank fraud charge against Manafort, it would turn up the heat on him even further. \n\nThere have been several recent reports suggesting that Manafort\u2019s longtime business partner Rick Gates, who was indicted alongside him last October, is on the verge of \u201cflipping\u201d and making a plea deal with Mueller\u2019s team. That, however, hasn\u2019t been publicly confirmed yet.\n\nMeanwhile, on Tuesday, a lawyer who had worked with Manafort and Gates on their Ukraine work \u2014 Alex van der Zwaan \u2014 pleaded guilty to making false statements. He admitted to lying to Mueller\u2019s team about when his last communications with Gates and another unnamed person took place, and lying about deleting and not providing relevant emails to investigators.\n\nNow there is the new report that new charges have already been filed in the Manafort case. Those could involve Gates flipping, or a new bank fraud charge against Manafort, or something else entirely \u2014 we won\u2019t know until the new charging document is unsealed.\n\nAll this could be aimed mainly at bolstering Mueller\u2019s case against Manafort. Or it could have the primary goal of pressuring Manafort himself to flip, if he were to have information incriminating President Trump.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Ella Nilsen", "body": "For the first time in nearly 15 years, Republicans in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District are starting to get nervous. \n\nOn its face, the March 13 special congressional election in the southwest corner of Pennsylvania should be a breeze for the GOP. The Cook Political Report rates the district R+11 (due in part to partisan gerrymandering that the state Supreme Court recently ruled unconstitutional). \n\nThe newly open seat was held by former Rep. Tim Murphy (R-PA) since 2003, who was so secure in his seat that he often failed to attract a Democratic challenger. Murphy suddenly resigned in October amid revelations that he had pressured a woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair to have an abortion. But even after he stepped down, national Democrats didn\u2019t think they could compete in the special election, a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee operative told Vox. \n\nThat was, until Democrat Conor Lamb came along. \n\nLamb is a 33-year-old Marine and former assistant US attorney who prosecuted drug dealers in the midst of Pennsylvania\u2019s deadly opioid crisis. New to politics, he has struck a decidedly independent tone, making headlines when he said he would not support House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi as the Democratic leader if a blue wave sweeps the House in 2018.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got local ties; he\u2019s a local guy,\u201d said Tim Waters, political director for the United Steelworkers Political Action Committee. \u201cHe\u2019s a young guy with a lot of energy ... right down the line on issues that affect workers in this district.\u201d\n\nFocused almost exclusively on local issues, Lamb has nevertheless stumbled into a long-running debate about how the Democratic Party can claw its way back to the majority after 2016. \n\nFocused on recapturing blue-collar workers, Lamb\u2019s campaign represents one school of thought \u2014 going back to labor-liberal economic values and working with unions to retake territory in Midwest and Rust Belt states that voted for Donald Trump in 2016. Others say the party must look to its future: voters of color and young people who represent its energized base, like it did to pull out a win for Doug Jones in Alabama\u2019s December special election for US Senate. \n\nStill others, including former Vice President Joe Biden, say Democrats can do both. At a recent speech in front of House Democrats, Biden said the notion that Democrats have to choose between blue-collar workers and their progressive base was a \u201cfalse debate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a false debate we\u2019re having among ourselves, in my opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s not rip ourselves apart in a debate that is irrelevant.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are in a good position going into the 2018 midterms, especially given the current backlash against Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress. This is in part due to fundamentals that favor the party out of power in midterm elections, but President Trump\u2019s unpopularity has also given Democrats across the country something to rally around. And special elections have been very good for Democrats so far; they have swept a number of state races in red districts in Virginia, Wisconsin, and Kentucky, plus the Senate race in Alabama. \n\nLamb rarely mentions Trump in his campaign speeches. But his candidacy is an important post-2016 test of whether the party can successfully run moderate candidates in deeply red Rust Belt districts that swung for the president two years ago.\n\nEven if Lamb loses in March, he\u2019ll have another opportunity to compete again in the fall in an 18th District that looks different (and more favorable to Democrats), given the new congressional map drawn up by Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court. But if he wins, it will be another sign that Democratic momentum is strong and barreling toward November.\n\nWho\u2019s on the ballot on March 13\nLamb\u2019s opponent is Pennsylvania state Rep. Rick Saccone, a Republican who has described himself as \u201cTrump before Trump was Trump.\u201d Trump is certainly popular in the district, which he won by 20 points in 2016 (Mitt Romney won it by 16 points in 2012). Saccone is a decidedly conservative Republican who is pro-life, pro-gun, anti-government spending, and \u2014 perhaps most importantly in this heavily unionized district \u2014 vehemently anti-union. \n\n\u201cSaccone is a movement conservative,\u201d said Mike DeVanney, a longtime Republican political operative in Pennsylvania who worked on past Murphy campaigns. \u201cHis base is much more to the right than Murphy\u2019s was.\u201d\n\nDeVanney described the likelihood of a Democrat winning the 18th as a \u201cherculean task,\u201d especially considering Republican-allied groups are outspending Democrats 17 to 1. Republican and Democratic operatives in Pennsylvania agree on two things: Lamb is still very much the underdog in this race, but by getting support from unions that used to back Murphy and capitalizing on national Democratic enthusiasm, he has a fighting chance. (Lamb\u2019s campaign did not make him available for an interview despite repeated requests from Vox. Saccone\u2019s campaign also did not return an interview request.) \n\nThis is reflected in recent poll numbers showing Saccone\u2019s former double-digit lead has diminished significantly. A recent Monmouth poll shows the Republican with a slight lead, hovering around 49 percent to 46 percent (models with lower turnout give Saccone a slightly larger lead). Given the steep odds, these numbers are extremely good for Lamb. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s enthusiasm I haven\u2019t seen for a Democratic candidate for a long time,\u201d said veteran Pennsylvania Democratic political consultant Mike Mikus, who lives in the 18th Congressional District. \u201cI don\u2019t think the national Republicans would be spending all this money if they thought it was a slam-dunk.\u201d\n\nWhat kind of Democrat can win PA-18?\nIf Lamb is going to win on March 13, political experts say he needs to straddle a moderate political line, which he\u2019s so far been able to do. \n\nThere are technically 70,000 more registered Democrats in the 18th Congressional District than Republicans, but many of those voters have been casting ballots for GOP candidates for years. Mikus, who has worked on Democratic campaigns in the state for years, says Lamb needs to prove himself as an independent if he\u2019s going to win over these voters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much a conservative district as it is an economic populist district,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to support the NRA down the line, but respect the right of people to own firearms ... and [be] someone that\u2019s willing to stand up to the national party when they feel it\u2019s in the interest of the district or the region.\u201d\n\nThough Lamb is from a well-known Pittsburgh Democratic family (his grandfather served as the Pennsylvania state Senate Democratic majority leader), it\u2019s his first time running for office. He is keeping a careful distance from the national political party, drawing notice for his comments on Pelosi and not accepting Super PAC money. \n\nHis platform hits a lot of Pennsylvania\u2019s biggest issues: jobs, protecting entitlements like Social Security and Medicare, organized labor, and helping end the heroin crisis currently ravaging the state. And he\u2019s not trying to model himself as a progressive darling; a practicing Catholic, he says that while he personally opposes abortion, he supports Roe v. Wade as the law of the land. As a veteran, he is also pro-Second Amendment. \n\n\u201cConor, I think so far, has done a fairly good job as portraying himself as someone that\u2019s going to fight for the region,\u201d Mikus said. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously getting outspent, but I think he\u2019s saying the right things on TV and on the stump.\u201d\n\nSaccone and the Republicans have an obvious advantage when it comes to money; the national Republican Party and conservative groups are dumping cash into the race and bringing out the big players to stump for Saccone: President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and Ivanka Trump have made all made public appearances with the candidate. \n\nSaccone is also benefiting from a deluge of outside spending. The Washington Post\u2019s Dave Weigel and Michael Scherer estimated Republican-allied groups have so far spent about $4.7 million in television and radio ads compared to the approximately $300,000 Democratic groups have raised for Lamb.\n\nBut when it comes to the campaigns themselves, Lamb is outraising Saccone 2 to 1.  Federal Election Commission records show that Lamb finished 2017 having raised about $557,551. Meanwhile, Saccone raised a total of $214,675. A chunk of that was not fundraised \u2014 Saccone loaned himself $11,000, and his campaign transferred another $41,899 over from a previous committee financing a Senate bid of Saccone\u2019s that never got off the ground.\n\nPolitical operatives say it\u2019s another indication of the enthusiasm behind the Democrat. And in a race that\u2019s sure to be spun as a referendum on Trump\u2019s presidency no matter who wins, many say it\u2019s much more about the two candidates and the local issues in the 18th.\n\n\u201cThis is hopefully going to be about these two candidates,\u201d Waters said. \u201cIf it is, Conor Lamb is a rising star.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 best hope might be aligning with unions\nEven though PA-18 is a deeply red district, it\u2019s also strong union territory. It contains more than 87,000 union members and their family members, everyone from building trades to energy workers to teachers. \n\nSteelworkers are active, and although the district\u2019s last coal mine recently closed down, tens of thousands of retired union coal workers and their spouses remain in the area. Mikus estimated they could make up 20 to 25 percent of the electorate, while a DCCC operative estimates it\u2019s closer to 30 percent.\n\nLabor union members were also a huge demographic for Trump in 2016; after the presidential race, national exit polls showed Democrat Hillary Clinton had captured 51 percent of union households, 7 points less than President Obama in 2012. Meanwhile, Trump captured 42 percent of union households, a slight bump from Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nFormer Rep. Tim Murphy, the onetime chair of the Congressional Steel Caucus, courted building trades unions for years and won the support of many. Saccone is doing the exact opposite, currying favor from right-to-work groups via his reputation for authoring state bills trying to end paid union leave for teachers who were working for their unions outside of the classroom, and voting for other bills targeting unionized workers.\n\n\u201cUnlike Tim Murphy, who really made his career as a Republican reaching out to labor ... Rick Saccone is the exact opposite,\u201d Mikus said.\n\nWaters, the political director for the United Steelworkers PAC, put it another way.\n\n\u201cTim Murphy was more of candidate that would say what he thought people wanted to hear,\u201d Waters said. \u201cRick Saccone is a zealot. Murphy was more like, \u2018Test the water.\u2019 This guy just jumps in with a belly flop.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s having an impact among union leaders, even ones who spent years supporting Murphy. Nearly all the major unions have thrown their support behind Lamb and are helping him mount an organized door-knocking campaign throughout the district.\n\n\u201cI think most of the building trades who had supported Murphy and helped give him large margins are going to the Democrat,\u201d said DeVanney, the Republican strategist.\n\nWhat\u2019s yet to be seen is whether union leaders can successfully convince their rank and file to go to the ballot box and cast their votes for Lamb in March. But they are certainly trying; Waters said political and union organizers have already knocked on tens of thousands of doors and will hit more in the coming weeks. He compares the enthusiasm to Alabama\u2019s special election that helped propel the state\u2019s first Democratic candidate in 25 years to the US Senate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the biggest union in this congressional district,\u201d Waters said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work until the last minute on Election Day. We\u2019re going to make sure we talk to every single union voter,\u201d as well as retirees and their families.\n\nLamb\u2019s performance in the special election is a test case for what could happen in November\nEven if Lamb loses, he\u2019ll have a completely different district to compete in during future races (should he decide to do so). \n\nIn 2010, Pennsylvania\u2019s Republican-controlled state legislature drafted congressional maps that made it near impossible for a Democrat like Lamb to win in the 18th District.\n\nAs Vox\u2019s Andrew Prokop wrote: \n\n\nUgly-looking districts don\u2019t always point to gerrymandering, but in this case, they do \u2014 Republicans tried to pack Democratic-leaning areas together into very few districts while surrounding the state\u2019s big cities with districts Republicans would win comfortably.\n\nTo get a sense of how powerful Pennsylvania\u2019s gerrymander was, consider that in 2012, Democratic candidates won slightly more votes in US House elections and Barack Obama won the state. But the state\u2019s 18 House seats didn\u2019t split 9-9 between the parties \u2014 instead, Republicans won 13 seats there, and Democrats just won five. No seats changed partisan hands in the 2014 or 2016 elections, either.\n\n\nBut given a recent Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling that resulted in the state redrawing its congressional districts, the updated 18th District will include parts of liberal Pittsburgh, which should make it much friendlier to Democrats. It\u2019s far from the only district that\u2019s changing; the new map reflects population changes more accurately, splits fewer counties, and will likely lead to many more competitive elections between Democrats and Republicans. \n\nThese changes won\u2019t kick in by March 13, so Lamb and Pennsylvania Democrats have extra incentive to see if they can pull off a long-shot campaign in a district where the odds are still stacked against him. They feel confident, and cautiously optimistic.\n\n\u201cI like the choice in this thing,\u201d Waters said. \u201cI like our chances.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Zack Beauchamp", "body": "Shortly after President Trump ousted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and tapped CIA Director Mike Pompeo to take his place, State Department spokesman Steve Goldstein issued a statement on the firing that\u2019s frankly astonishing. \n\nGoldstein confirmed that Tillerson was fired, a rarity in a Washington where \u201cresigns to spend more time with his family\u201d is the norm. But it goes further than that, revealing that Trump did not inform Tillerson of the reason for his firing or even speak to his secretary personally before dismissing him. \n\nI\u2019ve been in Washington covering foreign policy and politics for nearly a decade now.

You have to believe that after a decade of paying Manafort millions for his expertise to help pro-Russian candidates win elections in Ukraine, no one from Moscow thought to consult with him about how to help a pro-Russia candidate win an election in the United States. \n\nAnd we have to believe that even though we know Trump\u2019s son was both in touch with WikiLeaks and openly enthusiastic about the idea of collaborating with Russia on obtaining and disseminating anti-Hillary Clinton dirt, when he met with Russians on this very topic, they didn\u2019t talk about it. And, of course, we have to believe that Trump\u2019s specific \u2014 and quite public \u2014 call for Putin to hack more Clinton emails was completely random.\n\nTrump\u2013Russia skeptics, legion in the political press, brush all this aside in a gesture of faux-sophistication, positing a bizarre series of coincidences complete with a massive cover-up all \u2014 for no particular reason. \n\n\nTo speak the obvious has become nearly forbidden. But here goes: Donald Trump has gone to extraordinary lengths over the course of his time in office to try to stymie or discredit rigorous investigation of the Russia matter. The most likely explanation for why he has done it is that he is guilty of serious Russia-related wrongdoing. \n\nThere are viable alternative hypotheses, like he's a huge moron or he\u2019s guilty of some other serious wrongdoing that he fears an investigation will uncover. But the best bet is that things are exactly as they seem and he\u2019s acting guilty because he\u2019s guilty. \n\nDonald Trump is not stupid\nOne thing Trump\u2019s supporters tend to get right is that the political media in the United States is generally far too willing to paint a portrait of Trump as some kind of dolt. But everything in Trump\u2019s record suggests a cunning, ruthless, and, in many ways, insightful man \u2014 not some kind of Forrest Gump-like figure ambling through history.\n\nA few examples: \n\n\nThe means he used to get himself out of bankruptcy and make his big Atlantic City comeback were incredibly shady and dishonest, but also genuinely clever. \nHis reinvention of himself as an asset-light brand licensor was incredibly successful, as was his career as a television show host.\n He has, for years, used lawyer Michael Cohen and a relationship with a major tabloid conglomerate to keep affairs hushed up and manipulate the public\u2019s image of him. \nLast but by no means least, he ambled into the 2016 GOP primary field with little fundraising, no political experience, and minimal organization and wiped the floor with everyone. \n\nPeople who cover American politics for a living are accustomed to covering politicians who have at least a passing familiarity with the main issues in public policy, and Trump does not. He answers questions about national politics like he\u2019s a real estate developer turned brand licensing magnate and reality television star, which he is. \n\nI\u2019m not here to tell you that Trump is an evil genius or a criminal mastermind. And he\u2019s certainly more impulsive than your average politician or business leader. But he\u2019s not an idiot. When he keeps on doing something, it\u2019s probably for a reason. \n\nThe choking clouds of smoke\nI hate the word \u201ccollusion.\u201d It\u2019s a technical, legal term derived from the unrelated world of antitrust law that\u2019s masked the simplicity of what we\u2019re talking about. It seems more likely than not that some Trumpworld personnel coordinated some elements of political strategy with the Russian pro-Trump information operation with the tacit or explicit approval of Trump himself, and that they signaled openness to Russia-friendly policy changes Russia in exchange. \n\nHere\u2019s are the main elements of the case: \n\n\nMany of the Russian government\u2019s political interventions abroad are clumsy and inept (see the anti-Macron stuff from the 2017 French presidential election and the bulk of the \u201ctroll farm\u201d stuff). But the WikiLeaks email drops of 2016 were very well-executed and well-timed to step on two major stories, first the Democratic National Convention and later the Access Hollywood tape. Perhaps the Russians got lucky (twice) or they executed well because they were helped by an expert American political operative.\nAs it happens, the expertise of Trump\u2019s campaign chair, Paul Manafort, is in American and foreign electioneering. Manafort helped Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush win presidential elections before he moved into lobbying and took his political skills abroad. He spent a decade dispensing expert political advice (for a steep price) to a Russian proxy party in Ukraine. So it\u2019s not like the Russians would have no idea who to ask, or that nobody on the Trump team was comfortable, broadly speaking, with the idea of working with Moscow. \nWe also know specifically, thanks to Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s infamous \u201cif it\u2019s what you say, I love it\u201d email, that not only Manafort but also Trump\u2019s son and his son-in-law were eager to collaborate with the Russian government on the 2016 election.\nTrump spent more than a year on the campaign trail consistently praising Vladimir Putin and defending him from critics, incurring political risks with no obvious upside for himself. \nDuring the transition, Trump\u2019s top national security adviser Michael Flynn was very eager to conduct talks with Moscow about a warming of relations. Kushner was trying to create some kind of secure back-channel line of communication to Moscow that would be impenetrable by American intelligence. \nTrump took the exceptionally risky move of firing FBI Director James Comey. After that backfired, he took repeated stabs at trying to lean on Attorney General Jeff Sessions and/or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to resign, which would give him more direct control over Mueller. \nTrump\u2019s allies on the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee have been trying to help him with various attacks on the FBI, the Justice Department, and the whole idea of an inquiry rather than by constructing some plausible alternative narrative that would explain all the weird shit referenced above. \n\nThat\u2019s not an argument you\u2019d present to secure a jury conviction, but it\u2019s probable cause for a rigorous investigation. It all explains Mueller\u2019s apparent strategy of bringing legal pressure to bear on as many Trumpworld figures as possible. It\u2019s a sound strategy for generating the revelation of some dark secrets.\n\nTrump is good at keeping secrets\nThe Trump era has led to a lot of amazing, compulsively readable journalism that undersells Trump\u2019s ability to keep secrets. \n\nHounshell writes that \u201cso much damaging information poured out of Trump Tower that it\u2019s hard to believe a conspiracy to collude with Moscow to win the election never went public\u201d and that \u201cif there was such a conspiracy, it must have been a very closely guarded secret.\u201d\n\nBut consider that despite Trumpworld\u2019s reputation for leaking like a sieve, we\u2019ve never found out what\u2019s on Trump\u2019s income tax returns or how the decision was made that whatever is on them is more damning than Trump\u2019s shady behavior. We don\u2019t know why Trump decided to fire Flynn (the stated reason that he \u201clied to Mike Pence\u201d doesn\u2019t pass the laugh test), whether he was told of the domestic abuse allegations against former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter, what\u2019s on the Apprentice outtakes footage that producer Mark Burnett is keeping locked up, why exactly Trump handed some choice Israeli intelligence to the Russian foreign minister, who financed the hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, or any of a dozen other major questions about Trump.\n\nThe reality is that Trump was the least-transparent candidate of all time and is running one of the least-transparent administrations on record. It\u2019s a White House where even whether or not the president is golfing on any given weekend is the subject of dissembling and fabrication. \n\nOne result of unprecedented secrecy is an unprecedented volume of disclosures. But that doesn\u2019t mean we actually have an unprecedented level of insight into what\u2019s going on with Trump or his operation. Quite the opposite. \n\nEspecially given congressional Republicans\u2019 total abdication of Congress\u2019s normal oversight functions, Mueller\u2019s inquiry is essentially our only lens into some very murky terrain. And the investigators themselves are keeping their cards close to their chests. \n\nMueller\u2019s investigation is already bearing fruit\nPerhaps this will prove wrong and ultimately the Mueller investigation will uncover nothing of note except crimes committed by Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, his former campaign manager and deputy campaign manager, and a handful of lesser players while having also exposed both the president himself and essentially his entire senior staff as habitual liars on a manner of criminal and national security import.\n\nIf true, that would qualify as probably the biggest presidential scandal since Iran-Contra a generation ago. It\u2019s also already had the ancillary benefit of inspiring lots of DC shops to start actually complying with Foreign Agent Registration Act rules.\n\n\n\nThe new filing this morning from Bob Mueller is a reminder to anyone trying to draw final conclusions: He is far from done with this investigation.\n\u2014 Matt Viser (@mviser) February 20, 2018\n\n\n\n\nLast but by no means least, it seems clear that whether or not there was an explicit or tacit agreement on this point, Trump entered office intending to pivot American foreign policy in a more pro-Russian direction and installed Flynn as national security adviser and Rex Tillerson as secretary of state with a view to implementing that agenda. \n\nThe investigation \u2014 dating back to before James Comey\u2019s firing and Mueller\u2019s appointment \u2014 seems to have played a big role in scuttling this and pushing Trump to maintain broad continuity with prior American foreign policy. \n\nThe one place I do agree with Mueller skeptics is that liberals shouldn\u2019t get their hopes up that the special counsel will \u201csave\u201d them or the country from Trump. Trump appeared on national television and explained to an NBC News audience that he improperly used his powers of office to remove the FBI director in an effort to shield his friends and associates from criminal scrutiny. The institutional Republican Party shrugged that off and, eventually, the public moved on. \n\nMy guess is that whatever revelations are forthcoming from Mueller will fit a similar pattern \u2014 most people already have a negative view of Trump so it\u2019s hard to move the needle too much more on public opinion, and the whole GOP has already wagered so heavily on the Trump experiment that they\u2019re not going to pull the plug regardless of what happened. \n\nBut politics aside, the suspicion of illicit collaboration between the highest-ranking members of the Trump campaign and the Russian pro-Trump information operation is well-founded, and the ongoing criminal investigation into that possibility is steadily bearing fruit. There\u2019s no earthly reason for journalists to adopt a stance of preemptively exonerating Trump when, so far, suspicion has been validated at nearly every turn.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "German Lopez", "body": "Three months after Vox broke the story about how Wyoming law enforcement wrongly took $91,800 from an out-of-state traveler during a traffic stop, state legislators have changed the law to try to prevent something like this from happening again.\n\nDemocratic state Rep. Charles Pelkey told me that he \u201cwould never have introduced this bill had I not read your story.\u201d The measure passed with bipartisan support in both chambers of the legislature, and it was signed by Republican Gov. Matt Mead last week.\n\nVox was tipped off about the story by the Institute for Justice, an advocacy group that works against wrongful police seizures of cash and property, particularly civil forfeiture. The group represented Phil Parhamovich of Wisconsin, helping him get his money back from Wyoming law enforcement at a court hearing just hours after Vox\u2019s story was published.\n\nParhamovich was stopped in March 2017 while traveling on I-80 in Wyoming during a concert tour with his band, the Dirt Brothers. Parhamovich, who has no criminal record, was not accused of or charged with a serious crime; he only got a $25 ticket for improperly wearing his seat belt and a warning for \u201clane use.\u201d\n\nBut Wyoming law enforcement officers found and eventually seized the $91,800 in cash, as it was hidden in a speaker cabinet \u2014 by getting Parhamovich, under what he says was duress, to sign away his interest in the money through a waiver. According to Parhamovich, police pushed him to sign the waiver after he said the money was not his, following aggressive questioning that he said made him fear that carrying that much cash is illegal. (It is not.)\n\nThe new law, which takes effect on July 1, bans officers from getting people to sign waivers that give up their rights to property, including cash, without a hearing and without establishing probable cause. Any waivers in violation of the law are declared \u201cnull and void.\u201d\n\nThe waivers provided a loophole around previous reforms\nParhamovich got his money back following a court hearing in December, where he and his attorney, the Institute for Justice\u2019s Anya Bidwell, were met by legislators from Wyoming, who had read Vox\u2019s story and reached out to the Institute for Justice to see what they could do to help. According to Bidwell and one of the state legislators who was present, the judge agreed that if Parhamovich was willing to testify that the money was his, he would order the state to give the money back. When Parhamovich agreed, the judge ruled in his favor. \n\nParhamovich said in a statement that it\u2019s \u201ca great relief to know that no one will have to go through what I went through. Obviously our police system is in need of many reforms but this is a step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nParhamovich intends to use the money as a down payment to buy a music studio in Madison, Wisconsin, called Smart Studios, where Nirvana and the Smashing Pumpkins recorded songs. Without the cash, Parhamovich was worried that the deal for the studio could fall through after a nine-month lease expired. But now he\u2019s able to move forward to close the deal.\n\nThe case was similar to other stories that have come out over the past few years about police abusing what\u2019s called civil forfeiture, which allows law enforcement to seize and absorb private property, from cash to cars to boats, without ever charging the owner with a crime. To do this under civil forfeiture, police only need probable cause to believe the property is linked to criminal activity, typically drug trafficking. Police can then absorb the value of this property as profit, either through state programs or under a federal program known as \u201cequitable sharing\u201d that lets local and state police get up to 80 percent of the value of what they seize as money for their departments.\n\nCritics have long decried civil forfeiture for creating a perverse incentive for law enforcement to essentially police for profit.\n\nParhamovich\u2019s case was unique in that police seemed to bypass civil forfeiture law \u2014 including reforms enacted by Wyoming in 2016 \u2014 by getting him to sign a waiver that supposedly gave up his interest in the cash. The new law effectively closes the loophole.\n\nThe Institute for Justice cheered the move in a statement but argued that Wyoming still needs further reforms to prevent more abuses of forfeiture in the future.\n\n\u201cDue process doesn\u2019t happen on the side of a road and we\u2019re pleased to see Wyoming ban this abusive tactic,\u201d Institute for Justice attorney Dan Alban said. \u201cBut the state\u2019s civil forfeiture laws remained unchanged, and still need major reform. No one should lose their property without being convicted of a crime.\u201d\n\nFor more on Parhamovich\u2019s case, read Vox\u2019s full story.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matthew Yglesias", "body": "Conor Lamb unquestionably struck some culturally conservative notes \u2014 touting his military experience and his support for gun rights while downplaying immigration and racial justice topics \u2014 on the way to his victory.

A Roman Catholic, he says he personally opposes abortion.\n\nBut he opposes the GOP-proposed 20-week ban on abortions and has seen his views come under attack during the special election. And in an interview, he emphasized that the country was founded on the principle of separating church and state.\n\n\u201cTo me, that means we defend the law as it is,\u201d he said.\n\n\nAnd, naturally, before Election Day, conservatives were very clear about this. National Review ran an article, as they tend to once every few years, explaining that Lamb\u2019s position on this is at odds with Catholic doctrine, which holds that a religious obligation exists to try to affirmatively prevent abortions from happening.\n\nObviously, words are just words. We could describe politicians with Lamb\u2019s view as \u201cpro-life\u201d if we wanted to. But no anti-abortion groups consider his position to be acceptable, and no pro-choice groups consider it especially problematic. By all the normal rules of American politics, he is pro-choice and not pro-life. \n\nInterestingly, as Roarty notes, Lamb is not alone in this regard. In the recent past, abortion was an issue on which it was common to see Democrats running in tough districts take heterodox positions. These days you still see that frequently on guns, topics related to fossil fuel extraction, and possibly immigration. \n\nBut on abortion, essentially every prominent Democratic challenger \u2014 including Sen.

Democrats are promoting increases to education spending, medical research, and how they fended off major conservative poison pills, like efforts to defund Planned Parenthood or expand immigrant detention centers. Republicans are celebrating the huge increases to military spending and a small bundle of border wall funding.\n\nBut this time leaders have also couched their celebratory speeches with a dose of reality: No one is the absolute winner.\n\n\u201cThe result is legislation that neither sides sees as perfect but which contains a host of significant victories and important achievements on behalf of the American people,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said on the Senate floor Thursday.\n\nEven so, here are some of the clear winners and losers. \n\nLoser: Trump\u2019s immigration agenda\nPut simply, this spending bill does not reflect the hardline immigration agenda Trump and his White House have long espoused.\n\nOn enforcement, Republicans went into this week wanting more funding for the Department of Homeland Security to both increase the number of beds for immigrant detainees and to expand the enforcement force, with a call to fund 1,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and 500 more Customs and Border Protection officers. \n\nThe final compromise: funding for only an additional 328 additional Customs and Border Protection officers and ICE will actually have to reduce the number detention beds. Needless to say, this isn\u2019t the kind of deportation force Trump\u2019s administration was envisioning. The bill also does not defund so-called \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d something the White House specifically called on Congress to do.\n\nIt does include some border wall funding \u2014 $1.6 billion worth \u2014 which is much less than the $25 billion the White House asked for. And it comes with a lot of strings attached; most of the funding will have to go toward repairing existing fencing or toward double fencing where barriers already exist. In other words, this isn\u2019t money for Trump\u2019s big, beautiful wall. \n\nAs I reported last week, Trump\u2019s White House has been frustrated with the spending bill \u2014 especially on immigration. Trump officials even tried to back-channel conservative ideas with allies in Congress to defund \u201csanctuary cities\u201d or push for more border wall spending, but to no avail. Trump reportedly threatened to veto the bill yesterday but was walked off the ledge.\n\nAs Vox\u2019s Dara Lind writes, not only did Trump get very little of what he asked for, \u201cCongress is actually making an effort to rein in the Trump administration\u2019s overspending on immigration detention instead of expanding it.\u201d\n\nWinner: the Republican tax bill\nWhen Republicans rushed their tax bill through Congress at the end of last year, they made mistakes.\n\nThe biggest: Republicans accidentally created a massive disparity in the agricultural industry.\n\nThe technical error \u2014 dubbed the \u201cgrain glitch\u201d \u2014 essentially gave more lucrative tax deductions to farmers who sold agricultural products, like grains, to farm cooperatives instead of privately owned farms. The benefits of selling to cooperatives under the GOP tax law are so large that the Wall Street Journal reported it could let some farmers reduce their taxable income to zero. \n\nThe error gave cooperatives \u2014 including farming giants like Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. \u2014 the major advantage and put smaller privately owned agricultural businesses at risk of closing shop. Needless, to say the \u201cgrain glitch\u201d was a major priority for lawmakers representing America\u2019s agricultural regions. \n\nIn some last-minute negotiations, Democrats, who have been reluctant to help Republicans fix their tax bill, struck a deal to amend the tax law\u2019s language to fix the \u201cgrain glitch\u201d in exchange for expanding the low-income housing tax credit that goes toward building more affordable housing. The Internal Revenue Service also got a $196 budget boost to help implement the new tax law.\n\nLoser: Betsy DeVos\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Congress rejected DeVos\u2019s agenda.\n      \n      \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos had some grand plans for the Department of Education, including budget cuts for public schools and after-school programs in exchange for $1 billion in spending to promote school choice programs, vouchers, and magnets. She wanted to eliminate a grant program for low-income students to go to college and slash $1.7 million from the Office of Civil Rights, a bureau within the Education Department that ensures equal access to education and enforces civil rights in school, which she said had grown inefficient.\n\nShe got none of those things.\n\nInstead, Congress\u2019s spending bill was a clear rejection of DeVos\u2019s education agenda. The spending bill included a $3.9 billion increase to the department\u2019s funding. \n\nGoing down the list, DeVos\u2019s requests were ignored on almost every front.\n\nThere was no funding for private school vouchers or her \u201cpublic school choice\u201d initiative, and the bill increased funding for the Office of Civil Rights by $8.5 million.\n\nDeVos called to freeze the Pell Grant award for low-income students at $5,920. Lawmakers increased the ceiling to $6,095. The federal work-study program, which Trump\u2019s administration proposed to cut in half, also got a funding boost.\n\nThe omnibus also included more funding for school-based mental health programs, which DeVos\u2019s budget cut, and increased funding for the Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant, which goes toward financing low-income students\u2019 college expenses, by $107 million. The DC Tuition Assistance Grant, which aids Washington DC, students who don\u2019t have access to an affordable in-state university system, got a $40 million boost. DeVos had proposed cutting the program this year and eliminating altogether by 2019.\n\nWinner: government data\nWith a 2020 Census on the horizon, the Census Bureau will get another $1.34 billion in funding, double what the Trump administration\u2019s budget called for \u2014 and a Democratic priority.\n\nThe Census Bureau has been at the center of a funding battle with Congress for some time, and, as Vox\u2019s Dylan Matthews\u2019 explained, has had to find some creative ways to cut costs ahead of its 2020 nationwide survey. The information gathered by the census questionnaire and interviews \u2014 which by law is mandated every 10 years \u2014 is used for everything from drawing congressional districts distributing hundreds of millions of federal dollars for infrastructure, schools, and public services. This will be a welcomed boost.\n\nFor the first time ever, the spending bill also requires the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan agency that produces reports on a wide variety of procedural and policy topics, to post all of its reports online. Currently, only some are available to the public, and mostly through third parties.\n\nFinally, the bill also included the Fix NICS Act, a proposal that will reinforce the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), the system gun sellers use to verify if someone is eligible to buy a gun. This bill increases enforcement, steps up requirements for federal and state agencies to update records, gives states financial incentives to report to NICS, and penalizes agencies that don\u2019t upload their records.\n\nAll around, a win for government databases.\n\nLoser: Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME)\nBack in the day ... in December, Sen. Susan Collins was promised a vote on two Obamacare stabilization bills in exchange for her vote on the GOP tax bill. She voted for the tax cuts, which also repealed the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate, the tax on individuals for not having health insurance that is projected expected to increase premiums by 10 percent.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t see a vote on the health care bills in return.\n\nThe latest iteration of the Obamacare stabilization package, which Collins co-sponsored with Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), would have funded the cost-sharing reduction subsidies, which help insurance companies keep down premium costs, for three years, and also pumped billions of dollars for reinsurance funding, which essentially backstops insurance companies expenses with high-cost patients. The idea was to put it in the spending bill.\n\nBut the White House and Republican leadership also included language that would prevent the Obamacare payments from going toward any insurance plan that covers abortions \u2014 which Democrats said would adversely impact low-income women. Neither party was willing to concede, and the Obamacare stabilization funding was dropped altogether.\n\nCollins will have to wait another day to see her long-promised Obamacare stabilization package get a vote.\n\nWinner: federally funded research\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Andy Buchanan/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s budget proposal\u2019s efforts to cut research funding, Congress invested in more federally funded research over past year and loosened restrictions on what federal agencies can research.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health got a $3 billion funding increase for medical research, which both parties have touted as a win. It brings total funding for the agency to $37 billion and includes an additional $414 million for Alzheimer\u2019s research, $140 million more for brain research, and $40 million more for universal flu vaccine research.\n\nThis spending bill was also a small victory for gun violence research. For years, Congress has more or less banned the Center for Disease Control, or any federal agency, from using taxpayer money on public health research about firearms. Technically, the Dickey Amendment barred the CDC from spending any money \u201cto advocate or promote gun control\u201d \u2014 a provision the federal agency largely interpreted as an outright ban.\n\nBut the spending bill clarifies that the law doesn\u2019t actually prevent them from doing the research \u2014 the result of a larger debate Congress has been having about gun control after the tragic school shooting in Parkland, Florida.\n\nLoser: conservatives\nWhen it comes to bipartisan pieces of legislation, conservative lawmakers usually get rolled. In the days leading up to the spending bill\u2019s release, they knew this time would be no different.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the Freedom Caucus, a group of the House\u2019s most conservative lawmakers, to come out against the bill, calling it an \u201cinsult to America\u2019s taxpayers, as well as their many rank-and-file representatives who had no say in the omnibus negotiations,\u201d in a statement less than an hour after the bill was released. \n\nThe Heritage Foundation, one of Washington\u2019s leading conservative think tanks, had a similar sentiment, tweeting that the omnibus was an \u201cembarrassing rundown of broken promises.\u201d \n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-TN) a deficit hawk, called it \u201cgrotesque,\u201d and Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) took it one step further saying the bill was a \u201cgreat-dane-sized whiz down the leg of every taxpayer in this country.\u201d \n\nTheir reactions are no surprise. The $1.3 trillion spending package is a far cry from conservatives\u2019 calls for small government, and almost every contentious conservative policy provision got tossed out \u2014 from defunding Planned Parenthood to defunding sanctuary cities.\n\nInstead, the final bill barely included conservative immigration policies (the $1.6 billion in border wall funding came with a lot of restrictions). And it didn\u2019t pair any expansion of concealed-carry gun laws to the Fix NICS proposal, a light gun control bill that reinforces existing laws around background checks. \n\nNot to mention that conservatives in the Freedom Caucus claim to be process hawks, who like to see bills go through regular order. (Of course, they were less interested in this when it came to tax cuts and repealing Obamacare.) And this massive spending bill was dropped less than 18 hours before the final House vote.\n\nWinner: tipped workers\nIn December, Trump\u2019s Labor Department Secretary Alex Acosta proposed a plan that would essentially allow employers to confiscate their workers\u2019 tips if they pay workers minimum wage or above.\n\nThe proposal would have repealed an Obama-era regulation that gave workers sole propriety over the tips they earned. As Vox\u2019s Alexia Fernandez Campbell explained, the Trump administration\u2019s proposed move could have cost service workers $5.8 billion a year in lost tips.\n\nTo preemptively protect workers, an amendment in the spending bill from Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) will bar employers from taking their workers\u2019 tips. The provision was a major win for service workers, who came out in droves against the Labor Department\u2019s proposed rule change \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t completely void Azar\u2019s proposal. Employers will still be allowed to share a worker\u2019s tips with a larger pool of workers if they are paid the full minimum wage. \n\nHonorable Mention Winner: Sen. James Risch\u2019s ego\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        McConnell begged Risch to allow a vote.\n      \n      \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nAs lawmakers scrambled to get the spending bill passed, the final obstacle wasn\u2019t over funding or policy: Sen. James Risch (R-ID) had a personal gripe with a provision that renamed the White Clouds Wilderness after four-term Gov. Cecil D. Andrus, who died last year \u2014 Risch\u2019s rival.\n\nWhile it\u2019s still unclear how toxic Andrus and Risch\u2019s relationship was, several reports indicate the two clashed over education policy in the 1980s. Apparently, Risch had held enough of a grudge that he didn\u2019t want the Idaho wilderness named after the man.\n\nRisch did not know about the provision \u2014 which had been sponsored by Republican Idaho Rep. Mike Simpson in the House \u2014 until late Thursday. He called on Republican leadership to remove the language and refused to consent to a vote on the final bill. But it was too late to change the bill; removing the language would require the House to vote on the bill again and drag out the process.\n\nAfter much \u201cbegging, pleading, and cajoling\u201d on McConnell\u2019s part \u2014 a private meeting with staff and the senator, with Schumer, Republican leadership, a floor fight and even a phone call to House Speaker Paul Ryan \u2014 the Senate finally voted without removing the provision. The compromise, approved quietly and quickly by unanimous consent: An enrollment correction to the omnibus, which the House will consider later. \n\nRisch\u2019s tantrum dragged Senate proceedings passed midnight, angering lawmakers who were dragged out of bed at 1 am to vote. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) called it \u201cthe most like a Saturday Night Live skit\u201d she\u2019s ever witnessed in her 12 years in the Senate.\n\nRisch is expected to take over one of the Senate\u2019s top committees as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee next year.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Zack Beauchamp", "body": "Rep. Devin Nunes\u2019s infamous memo \u2014 the document numerous House Republicans claimed would demonstrate fundamental anti-Trump corruption at the FBI \u2014 was released early Friday afternoon. The entire thing is three and a half pages and only takes a few minutes to read closely and carefully.\nAfter doing that, there is only one conclusion a fair reader could draw: There is absolutely nothing here. \nThere is no proof in the memo that the FBI is biased against Trump, no proof of abuse of surveillance powers by the FBI, and no proof that the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia are fundamentally flawed. The memo is a piece of partisan spin, and not a particularly compelling one at that.\nRepublicans who claimed it was anything else have been egregiously misrepresenting what the memo actually says.\nThe memo does not support its core claim\nThe memo begins by making a grandiose claim: The FBI\u2019s use of surveillance power under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) during the 2016 campaign was \u201ca troubling breakdown of legal processes established to protect the American people from abuses related to the FISA process.\u201d\nThe only example the memo cites is an October 21, 2016, request by the Department of Justice and FBI for permission under FISA powers to snoop on former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page. The key word there is former: Page had left the Trump campaign at least a month before the application. That\u2019s the first red flag that there\u2019s nothing here, as an FBI campaign to undermine Trump\u2019s campaign would almost certainly involve targeting someone who was actually working on it.\nThe Nunes memo goes on to allege the the Page FISA application, which was ultimately approved by a judge, was fundamentally flawed. The problem, it claims, is that the application depended on \u201cthe Steele Dossier,\u201d a document put together by former British spy Christopher Steele alleging deep ties between Trump and Russia (it\u2019s the source of, among other things, the \u201cpee tape\u201d rumors about Trump and Moscow prostitutes).\nThe Steele Dossier, Nunes alleges, \u201cformed an essential part of the Carter Page application,\u201d and Nunes goes on to suggest that the application omitted several key facts about the Steele Dossier that undermine its credibility: Most notably that the dossier was partially funded by the Democratic National Committee and that Steele himself has expressed his opposition to Donald Trump becoming president.\nWe can\u2019t check whether these claims are true without seeing the actual FISA application. It could be that the Steele Dossier wasn\u2019t very important to the Page application, or that the FBI actually did disclose Steele\u2019s political connections. (This is apparently the argument in a Democratic counter-memo, which was not published because Republicans voted to keep it secret.\nThe Nunes memo, in other words, could be full of lies. We just can\u2019t tell based on reading it.\nBut let\u2019s assume that its core factual assertions \u2014 the FBI heavily relied on the Steele Dossier, and that it didn\u2019t mention his funding sources in the FISA warrant \u2014 are true. So what?\nThe FBI relies on sources with axes to grind all the time. People typically don\u2019t go to the authorities with damaging information about people they like. The key questions in an application like this isn\u2019t whether the source liked the target; it\u2019s whether the specific claims they\u2019re making are credible.\nThe memo doesn\u2019t do make that case.\n\u201cWhat matters is whether the Steele specific findings *actually material to the application* were unverified,\u201d Julian Sanchez, an expert on surveillance at the libertarian Cato Institute, wrote after reading the memo. \u201cMemo doesn\u2019t seem to make that claim.\u201d\nThe memo insinuates a lot \u2014 and proves virtually nothing\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThis fits with the memo\u2019s overall method of argument, which is to imply something suspicious without outright asserting malfeasance.\nFor example, the memo repeatedly notes that the DOJ knew that \u201cpolitical actors\u201d were involved in the financing the Steele Dossier. It implies that the FBI knew they were Democrats and chose to ignore it.\nBut it never outright asserts that, and for good reason. The firm that employed Steele was initially contracted by a conservative publication, the Washington Free Beacon, not any Democrat or Democratic political campaign. It\u2019s possible the FBI knew of the Free Beacon\u2019s involvement or just generally that some political actor was involved in funding it \u2014 but didn\u2019t know about the Clinton campaign\u2019s involvement. The memo never clarifies which \u201cpolitical actors\u201d it means.\nSimilarly, the memo notes that various important people, including former FBI Director James Comey and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, reapproved the FISA surveillance after the initial application. The implication is that these people were either incompetent, because they failed to notice the omissions in the application, or complicit in an effort to deceive the court.\nBut there\u2019s another possibility that\u2019s left unmentioned: Perhaps the FISA surveillance on Page revealed disturbing Russian connections that warranted continued surveillance. Page had a longtime history of connections with the Russian government\u2014 so much so that in 2013, Russian agents approached him with the intent of turning him into an asset (a point the Nunes memo never notes).\nThis, experts say, is almost certainly what happened.\n\u201cIt\u2019s reapproved if you have new information justifying the original probable cause and the government\u2019s need to listen,\u201d writes Asha Rangappa, a former FBI special agent and current Yale Law professor. \u201cKind of the point of requiring the extension. Sounds like the gov [made] its burden not once, but THREE times.\u201d\nAnd ... that\u2019s it, really. \nThe memo doesn\u2019t prove its core claim, that there were real omissions in the FISA application related to the Steele Dossier \u2014 it merely asserts them. Nor does it contain any evidence that these omissions, if they were made intentionally, undermine the validity of the FISA warrant. There\u2019s just no there there.\n\u201cIf this is their evidence of \u2018Worse than Watergate,\u2019 it\u2019s thin,\u201d Sanchez concludes. \u201cThis reads like something you\u2019d put together to *sound* scandalous to someone who isn\u2019t going to parse it closely.\u201d\nThe memo actually exculpates the Russia investigation\nRepublicans have been selling this memo politically as devastating proof of anti-Trump animus at the FBI\u2019s upper echelons and in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said its content justified a \u201ccleanse\u201d of the FBI.\nIf the memo can\u2019t stand up its specific allegations about the Page FISA application, it clearly can\u2019t stand up an allegation this broad and deep. Some of the pre-release speculation about the memo\u2019s contents, like the notion that it would have embarrassing information about Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, clearly didn\u2019t pan out.\nIn fact, the memo concludes on a note that actually should vindicate the broader Russia investigation.\nThe last paragraph of the memo is all about the FISA application\u2019s references to George Papadopoulos. The Trump campaign foreign-policy advisor also had connections with Russia \u2014 he had been approached by a Russian-linked professor in London in the spring of 2016 who told him the Kremlin had dirt on Hillary Clinton \u2014 and was also under FBI suspicion. \nThe memo admits, crucially, that the Trump-Russia investigation was based in part by Papadopoulos\u2019s misbehavior, not Page\u2019s. \u201cThe Papadopoulos information,\u201d the memo admits, \u201ctriggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016.\u201d\nThe reason this matters is because it shows that, even if the Carter Page FISA application were flawed, the Trump-Russia investigation had another foundation \u2014 evidence about Papadopoulos\u2019s Russian contacts. That means you can\u2019t discredit the entire Russia investigation by pointing to the Page warrant.\nThe memo tries to insinuate that this too was biased against Trump \u2014 noting that one of the FBI agents handling the Papadopoulos situation, Peter Strzok, had sent some text messages critical of Trump to his \u201cmistress,\u201d FBI attorney Lisa Page. \nBut at this point, we know that the information on Papadopoulos was legit \u2014 because he pled guilty to lying to the FBI and gave a ton of information to Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s office. Papadopoulos admitted, among other things, that a Russian-linked professor had told him that the Russians had \u201cthousands\u201d of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. Papadopoulos is a key witness in the Trump-Russia case, and Page hasn\u2019t even been indicted \u2014 suggesting the case indeed rests on solid ground.\nThe Nunes memo, in short, is long on assertions and short on evidence \u2014 and, by the end, it has fatally undermined its own reason for existing, providing political ammunition against the Russia investigation. If the president, House Republicans, or Fox News try to use this as a justification for some kind of purge at the FBI, then you can be sure of one thing: They\u2019re totally disconnected from the facts.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Emily Stewart", "body": "On Friday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, allegedly for misleading investigators about authorizing a conversation between FBI officials and Wall Street Journal reporters in 2016. It was intended to rebut allegations he had slowed down an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. According to the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, McCabe allowed two top FBI officials to speak to reporters; in an internal review afterward, the former deputy director apparently displayed a \u201clack of candor\u201d about the affair, which is a fireable offense at the Bureau \u2014 and which was why Sessions decided to oust him. \n\nThat decision has prompted a number of questions, including whether McCabe\u2019s firing was politically motivated \u2014 or performed at the urging of President Donald Trump \u2014 and why it was done so vindictively, taking place as it did just two days before McCabe would have been eligible to receive a full federal pension after more than 20 years of service. Another question has begun to percolate as well: Should Sessions, who recused himself from all matters related to the 2016 presidential campaign \u2014 which included anything involving the Clinton Foundation \u2014 have been able to fire McCabe at all? \n\nSessions said he\u2019d stay away from all things Clinton Foundation at his confirmation hearing\nWriting at the New York University School of Law-based blog Just Security, Ryan Goodman, a professor of law at New York University, made the argument on Saturday that Sessions violated his promise recuse himself from matters involving the 2016 election \u2014 a decision Trump had been furious about for quite some time. \n\n\u201cSome might contend that Sessions\u2019 recusal covered only the Clinton and Trump campaigns, and that McCabe\u2019s firing involved the Clinton Foundation investigation as a separate matter,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut Sessions unequivocally assured senators of his intentions during his confirmation hearings in response to a clear and specific question from the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA). Sen. Grassley asked a follow-up question that went right to the point. In response, Sessions very clearly said his recusal would cover any matters involving the Clinton Foundation.\u201d\n\nGoodman points specifically to an exchange between Sessions and Grassley during Sessions\u2019 confirmation hearing to become US attorney general. This is the exchange (Goodman\u2019s emphasis in bold):\n\n\nGRASSLEY: During the course of the presidential campaign, you made a number of statements about the investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, relating to her handling of sensitive emails and regarding certain actions of the Clinton Foundation. You weren\u2019t alone in that criticism. I was certainly critical in the same way as were millions of Americans on those matters, but now, you\u2019ve been nominated to serve as attorney general. In light of those comments that you made, some have expressed concerns about whether you can approach the Clinton matter impartially in both fact and appearance. How do you plan to address those concerns?\n\nSESSIONS: Mr. Chairman, it was a highly contentious campaign. I, like a lot of people, made comments about the issues in that campaign. With regard to Secretary Clinton and some of the comments I made, I do believe that that could place me objectivity in question. I\u2019ve given that thought.\n\nI believe the proper thing for me to do, would be to recuse myself from any questions involving those kind of investigations that involve Secretary Clinton and that were raised during the campaign or to be otherwise connected to it.\n\nGRASSLEY: OK. I think, that\u2019s \u2014 let me emphasize then with a follow up question. To be very clear, you intend to recuse yourself from both the Clinton e-mail investigation and any matters involving the Clinton Foundation, if there are any?\n\nSESSIONS: Yes.\n\n\nThat, according to Goodman, is enough to determine that Sessions shouldn\u2019t have fired McCabe, as the former FBI deputy director\u2019s misdeeds were related to the Clinton Foundation. \u201cIf it is a close call whether the Clinton Foundation matter is sufficiently connected to the Clinton campaign for purpose of understanding Sessions\u2019 recusal, it should be deemed to be sufficiently connected. After all, that\u2019s essentially what Sessions told Sen. Grassley,\u201d Goodman writes. \u201cSecond, if the Clinton Foundation matter is deemed outside the scope of the recusal statement that Sessions made back in March last year, then his decision to fire McCabe shows that he failed to honor the promise for a broader recusal which he clearly made to the Senate in its decision to confirm him as Attorney General.\u201d \n\nThis is not the first time Sessions has been accused of violating his recusal pledge. A watchdog group filed a complaint with the Justice Department in May alleging that his participation in the firing of former FBI Director James Comey was a violation of his pledge to recuse himself from matters involving Russia, asking that the department investigate the matter, issue a public report, and take additional action if deemed appropriate. A similar request could presumably be made here, or a Congressional oversight body could take action, but with Republicans in control of the House of Representatives and the Senate, it is unlikely there would be much impetus to do so. \n\nI spoke to legal experts about Sessions\u2019 decision to fire McCabe. Their responses were mixed.\nI asked five legal experts whether they believe Sessions violated his recusal promise by firing McCabe. Some said that he did, while others said they would need more information to decide. \n\nHere are the facts as we know them: McCabe used the FBI press office to authorize a bureau lawyer and spokesperson to speak to the Wall Street Journal for a 2016 story about infighting in the FBI over how to handle investigations into Hillary Clinton, a story that included her use of email as secretary of state and the Clinton Foundation. Specifically, McCabe authorized officials to push back against allegations that he had slowed down an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. As the New York Times notes, the article says that McCabe insisted his agents had the authority to investigate the foundation even if the Justice Department wouldn\u2019t authorize grand jury subpoenas. \n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report on exactly what happened after hasn\u2019t been released, but it reportedly determines McCabe lacked candor with internal investigators when asked about disclosures to the Wall Street Journal. The question about Sessions now is whether the Clinton Foundation tie-in is enough to have forced the Attorney General to recuse himself from dealing with the McCabe affair. \n\nKathleen Clarke, a law professor at Washington University and an expert in ethics, said in an email she agrees with Goodman\u2019s analysis that Sessions did break his recusal promise. \u201cSessions promised to recuse from \u2018any matters involving the Clinton Foundation,\u2019 yet he failed to recuse from the decision of how (if at all) McCabe should be disciplined in connection with the Justice Department\u2019s investigation of the Clinton Foundation,\u201d she said.\n\nDavid Sklansky, a Standford law professor, concurred \u2014 Sessions himself has publicly recognized he can\u2019t be impartial when it comes to Clinton-related matters, which presumably includes the McCabe firing. \u201cIf the basis for firing McCabe has anything to do with actions he took in connection with investigations of either the Clinton Foundation or Secretary Clinton\u2019s email server, then the participation of Attorney General Sessions in the decision does appear to break the promise he made to Congress during his confirmation hearings,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cHe promised to recuse himself from any participation in these investigations, because \u2014 as even Sessions recognized \u2014 there was serious reason to doubt he could be impartial, given the active role he had played in the Trump campaign. And recusal means recusal: it means he has to take himself completely out of the chain of decision.\u201d\n\nCarl Tobias, law professor at the University of Richmond, said the Senate should act. \u201cIf Sessions violated the recusal promise, the [Senate Judiciary Committee] would have to agree to act on that, but the panel may split along party lines,\u201d he said in an email. \n\nMichael Horowitz, the Justice Department\u2019s Inspector General, provided a report to the Department of Justice determining that McCabe made an \u201cunauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor,\u201d according to Sessions\u2019 statement on the decision to fire McCabe, but the report hasn\u2019t been made public yet, making it hard to determine the merits of Sessions\u2019 decision. If the decision was made based not on the Clinton Foundation investigation but instead relates solely to McCabe\u2019s conduct in making misleading comments regarding that investigation, then the argument could be made that he didn\u2019t violate his recusal after all.\n\n\u201cThat would help, so we could see the reasoning behind the firing to see if it is persuasive,\u201d Tobias, from the University of Richmond, said. House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Adam Schiff (D-CA) made a similar observation on Twitter.\n\n\n\nIn the absence of the IG report, it\u2019s impossible to evaluate the merits of this harsh treatment of a 21-year FBI professional. That it comes after the President urged the DOJ to deprive McCabe of his pension, and after his testimony, gives the action an odious taint. https://t.co/rpZqqxFp4u\n\u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) March 17, 2018\n\n\n\n\nMcCabe\u2019s firing could be viewed as an \u201cinternal disciplinary matter\u201d given the inspector general\u2019s findings and the recommendation from the FBI\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility that he be fired, said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University. But Sessions could have stepped aside just in case. \u201cA solid argument could have been made to defer to [Deputy Attorney General] Rod Rosenstein given McCabe\u2019s role on the Russia investigation,\u201d Turley wrote. \u201cHowever, there is a good-faith basis for acting on the question.\u201d\n\nIt is also worth noting that while Sessions said he would recuse himself from anything related to the Clinton Foundation in his exchange with Grassley, his official recusal statement only mentions the 2016 campaign. \u201cThere is a difference in what Mr. Sessions said he would do when testifying before Congress and his official recusal letter,\u201d Andrea Curcio, a law professor at Georgia State University, told me. \n\nThere is plenty that is legally questionable about the decision to fire Sessions, however:  Trump\u2019s sustained attack on McCabe, including on Saturday, and the rushed manner in which the Department of Justice fired McCabe in order to strip him of his pension bring Sessions\u2019 motivations into question. \n\nCurcio, an evidence professor and former litigator, said the timing of McCabe\u2019s firing \u2014 just two days before his pension vests \u2014 could create a showdown if the matter ends up in court. \u201c[It] sets up a great cross examination if McCabe\u2019s testimony is unfavorable to the Trump administration,\u201d she said. \u201cThe loss of his pension as a motivating factor for any unfavorable testimony now becomes fertile ground for a withering cross examination.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matthew Yglesias", "body": "It did not attract a ton of attention at the time (nothing does these days) but about a year ago on February 28, 2017, Congress passed and Donald Trump signed a law revoking an Obama-era regulatory initiative that made it harder for people with mental illness to buy a gun. \nYet despite this effort to roll back even a very modest effort to restrain the ability of seriously incapacitated people from obtaining deadly weapons, this morning Trump tweeted that there were \u201cso many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed,\u201d implying that someone should have done something to report him.\n\n\nSo many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior.

The Obama-era gun regulation wouldn\u2019t have had a massive impact on gun violence in the US since it\u2019s estimated that it would only affect about 75,000 people. And disability rights groups had their own objections to the bill so some liberal groups joined with the National Rifle Association in urging Trump to reverse it.\nBut anything that makes it easier to obtain a gun, the research suggests, will likely worsen gun violence. After all, America already has some of the weakest gun laws in the developed world \u2014 and repealing a rule that made it a little tougher for some people to buy a gun likely makes that worse.\nThe rule tasked the Social Security Administration with turning over information to the FBI\nThe vote was part of a larger suite of Congressional Review Act measures that passed early in the Trump administration. The CRA allows Congress to overrule recently enacted regulatory initiatives passed by the executive branch. CRA bills can\u2019t be filibustered, but they do need to be signed by the president. \nConsequently, the CRA is rarely used since the president isn\u2019t going to sign a measure blocking his own regulations. But in the first year of the Trump administration, the CRA was used to reverse a whole suite of final-year Obama regulations. These reversals mostly made life easier for polluters but also let Internet Service Providers sell your web browsing data to advertisers and made it easier for people with severe mental illness to buy guns.\nSpecifically, what Obama did was order to Social Security Administration to take the list of people who were deemed so severely mentally ill that they are unfit to handle their own disability benefits and forward it to the FBI. The FBI was then supposed to incorporate that list in the background checks used to disqualify people from gun ownership. \nThis is obviously an extremely narrow measure that wouldn\u2019t have had enormous impact one way or the other \u2014 it just represented Obama\u2019s limited capacity to do anything on guns in the face of relentless congressional opposition.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "German Lopez", "body": "For decades, the federal government, with the support of the National Rifle Association, has made it very difficult to answer a question at the heart of American public health and safety: Does gun control work?\n\nThe answer is hugely important given that guns killed nearly 39,000 Americans in 2016 alone. But after research on gun violence in the 1990s found that firearms do not \u2014 contrary to NRA talking points \u2014 make people safer, the group backed a federal funding freeze on gun policy research. \n\nBut studies have gone on \u2014 just without federal funding. And on Friday, a nonpartisan think tank, the RAND Corporation, released the results so far of its Gun Policy in America initiative, a two-year dive into the research on gun violence and the laws trying to curtail it.\n\nRAND\u2019s extensive report does not make any sweeping declarations about gun policy. It does, however, make clear that gun control research is very limited, calling on Congress to lift the NRA-backed funding freeze. It argues that this freeze has, by making it difficult to conduct better studies, led to a confusing empirical environment, where it\u2019s easy for groups on both sides of the debate to cite shoddy work that supports their prior beliefs.\n\n\u201cThe studies that have been done often reach opposite conclusions to each other,\u201d Andrew Morral, the head of RAND\u2019s gun policy initiative, told me.

While RAND as a nonpartisan group avoided any sweeping policy conclusions in its analysis, its review does seem to point in a direction, based on my own reading: More permissive gun policies lead to more gun deaths, while more restrictive policies lead to fewer gun deaths. Coupled with other evidence in this area, that supports the idea that more guns lead to more gun deaths.\n\nGiven that America is dealing with an immediate gun violence problem, as mass shootings and deaths pile up, the report is worth taking seriously. At the very least, there\u2019s enough evidence to suggest that the federal government should stop refusing to fund research on policies that really could work to save thousands of lives every year.\n\nThe available research points in one direction\nRAND\u2019s report does not come out in favor of more or less gun control. Instead, the team compiled the best research that\u2019s available so far into charts and in-depth evaluations \u2014 the result of a review of dozens of studies, focused on 13 policies and eight outcomes. Here are the overall findings, which only included studies that met RAND\u2019s rigorous standards:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nThe RAND report emphasizes that much of the research on gun policy is still in its infancy. You can see that in the chart above in all the white and gray space \u2014 we still don\u2019t have answers to a lot of important questions when it comes to gun policy, including the effects on defensive gun use, hunting and recreation, and police shootings.\n\nBut the answers we do have point in one direction. On the gun control front, there\u2019s moderate evidence that background checks reduce suicide and violent crime, limited evidence that prohibitions associated with mental illness reduce suicide, moderate evidence that those prohibitions reduce violent crime, and supportive evidence that child-access prevention laws reduce suicides and unintentional injuries and deaths. \n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s limited evidence that concealed carry laws increase violent crime and unintentional injuries and deaths. And there\u2019s moderate evidence that \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws \u2014 NRA-backed measures that expand when someone can use a gun or other weapons to defend himself \u2014 increase violent crime.\n\nIf you put this all together, it suggests that restrictive laws seem to lead to fewer gun deaths, while the permissive laws seem to lead to more gun deaths.\n\nThat\u2019s not enough for nonpartisan researchers at RAND to make sweeping conclusions, but it\u2019s certainly suggestive \u2014 particularly for policymakers interested in finding solutions to America\u2019s gun violence problem as soon as possible.\n\nStill, the research is far from ideal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to claim a general truth from this yet,\u201d Morral said. \u201cThere\u2019s been so little research that we\u2019re really at the mercy of a few studies. If we could fill every cell in the empty table that we put up, I don\u2019t know if we would see the same thing. But it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out here that RAND\u2019s standards are fairly high. For example, it deemed an oft-cited study from Missouri \u201cinconclusive.\u201d That study found that when Missouri repealed its handgun licensing law in 2007, firearm homicides \u2014 but not other types of homicides \u2014 rose significantly. That certainly suggests that the law led to an immediate increase in homicides.\n\nBut RAND\u2019s team was more cautious. For one, Missouri also passed its \u201cstand your ground\u201d law in 2007. Could that explain the rise in homicides, given the evidence that \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws increase violent crime? RAND\u2019s team wasn\u2019t convinced that the Missouri study completely ruled that out, given some of its methodological limitations.\n\nRAND also excluded foreign studies in its official synthesis (although it did include a few foreign studies in brief essays). Some of these studies have compelling evidence for gun restrictions, but RAND\u2019s team argued that the US is too unusual for those other findings to cleanly apply.\n\nAnother major area of limitation was the way the science itself was done. Studies try to find what\u2019s known as statistical significance \u2014 essentially, an effect that\u2019s large enough that it\u2019s unlikely to be just a statistical anomaly. Because of this, it can be difficult to find small effects in a scientifically reliable manner. \n\nAnd in gun policy, a small effect could actually be huge, RAND noted: \u201cFor example, a 3-percent reduction in firearm deaths corresponds to 1,000 fewer deaths per year nationally.\u201d\n\nThis problem could be overcome with better, more rigorous research. But because the studies were often dealing with limited data and methodologies, many of them couldn\u2019t work through these problems.\n\nOverall, the research that RAND included in its analysis \u2014 and deemed reliable \u2014 just did not answer many questions to the team\u2019s satisfaction, even if the evidence appears suggestive to you or me.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say RAND itself made no conclusions. The think tank found supportive evidence for child access prevention laws reducing suicide and unintentional injuries and deaths. And Morral agreed that the evidence is stronger on background checks and prohibitions associated with mental illness than other gun policies.\n\nBut Morral and RAND weren\u2019t comfortable reaching the conclusions that I\u2019ve made after seeing their findings.\n\nExperts on both sides are split on key issues\nUnsatisfied with the state of the research, RAND tried to find other sources for answers. So it turned to gun policy experts.\n\n\u201cGiven that there\u2019s a fair amount that\u2019s not been studied but matters in these gun policy debates, we believed that policymakers and the public tend to turn to experts \u2014 researchers, but also policy analysts at advocacy organizations,\u201d Morral said. \u201cAnd so we wanted to understand, in the absence of a real consensus around lots of the potential effects of these policies, what do the experts from these two different sides believe those effects are?\u201d\n\nRAND surveyed experts about 15 policies, splitting them into two camps: those who support more restrictive gun policies, and those who support more permissive policies. The full results are available over at RAND\u2019s website, which compiled them into interactive maps.\n\nHere are the survey\u2019s overall findings for firearm homicides:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nThere\u2019s some obvious disagreement here. Those in the more restrictive camp said that restrictive policies would reduce homicides and more permissive measures would have the opposite effect. Those on the more permissive side said that restrictive policies would have little to no effect, while permissive policies would reduce homicides.\n\nAnd if you implemented all 15 policies included in the survey, both sides said that gun homicides would fall.\n\nOne caveat to the survey results: \u201cThese are really back-of-the-envelope calculations,\u201d Morral said. So the exact percentages in the maps should not be taken too literally, but the general trends do at least give some guidance for where experts land on these issues.\n\nThere were some big points of agreement: Both sides agreed on the effects of forcing prohibited possessors to give up firearms, expanded mental health prohibitions, and a child access prevention media campaign, concluding that such measures would reduce gun deaths overall.\n\nAnother point of agreement: gun suicides, which killed 59 percent more people in the US than gun homicides in 2016. Both sides said, on average, that more restrictive gun policies would reduce firearm suicides \u2014 saving at least thousands of lives annually.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nThe survey also exposed why the different sides disagree on these issues. According to RAND, it\u2019s not that both sides have totally different values \u2014 that the permissive side, for example, believes that gun rights are important even if they increase firearm homicides. \n\nInstead, both sides generally agree that the top concerns are public health and safety outcomes. It\u2019s just that they disagree on which policies are more effective at doing that \u2014 the permissive side genuinely believes that more permissive gun policies could save lives, while the more restrictive side genuinely believes that more restrictive policies could save lives.\n\nOne reason for the difference may be conflicting beliefs about what RAND characterized as a substitution effect. The report explained: \n\nThe median respondent with more-permissive regulatory preferences indicated that if a policy successfully reduced a state\u2019s firearm suicides, 90 percent of the prevented suicides would still end as a suicide by some other means. In contrast, the median respondent with more-restrictive regulatory preferences responded that 20 percent would still end as a suicide. They produced the same stark differences in expected substitution of means for firearm homicides: 90 percent for those favoring permissive policies, and 20 percent for those favoring restrictive policies. Those who favor permissive policies view reductions of firearm suicides and homicides as largely futile efforts because these outcomes will continue, largely uninhibited, through other means. \n\nThere is some evidence for the more restrictive side here. Consider suicide: It tends to be fairly impulsive, with people often deciding to kill themselves and acting on it within hours. But if they don\u2019t have a gun around, maybe they\u2019ll give up on it altogether. Or if they reach for other means, those are simply going to be much less deadly than a firearm \u2014 while the death rate of suicide attempts with guns is above 90 percent, the death rate with other means can drop to below 10 percent.\n\nRegardless, disagreement over the substitution effect helps explain why smart people on both sides can have such different views on gun policy.\n\nMore guns, more gun deaths?\nOutside of RAND\u2019s research, there has been a lot of evidence that there is a correlation between the availability of guns and more gun deaths.\n\nThe research, compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health\u2019s Injury Control Research Center, is pretty clear: After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths.\n\n\u201cWithin the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide,\u201d David Hemenway, the Injury Control Research Center\u2019s director, wrote in Private Guns, Public Health.\n\nFor example, a 2013 study, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, found that, after controlling for multiple variables, a 1 percent increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate at the state level.\n\nThis chart, based on data from researcher Josh Tewksbury, shows the correlation between the number of guns and gun deaths among wealthier nations, demonstrating that the US in particular has way more guns and gun deaths than its developed peers:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nThere\u2019s good reason to believe, too, that guns are to blame here. As a breakthrough analysis by UC Berkeley\u2019s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins in 1999 found, it\u2019s not even that the US has more crime than other developed countries. This chart, based on data from Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University, shows that the US is not an outlier when it comes to overall crime:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nInstead, the US appears to have more lethal violence \u2014 and that\u2019s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns.\n\n\u201dA series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,\u201d Zimring and Hawkins wrote. \u201cA preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nThis is in many ways intuitive: People of every country get into arguments and fights with friends, family, and peers. But in the US, it\u2019s much more likely that someone will get angry at an argument and be able to pull out a gun and kill someone.\n\nRAND takes a more skeptical view. The report argued that it can be hard to disentangle the relationship between more guns and more gun deaths: Is it the abundance of guns leading to more gun deaths, or are people seeing a lot of violence in their communities and reacting to it by stocking up on guns to protect themselves? RAND concluded that there\u2019s just not enough in the research it reviewed to solve this chicken-or-egg scenario.\n\nStill, when RAND\u2019s findings are coupled with other studies we have, there\u2019s some suggestive evidence that easy access to guns is the cause here.\n\nTake the research on gun control measures more broadly, including the foreign studies that RAND left out. A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries published in Epidemiologic Reviews, for example, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence. That\u2019s a very strong indicator that it\u2019s the guns that are causing the deaths, since restrictions on guns were followed by a drop in violence. And it comes from very big, reliable meta-analysis.\n\nBut as RAND points out, things are less clear when trying to gauge how well specific policies would work in more exact terms, particularly in a US context.\n\nAmerica has a ton of guns \u2014 by far more than any other country in the world; it\u2019s an open question how you go about reducing or restricting a stockpile so large. \n\nWould people react violently to a mandatory buyback program similar to the one Australia used to confiscate guns? Would a universal background check system have a big impact, given that people could potentially get around it in the underground markets by simply trading the many firearms already in circulation? If America required licensing and registration for guns, how would it ensure that people who already own weapons get the proper license and registration filed?\n\nThe research \u2014 including some of RAND\u2019s findings \u2014 suggests that these three policies would likely reduce gun deaths to some extent. The question is just how big the effect would be and which policies would be the most effective \u2014 a very important question if the US is ever going to bring gun violence down to European levels.\n\nWe need more research\nAll of that is to say that more research is needed. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so bad that the federal government, typically a major facilitator of studies, has for decades refused to fund the research.\n\nStateline staff writer Michael Ollove, citing a recent study in JAMA, summarized the problem: \u201cThe study said that gun violence research received a paltry 1.6 percent of the [federal] funding ($22 million) that would be predicted ($1.4 billion) based on the number of deaths caused by guns \u2014 36,252 in 2015, according to the CDC.\u201d\n\nIn the absence of the federal government, RAND is stepping in to try to help out researchers. It put up a database of gun laws, which it hopes will help researchers conduct more accurate analyses of the effects of such laws. It also put out a lengthy, wonky set of recommendations for improving the methodology of research into this area. (Be warned: Unless you\u2019re a statistician or pretty familiar with statistics, much of it will go over your head.)\n\nThis all goes to addressing one of the key problems with the lack of federal funding: Since it can be difficult to get money for gun research, it\u2019s hard to build up correct data sets and thorough methodologies when conducting studies. After all, these are things that are not only time-consuming but financially costly as well \u2014 it\u2019s not cheap to run big surveys across the country.\n\n\u201cWe have not been collecting some of the right data to do these analyses well,\u201d Morral said. So researchers often rely on limited data just because it\u2019s what\u2019s available.\n\nAs an example: Several studies looking at the effects of concealed carry permits looked at firearm homicides in general. But what a researcher should ideally want to look at in this area is the effect of firearm homicides outside the home, since that\u2019s where people really use those permits. The data, however, often can\u2019t be broken up like that.\n\nFederal funding could go to surveys and on-the-ground research that could help address the gaps.\n\nThe funding is something, however, that pro-gun groups like the NRA have worked against for years. And so far, their tactics have worked \u2014 keeping the federal freeze in place. So although there\u2019s evidence that some gun control measures could work, we by and large remain blind to what specific solutions would work best and what all of their effects would be.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jane Coaston", "body": "After President Trump signed a massive 2,323-page omnibus spending bill on Friday \u2014 one which conservative publications deemed \u201can embarrassment and a disgrace\u201d and Trump had initially threatened to veto \u2014 many conservative pundits, including some of Trump\u2019s biggest fans, were incensed. \n\nThe bill gives a big boost to military funding (a major conservative point of emphasis), but it doesn\u2019t defund Planned Parenthood \u2014 a longtime GOP promise \u2014 and adds roughly $1 trillion to the deficit.

Reuters originally reported on the existence of the draft regulation Thursday.\nThe rule wouldn\u2019t make it illegal for immigrants to use public services that are open to everyone regardless of immigration status, or that are available to their US-born children. But it would make it possible for the government to deny their applications for a new type of visa, or a green card, if they\u2019d used those services. In other words, it could force them to choose between taking advantage of available social services, and their family\u2019s future ability to stay in the United States permanently.\nIf approved and finalized, the regulation would vastly expand the federal government\u2019s power to bar an immigrant from entering the United States, obtaining a new visa, or becoming a lawful permanent resident (green-card holder) by labeling the immigrant a likely \u201cpublic charge.\u201d\nRight now, the government can only consider use of cash benefits, like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, in \u201cpublic charge\u201d determinations. The Trump administration wants to give officials the power to look at use of other benefits as well, including: \n\nsome \u201ceducational benefits,\u201d including use of Head Start for children\nChildren\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)\nuse of any subsidies, or purchase of subsidized insurance, under the Affordable Care Act\nfood stamps\nWomen, Infants and Children (WIC) assistance\nHousing benefits, like Section 8\nLow-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)\ntransit vouchers\n\nUsing any of these for more than 6 months in the last two years (before applying for a different visa or a green card) would be considered a \u201cheavily weighted\u201d strike against the immigrant. (That strike could be canceled out if an immigrant was making more than 250 percent of the federal poverty level when applying for the new visa or green card \u2014 which, for a family of 4 in 2017, was $60,750.)\nGovernment officials already have a lot of discretion in who gets labeled a public charge, and use of public services is supposed to be only one factor among many. But the Trump administration\u2019s desire to expand it so radically indicates that they do, in fact, plan to reject visa or green card applications based on use of non-cash services and health insurance subsidies.\nImmigrants can get out of being considered a \u201cpublic charge\u201d if they have someone willing to sign an \u201caffidavit of support\u201d promising to support them at 125 percent of the federal poverty level. But the government doesn\u2019t have to agree to admit someone, or give them a green card, based on that affidavit.\nThe draft would allow an immigrant one other way to get out of a \u201cpublic charge\u201d bar: paying at least $10,000 in bond. But the Department of Homeland Security would have the power to decide whether to allow an immigrant to post bond. And if the immigrant used any public benefits in the five years after posting the bond, she\u2019d forfeit the whole $10,000.\nNot every immigrant has to pass the \u201cpublic charge\u201d test \u2014 refugees and asylees, for example, are exempt both when they come to the US and if they apply for green cards after that.

The House Republican caucus was itself victimized by a shooter last year in an incident that severely injured Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA), but that did nothing to alter Republicans\u2019 sincere belief that an abnormally high level of gun deaths is a price worth paying for strong gun rights. \nAnd then, of course, there\u2019s President Trump, who has an unusually close relationship with the National Rifle Association (despite his previous calls for an assault weapons ban) even by the standards of GOP presidents, because the group was one of the main pillars of the institutional Republican Party that stood by him even in the lowest moments of his 2016 presidential campaign. Indeed, the NRA is so firmly aligned with Trump that the FBI is now even looking into whether it was used as a cutout through which Russian money was sent to the Trump campaign.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Emily Stewart", "body": "If Saturday evening was any indication, we\u2019re in for many bonkers Trump rallies ahead of the 2018 and 2020 elections. Speaking for more than an hour to a crowd in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, President Donald Trump described newly announced tariffs his \u201cbaby,\u201d discussed executing drug dealers, described an NBC journalist as a \u201csleeping son of a bitch,\u201d and called a black congresswoman \u201clow IQ.\u201d \n\nTrump was in town to support Republican Rick Saccone, who is running against Democrat Conor Lamb to represent Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District in a special election slated for Tuesday. The seat was held by former Rep. Tim Murphy (R-PA), who resigned in October amid revelations that he had pressured a woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair to have an abortion. The race is unexpectedly tight.\n\nTrump endorsed Saccone early on in his speech before returning to the persona that became so familiar in the 2016 election \u2014 that of the unscripted, self-congratulatory candidate eager to rile up a crowd. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, this got us elected,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I came like a stiff, you guys wouldn\u2019t come here tonight.\u201d\n\nTrump brought up many of his favorite topics and insults during the freewheeling speech: He called Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) \u201cPocahontas,\u201d which some say is racist, bragged about his 2016 victory, and attacked the press. He also mentioned some relatively new items, which included a call to execute drug dealers. For the first time, however, President Trump publicly unveiled his 2020 campaign slogan: Keep America Great! \n\nHere\u2019s everything else you might have missed. \n\nTrump called for drug dealers to be executed\nEarlier this month at a White House summit on opioids, the president floated the idea of giving drug dealers the death penalty; on Saturday evening he brought it up again, which got some of the most enthusiastic cheers of the night. Drawing inspiration from China and Singapore \u2014 which he said have a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy and are extremely tough on drugs \u2014 Trump said drug dealers in the US should face harsher penalties than they do now. \n\n\u201dThey shoot one person, kill some person, knife one person, the person dies, they get maybe the death penalty or maybe life in prison, no parole, right? Okay? A drug dealer will kill 2,000, 3,000, 5,000 people during the course of his or her life,\u201d Trump said. He declared that the \u201conly way to solve a drug problem is through toughness.\u201d\n\nTrump, having already made America great, now wants to keep it that way\nTrump, in his characteristically elliptical way, announced his 2020 campaign slogan by first explaining why he can\u2019t use the 2016 slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d \u2014 because \u201cI already did that.\u201d It\u2019s now \u201cKeep America Great!\u201d (Which includes the exclamation point.) \n\nTrump exaggerated how many women voted for him \u2014 and he only counts white women\nAt his rally, Trump claimed that a majority of women voted for him in the 2016 election, but that\u2019s not true. \u201cWomen! We love you! We love you. Hey, didn\u2019t we surprise them with women during the election? Remember? \u2018Women won\u2019t like Donald Trump.\u2019 I said, have I really had that kind of a problem? I don\u2019t think so. But, \u2018Women won\u2019t like Donald Trump. It will be a rough night for Donald Trump because the women won\u2019t come out.\u2019 We got 52 percent, right? 52,\u201d he said.\n\nExcept he didn\u2019t get 52 percent of the total women\u2019s vote \u2013 he got 41 percent, the Associated Press pointed out. He got 52 percent of the vote from white women; only 4 percent of black women voted for him, while 25 percent of Hispanic women chose him at the ballot box.\n\nTrump had a bone to pick with NBC and, specifically, Chuck Todd\nTrump, per usual, spent much of his rally assailing the media and \u201cfake news.\u201d But he appeared to be particularly annoyed with NBC News, which he said is \u201cperhaps worse than CNN\u201d \u2014 which is, by the president\u2019s standards, a major insult.\n\nThe President specifically called out NBC News anchor and Meet the Press host Chuck Todd while describing a media appearance that took place nearly 20 years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s 1999, I\u2019m on Meet the Press, a show now headed by sleepy eyes Chuck Todd,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s a sleeping son of a bitch. I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\n\nHe hurled the same \u201dsleepy eyes\u201d insult at Todd on Twitter in April 2017. In September last year, he called former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick a \u201cson of a bitch\u201d as well.\n\nTodd responded in jest on Twitter soon after Trump\u2019s remarks, reminding viewers to set their clocks for Daylight Saving Time \u201cbefore your eyes get too sleepy.\u201d\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t miss @MeetThePress tomorrow! I know folks may be tired in the morning due to springing forward, so set those clocks and DVRs now before your eyes get too sleepy.\n\u2014 Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) March 11, 2018\n\n\n\n\nTrump celebrates women\u2019s history month with attacks on women\nThe president didn\u2019t mince his words when it came to a number of high-profile women he perceives as his enemies. \n\nTrump\u2019s slander of Senator Warren, who is speculated to be a contender in the 2020 presidential election, invoked a typical misogynist trope \u2014 he characterized her as an angry woman. \u201cYou know, I was watching, during the campaign, and Hillary [Clinton] was sitting right there, and Pocahontas was up, she was so angry, you know, I think she\u2019s losing the audience,\u201d Trump said. \n\nTrump also went after Oprah Winfrey, presumably because there\u2019s buzz that the billionaire TV personality might be interested in a presidential bid. \u201cOh, I\u2019d love Oprah to win,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019d love to beat Oprah. I know her weakness.\u201d He said a campaign would be a \u201cpainful experience\u201d for her.\n\nTrump also mocked Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) as \u201cvery low IQ.\u201d He made similar remarks at the annual Gridiron Club dinner in Washington, DC this month.\n\nTrump did have some nice things to say about particular women on Saturday. He took credit for Representative Karen Handel\u2019s (R-GA) victory in the 2017 Georgia special election against Democrat Jon Ossoff, even though Handel kept him at arm\u2019s length during the race. And he complimented his wife Melania for being a \u201cgreat\u201d first lady. \u201cYou think her life is so easy, folks? Not so easy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe other stuff!\n\nTrump, who has been president for more than a year, mocked the idea of acting \u201cpresidential\u201d and how boring it would be. He performed a quick bit as an example, marching around stage and speaking in a low, slow tone. \u201cThat\u2019s much easier than doing what I have to do,\u201d he said. \nThe president called Saccone \u201chandsome\u201d and his opponent \u201cLamb the sham.\u201d \nTrump took credit for the recent Winter Olympics, which he said \u201cwould have been a total failure\u201d without him. \nTrump said CNN is \u201cfake as hell.\u201d \nThe president claimed to have rejected a request from Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto to say Mexico wouldn\u2019t pay for the proposed border wall. \u201cHe said, \u2018Mr. President, I would like you to make a statement that Mexico will not pay for the wall.\u2019 I said, \u2018Are you crazy? I am not making that statement,\u2019\u201d Trump recounted. When they couldn\u2019t agree, Trump said he told Pe\u00f1a Nieto, \u201cBye, bye. There is no way I\u2019m making that deal.\u201d \nHe touted his recently enacted tariffs, saying they\u2019re his \u201cbaby.\u201d \n\nThe 2018 midterms are coming up quickly, and the 2020 presidential campaign will be here before you know it. Saturday was a preview of what\u2019s likely ahead in the coming months as Trump returns to the campaign trail, where he so likes to be.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Sunday sat down for an interview with NBC\u2019s Todd that came just after Trump\u2019s son-of-a-bitch comments. When asked about the president\u2019s remarks about various people, Mnuchin attempted to distance himself and the White House from campaign trail Trump.  \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s using these vulgarities in the context of a campaign rally and obviously there were a lot of funny moments on, on, on that rally,\u201d Mnuchin said.\n\n\u201cYeah, they were hilarious,\u201d Todd shot back.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matthew Yglesias", "body": "No State of the Union response speech has ever been a truly great speech, but Joe Kennedy III delivered what\u2019s probably the best entry in the genre that I\u2019ve ever heard Tuesday night. \nI couldn\u2019t put my finger on exactly what I liked best about it until I read an anonymous Republican snarking about it. \n\n\nA GOP source texts: \"As a Republican I love how at the end of the day, after all their years of crap about identity politics...Democrats picked a white dude from one of the most privileged families in America to do the response.\"\u2014 Jonathan Swan (@jonathanvswan) January 31, 2018\n\n\n\nKennedy\u2019s speech was about how Americans are all in it together and should reject the false choices and inherent elitism of Donald Trump\u2019s divisive politics. \nBecause here\u2019s the thing \u2014 what liberals do in America, at their best, is not identity politics at all. Identity politics is what Donald Trump does. Identity politics is delivering a speech that offers no solutions for any actual problems in people\u2019s lives, interspersed with dog-whistles about MS-13 and standing for the national anthem. \nRepublicans understand the remorseless mathematical logic of having a white guy stand up and deliver a speech about how whiteness is the best and then wrap it up with a bunch of white members of congress lustily chanting \u201cUSA!\u201d \nThe progressive counter, as delivered by Kennedy Tuesday night and by many other orators over the past 250 years or so, is that America is about equality. \n\u201cThis administration isn\u2019t just targeting the laws that protect us,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThey\u2019re targeting the very idea that we are all worthy of protection. For them, dignity isn\u2019t something you\u2019re born with, but something you measure by your net worth, your celebrity, your headlines, your crowd size.\u201d\nThen he slipped into the identity issues, calling out specific reasons Trump might slot you into something other than first class citizenship before wrapping up \u201ctheir record is rebuke to our highest American ideal, the belief that we are all worthy, that we are all equal, that we all count in the eyes of our law and our leaders, our god, and our government. That is the American promise.\u201d\nAbraham Lincoln, writing in 1855 about the anti-immigrant movement of his day, struck a fundamentally similar tone:\nOur progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation, we began by declaring that \u201dall men are created equal.\u201d We now practically read it \u201call men are created equal, except negroes\u201d When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read \u201call men are created equal, except negroes, and foreigners, and Catholics.\u201d When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty -- to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocricy.\nMore recently, Barack Obama launched his political stardom with the argument that \u201cthere\u2019s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there\u2019s the United States of America\u201d and referred to \u201cthe hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a millworker\u2019s son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know that Kennedy will run for president or whether if he did he\u2019d be a good candidate or a good president. But he did give a good speech precisely because he, like Obama and Lincoln before him, refused to be baited by the Donald Trumps of the world into accepting a vision of a segmented America.\nTrump\u2019s game is to pit people against each other and get them so caught up in their internecine status games that they don\u2019t notice the wholesale looting of America that\u2019s taking place under his administration. My general view is that it will, in fact, probably be easier for black and Latino politicians to make this argument than for white Democrats who can sometimes struggle with trying to convey the fundamental unity of American interests without scanting the significance of particular identities. But Kennedy \u2014 who is surely no more unaware of the broad irony of his situation than any of the other various Kennedy politicians across the past three generations \u2014 just went for it, it was a good idea, and it worked.  \nGOP sources are texting snark about it, because the honest truth is they have no idea how to appeal to a diverse electorate.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Emily Stewart", "body": "President Donald Trump is finally weighing in on the Stormy Daniels saga. His lawyers claimed in court papers on Friday that the adult film actress \u2014 who allegedly had an affair with him beginning in 2006 \u2014 has violated a confidentiality agreement at least 20 times, opening her up to damages of $20 million. An attorney for Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, slammed the president\u2019s team for pursuing such an enormous amount from a private citizen over \u201cbogus\u201d damages in a maneuver that is \u201clikely unprecedented in our history.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s lawyers filed two motions on Friday in the United States District Court in California, where Daniels sued to get out of a nondisclosure agreement to stay quiet about her affair with Trump ahead of the election. One of the motions is filed on Trump\u2019s behalf and mentions him directly. \u201cMr. Trump intends to pursue his rights to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d it reads. Until now, Trump has tried to keep his distance from the Daniels saga, instead leaving it to his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to deal with. Cohen has claimed he paid Daniels $130,000 with his own personal money.\n\nBut as the story continues to move closer to Trump\u2019s orbit, Trump himself has had no choice but to get involved. The Wall Street Journal reported that a Trump Organization attorney was listed on confidential arbitration documents that included the restraining order against Daniels. And Daniels is likely to appear on 60 Minutes next Sunday.\n\nTrump will be represented in his case against Daniels by Charles Harder, who is best known for representing Hulk Hogan in the sex tape case that ultimately brought website Gawker down. Harder previously represented Melania Trump in a defamation case against the Daily Mail. \n\nMichael Avenatti, a lawyer representing Daniels, slammed Friday\u2019s filings as a \u201cbullying tactic\u201d from the president and Cohen. He said their attempts to move the case from the state court in Los Angeles where Daniels filed her claim to a federal court is because that would increase the chances the matter be decided in private arbitration, \u201cthus hiding the truth from the public.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe filing today is yet another bullying tactic from the president and Mr. Cohen. They are now attempting to remove this case to federal ct in order to increase their chances that the matter will be decided in private arbitration, thus hiding the truth from the public.\n\u2014 Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) March 17, 2018\n\n\n\n\nHe also said that the president\u2019s decision to sue Daniels for $20 million in \u201cbogus\u201d damages is \u201cremarkable.\u201d He added, \u201cWe are NOT going away and we will NOT be intimidated.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe fact that a sitting president is pursuing over $20M in bogus 'damages' against a private citizen, who is only trying to tell the public what really happened, is remarkable.  Likely unprecedented in our history.  We are NOT going away and we will NOT be intimidated. #basta\n\u2014 Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) March 17, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThat Trump would be willing to sue Daniels is not surprising. USA Today found during the 2016 campaign that Trump and his businesses had been involved in at least 3,500 legal actions in state and federal courts over the course of three decades.\n\nThe drip, drip, drip on Stormy Daniels continues\nThe ongoing saga over Trump\u2019s alleged affair with Daniels and the attempts to keep her from speaking out about it has continued to grow in recent days. Vox\u2019s Jen Kirby on Friday wrapped up the latest in Stormy Daniels news, which beyond the $20 million lawsuit includes the Trump Organization\u2019s ties to efforts to keep Daniels from talking, efforts by BuzzFeed to leverage a separate lawsuit against it to get Daniels to talk, and her tentative impending appearance on 60 Minutes on March 25. Per Kirby: \n\nThis week\u2019s news is more evidence that the Daniels story, first reported in January, won\u2019t die quietly. The latest developments continue to raise serious questions as to whether the $130,000 Daniels (real name Stephanie Clifford) received in hush money just days before the presidential election is an illegal campaign payment. \n\nWhile Trump has weighed in on the matter in court filings, he has not commented on it publicly otherwise. It hasn\u2019t showed up on his Twitter feed \u2014 yet.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "German Lopez", "body": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions just sent out a memo asking federal prosecutors to pursue the death penalty in drug trafficking cases \u2014 implementing President Donald Trump\u2019s plan from earlier this week to ramp up \u201ctough on crime\u201d punishments in response to the opioid epidemic.\n\nHere\u2019s the memo, which in part asks prosecutors to pursue capital punishment in cases \u201cdealing in extremely large quantities of drugs\u201d:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        US Department of Justice\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nSessions can ask federal prosecutors to do this under a law signed by President Bill Clinton in 1994, when fears of crack cocaine and crime led to increasingly punitive criminal justice policies. \n\nThe 1994 provision, however, has never been used to execute drug traffickers. In fact, the federal government has not executed anyone in 15 years.\n\nTrump and Sessions seem intent on changing that. Trump made the case at a rally earlier this month: \u201cIf you shoot one person, they give you life, they give you the death penalty. These [drug traffickers] can kill 2,000, 3,000 people and nothing happens to them.\u201d\n\nThe White House has also asked Congress to reduce the threshold required to impose mandatory minimum sentences for trafficking illicit fentanyl and other opioids \u201cthat are lethal in trace amounts.\u201d\n\nBut the US has tried this increasingly punitive approach over the years \u2014 and it simply has not worked. As Mark Kleiman, a drug policy expert at the Marron Institute at New York University, previously told me, \u201cWe did the experiment. In 1980, we had about 15,000 people behind bars for drug dealing. And now we have about 450,000 people behind bars for drug dealing. And the prices of all major drugs are down dramatically. So if the question is do longer sentences lead to a higher drug price and therefore less drug consumption, the answer is no.\u201d\n\nOne of the best studies backing this is a 2014 review of the research by Peter Reuter at the University of Maryland and Harold Pollack at the University of Chicago. They found that while simply prohibiting drugs to some extent does raise their prices, there\u2019s no good evidence that tougher punishments or harsher supply elimination efforts do a better job of driving down access to drugs and substance misuse than lighter penalties. So increasing the severity of the punishment doesn\u2019t do much, if anything, to slow the flow of drugs.\n\nIn fact, harsher punishments can be counterproductive \u2014 by punishing people who need treatment, not incarceration. Although \u201ctough on crime\u201d efforts are often framed as going after drug dealers and traffickers, the line between who is a dealer or trafficker versus a user can be blurry. A 2017 Bureau of Justice Statistics report, for instance, found that \u201cnearly a third of drug offenders (30 percent of state prisoners and 29 percent of jail inmates) said they committed the offense to get drugs or money for drugs.\u201d\n\nThe failure of the punitive policies is one reason why drug policy experts have emphasized other approaches to resolving the opioid epidemic \u2014 particularly more treatment (including medications like methadone and buprenorphine), more harm reduction (such as better access to the opioid overdose antidote naloxone), fewer painkiller prescriptions (while ensuring the drugs are available to those who really need them), and policies that can help address the root cause of addiction (like mental health issues and socioeconomic despair).\n\nBut Trump\u2019s plan and his speech unveiling it on Monday seem focused on the criminal justice side of things \u2014 the opposite of what experts have recommended. And now his administration is implementing that plan.\n\nFor more on Trump\u2019s opioid epidemic plan, read Vox\u2019s explainer.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Zack Beauchamp", "body": "John Bolton, former ambassador to the United Nations in the Bush administration, is one of the most radically hawkish voices in the American foreign policy conversation. He has said the United States should declare war on both North Korea and Iran. He was credibly accused of both manipulating US intelligence on weapons of mass destruction prior to the Iraq war and abusive treatment of his subordinates. He once \u201cjoked\u201d about knocking 10 stories off the UN building in New York.\n\nAnd now he seems poised to become President Donald Trump\u2019s next national security adviser, which would have significant \u2014 and frightening \u2014 implications for the future of Trump\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nThis rumor has been circulating in earnest since at least last week, when NBC reported that current national security adviser H.R. McMaster, who Trump has never particularly liked, was looking for a way out of the White House. But speculation really escalated on Tuesday afternoon, when Bolton came to the White House and met with the president in the Oval Office. It seemed less like a normal meeting and more like a \u201cjob interview,\u201d as Mieke Eoyang, the vice president for foreign policy at the center-left think tank Third Way, put it in a phone call.\n\nThis interpretation became even more plausible on Tuesday evening, when news broke that one of Trump\u2019s top economic advisers, Gary Cohn, was resigning. Cohn\u2019s departure was widely seen as evidence that Trump\u2019s more moderate advisers \u2014 the people working to restrain his more hardline nationalist impulses \u2014 were losing influence in the White House. McMaster is certainly in that camp, which makes the rumors of his impending departure easier to believe.\n\nSo while we don\u2019t know for sure that Bolton is being actively considered to replace McMaster, there\u2019s at least some evidence to suggest that he is. What would that mean for the Trump administration, and the world?\n\nThe first thing to note is that Bolton would, according to a trio of foreign policy experts from different political affiliations that I spoke to, be a disastrous choice. His track record in government, connections to anti-Muslim groups, and stated views in op-eds and public speeches all suggest that he would push Trump to take extremely dangerous positions on issues like North Korea, Iran, and ISIS.\n\n\u201cI operate on the assumption that John Bolton should be kept as far away from the levers of foreign policy as possible,\u201d says Christopher Preble, the vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. \u201cI think I would rest easy if he was dog catcher in Stone Mountain, Georgia. But maybe not.\u201d\n\nSecond, the fact that Bolton seems to already have Trump\u2019s ear \u2014 you don\u2019t get an Oval Office invite just to chat \u2014 illustrates a fundamental and growing problem with the Trump administration. The president is extremely and fundamentally influenced by the conservative infotainment sphere, most notably Fox News \u2014 where Bolton is an on-air fixture. \n\nBolton, a marginal figure in DC foreign policy circles since his departure from the Bush administration, has managed to become influential again because of his success in the insular world of conservative media and advocacy groups. As a result, American foreign policy may be soon be shaped by someone who seems to truly believe that war is the answer to the world\u2019s most pressing problems.\n\nBolton\u2019s early career shows why he\u2019d be a dangerous national security adviser\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        John Bolton at the 2018 CPAC conference.\n      \n      \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nBolton is, somewhat ironically, a quintessential creature of the Washington swamp.\n\nAfter graduating Yale Law School in 1974, where he had become friends with future Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, he went into private practice in Washington. He made a name for himself working in conservative politics, becoming vice president of the right-wing American Enterprise Institute and serving in mid-level roles in both the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until the George W. Bush administration that Bolton rose to greater prominence. In May 2001, Bush appointed him to be undersecretary of state for arms control, basically the top diplomat focusing on weapons of mass destruction. This position became fairly important in the run-up to the Iraq war, as the Bush administration\u2019s case against Saddam focused on his alleged nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons.\n\nBolton took the hardest of possible lines. He forcefully argued that Iraq had WMD \u2014 \u201cwe are confident that Saddam Hussein has hidden weapons of mass destruction,\u201d as he put in one 2002 speech. After Bush\u2019s 2002 State of the Union speech connecting North Korea, Iraq, and Iran as an \u201cAxis of Evil,\u201d Bolton insisted that this wasn\u2019t just rhetoric \u2014 that there was \u2018\u2019a hard connection between these regimes \u2014 an \u2018axis\u2019 along which flow dangerous weapons and dangerous technology.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe was involved in shaping US intelligence in the run-up to the war \u2014 and not in a good way. In 2002, Bolton\u2019s staff prepared a speech alleging that Cuba had an active biological weapons program. This wasn\u2019t true, and the State Department\u2019s lead bioweapons analyst at the time would not sign off on the claim. Per the analyst\u2019s sworn testimony to Congress, Bolton then called the analyst into his office, screamed at him, and then sent for his boss. In this conversation, per the Washington Post\u2019s David Ignatius, he derisively referred to the analyst as a \u201cmunchkin\u201d and then attempted to get him transferred to a different department.\n\nThis was cruel and unprofessional, but also dangerous. Carl Ford, then the assistant secretary of state for intelligence and research, testified that Bolton\u2019s assault on the analyst had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d throughout the department, freezing out dissent on proliferation issues beyond Cuba. John Prados, a fellow at George Washington University\u2019s National Security Archives, came to an even broader conclusion in a study of declassified Bush administration documents: Bolton bears a significant amount of blame for the politicized intelligence used to justify the decision to attack Iraq.\n\n\u201cAlthough Bolton\u2019s actions did not concern Iraq directly, they came to a high point during the summer of 2002 \u2014 the exact moment when Iraq intelligence issues were on the front burner \u2014 and they aimed at offices which played a central role in producing Iraq intelligence,\u201d Prados writes. \u201cAnalysts working on Iraq intelligence could not be blamed for concluding that their own careers might be in jeopardy if they supplied answers other than what the Bush administration wanted to hear.\u201d\n\nNone of this got Bolton fired. In fact, it got him promoted: In March 2005, President Bush nominated him to be US ambassador to the UN, one of the most important diplomatic positions in the entire government. \n\nBolton\u2019s Senate confirmation hearing turned into a vicious fight, largely over his role in shaping the faulty prewar intelligence about Iraq. But his management style, as exemplified by the munchkin insult, also became a huge issue. When Ford was called to testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he bluntly said Bolton\u2019s personality should disqualify him from holding high office. Ford called him a \u201cbully\u201d who \u201ckisses up and punches down,\u201d among other things.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m as conservative as John Bolton is,\u201d Ford told the committee. \u201cBut the fact is that the collateral damage and the personal hurt that he causes is not worth the price that had to be paid.\u201d\n\nMultiple people who had worked with Bolton came out of the woodwork to speak to these issues. Perhaps the most harrowing such account came in an open letter, written by a former federal contractor named Melody Townsel, recalling a time that she raised issues surrounding the use of funds in a contract Bolton was working on. He didn\u2019t take it well:\n\nMr. Bolton proceeded to chase me through the halls of a Russian hotel \u2014 throwing things at me, shoving threatening letters under my door and, generally, behaving like a madman. For nearly two weeks, while I awaited fresh direction from my company and from US AID, John Bolton hounded me in such an appalling way that I eventually retreated to my hotel room and stayed there. Mr. Bolton, of course, then routinely visited me there to pound on the door and shout threats.\n\nAll in all, according to then-Sen. Joe Biden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time, testimony from at least five people confirmed multiple instances of Bolton behaving abusively towards subordinates and retaliating against intelligence professionals who challenged his policy positions. For these reasons, Bolton could not be confirmed by the Senate \u2014 which was, at the time, controlled by Republicans.\n\nBolton\u2019s Iraq-era activities are extraordinarily relevant for understanding what he might push for as Trump\u2019s national security adviser. \n\nTechnically, his primary job would be running the National Security Council, which exists to coordinate and synthesize the sometimes conflicting policy proposals that emerge from the Pentagon, State Department, and other agencies. He would present the president with strategic assessments of high-level officials like the secretaries of defense and state, offer his own thinking, then communicate Trump\u2019s ultimate decision to the agencies and work to ensure it\u2019s implemented. \n\nPut another way, his job is managing the information that comes to the president and then presenting a clear-eyed and accurate assessment of what\u2019s happening and how to respond to it. Yet Bolton\u2019s history suggests a long and storied history of cherry-picking intelligence to support his preferred hawkish policies. \n\n\u201cI think he would not be someone who would be counseling restraint, or to think about the consequences of their actions,\u201d says Eoyang. \u201cBolton is so much of an ideologue that I don\u2019t think he would accurately portray consequences [of policy options] to the president.\u201d\n\nHis reported history of berating and undermining anyone who attempted to challenge him would further stifle dissent. He\u2019d have more power over the White House national security staff as national security adviser than anyone other than the president, giving him unprecedented ability to act as a \u201cbully,\u201d in Ford\u2019s words. \n\nIt\u2019s very plausible that Bolton would accelerate the brain drain from the federal government that already seems to be taking shape \u2014 not just in the White House, but across the different departments that make foreign policy.\n\n\u201cBolton hates the State Department. He portrays US diplomats as closet Democrats and appeasers,\u201d Richard Gowan, a professor at NYU who has studied Bolton\u2019s career, recalls. \u201cAs NSA, he would almost certainly encourage the hollowing out of State Trump and Tillerson have begun.\u201d\n\nBolton represents the Fox News-ification of foreign policy\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        John Bolton in one of his many public appearances.\n      \n      \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nUltimately, Bolton did get the UN ambassador position \u2014 though without the Senate\u2019s permission. In August 2005, President Bush appointed him to the post while the Senate was out of session (a so-called \u201crecess appointment\u201d). \n\nBolton\u2019s year-and-a-half at the UN was characterized by showy condemnations of the organization, which infuriated American allies, but he had little influence on the UN or the overall arc of Bush\u2019s second-term foreign policy.\n\n\u201cBolton raised hell at the UN, but his actual power was quite limited,\u201d Gowan recalls. \u201cCondi Rice and the mainstream conservatives in the second Bush administration often ignored him. He is quite open about this in his memoirs from that period, which are fun.\u201d\n\nIn December 2006, Bolton called it quits, returning to civilian life. He became a fixture on Fox News and conservative talk radio, where his confirmation fight and anti-UN rhetoric was hailed as a sign of his willingness to speak truth to power. He was so prominent in these spheres, mostly through his contract as a Fox contributor, that he considered running for president in both 2012 and 2016.\n\nBolton was particularly popular among a small but influential group of hardline anti-Islam activists, the \u201ccounter-jihad\u201d movement, who believe the US government was being infiltrated by Islamists and that Islamic law was quietly taking over the US legal system.\n\nBolton wrote the forward to a book by two of the most prominent counter-jihadists, Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer, in 2010. In 2016, Bolton spoke at a conference held by the American Freedom Alliance, considered a \u201chate group\u201d by the Southern Poverty Law Center, titled \u201cCan Islam and the West Coexist?\u201d His speech contained a \u201cjoke\u201d whose punchline was that President Obama was a Muslim.\n\nIn his many media appearances and public appearances, Bolton never wavered from the kind of hawkish policy views he established during the Bush administration. In a 2015 New York Times op-ed, Bolton advocated for a US and/or Israeli airstrike on Iranian nuclear facilities. \u201cTime is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSuch action should be combined with vigorous American support for Iran\u2019s opposition, aimed at regime change in Tehran.\u201d\n\nSince Trump took office, Bolton has put the media savvy and experience with the conservative movement he\u2019s developed to good use \u2014 using various levers to influence the president. In just the first months of 2018, Bolton has appeared on Fox News 19 times, or roughly twice a week on average. He has used those appearances to sell his policy preferences, warning against diplomacy with North Korea and encouraging the Kingdom of Jordan to annex the West Bank (much of which remains under Israeli occupation despite the fact that the vast majority of its citizens are Palestinian).\n\nDuring the early Trump administration, then-White House senior strategist Steve Bannon approached Bolton as part of a plan to get around Cabinet members, like Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, who opposed withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. Bolton drafted a five-page memo detailing his proposal for tearing up the deal, which he then published in the National Review after Bannon departed the White House.\n\nAnd in February 2018, he published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal arguing that the US needed to solve the nuclear stand-off with North Korea by force.\n\n\u201cPre-emption opponents argue that action is not justified because Pyongyang does not constitute an \u2018imminent threat.\u2019 They are wrong,\u201d Bolton wrote. \u201cIt is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current \u201cnecessity\u201d posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons by striking first.\u201d\n\nBolton\u2019s record in the Bush administration and general hawkishness made him a marginal figure in DC foreign policy conversations. So after leaving, he cannily aligned himself with Fox News and other influential groups on the right, like the counter-jihadists, who saw him as an experienced and credible commentator. This led not only to television news and book contracts, but platforms through which he could potentially influence actual Republican elected officials.\n\nThis reached a kind of apogee with President Trump. Trump sees the world through a televisual lens; he seems to get more information from Fox News than from his daily intelligence briefings. The president values the advice of people who he sees on the TV and other friendly media outlets. Bolton is not seen as a relic of the hated Bush administration; he\u2019s seen as an authoritative and expert Fox voice. According to Bolton\u2019s National Review piece, Trump once told him to \u201ccome in and see me any time\u201d in the White House. \n\nTrump\u2019s biggest problem with Bolton seems to be aesthetic. In December 2016, the Washington Post reported that Bolton was eliminated from the running for secretary of state because Trump \u2014 I swear I\u2019m not making this up \u2014 didn\u2019t like his mustache.\n\n\u201cDonald was not going to like that mustache,\u201d one Trump associate told the Post. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone that\u2019s really close to Donald that has a beard that he likes.\u201d\n\nPerhaps because of the mustache, Trump hasn\u2019t taken Bolton\u2019s policy advice to heart. There\u2019s no war with North Korea and the Iran deal remains (largely) intact. But Tuesday\u2019s Oval Office meeting suggests that Bolton\u2019s influence on the president may be growing. If he\u2019s not going to be appointed the next national security adviser, he\u2019s at least got the president\u2019s ear.\n\nAnd Bolton\u2019s ascendancy has a lot of foreign policy analysts concerned.\n\n\u201cIf Bolton becomes the national security advisor, the United States has not hit rock bottom in our international relations,\u201d says Eoyang. \u201cWe could go lower.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Tara Golshan", "body": "President Donald Trump is threatening to shut down the government, tweeting that he is considering vetoing the $1.3 trillion spending bill Congress passed at 1 am Friday because it does not reflect his immigration priorities. A veto would likely cause a government shutdown, as lawmakers have already departed for a two-week recess without passing a short-term spending bill. \n\nTrump tweeted that the bill does not adequately fund the border wall or address the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which he blames Democrats for. Without any action in Congress, the fate of DACA, which the Trump administration pledged to end this year, is currently tied up in courts.\n\n\n\nI am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2018\n\n\n\n\nInsofar that the government funding package largely ignored Trump\u2019s hardline immigration agenda, the president is right to be angry. As Vox\u2019s Dara Lind explained, the bill actually reins in the country\u2019s immigration enforcement apparatus, doesn\u2019t touch so-called \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d and doesn\u2019t come close to fully funding Trump\u2019s southern border well.\n\nAs for DACA, however, Trump should probably direct his frustration at his own party. For months, congressional Republicans have spent all their energy to try to persuade Democrats to separate government spending and immigration. When most Democrats voted to shut down the government over DACA in January, Republicans took to blaming their Democratic colleagues for holding the government \u201chostage\u201d over the \u201cunrelated issue of illegal immigration.\u201d This time, Democrats complied with their demands.\n\nAs Vox reported last week, Trump\u2019s dissatisfaction with the spending bill over immigration was a long time coming. And this isn\u2019t the first time; in May 2017, he was reportedly talked out of vetoing the 2017 spending bill over a lack of border wall funding. It\u2019s clear lawmakers have no interest in a government shutdown fight this time around \u2014 and are tweeting at Trump to back down \u2014 but Trump has repeatedly shown a willingness to go that far.\n\nThe spending bill ignores Trump\u2019s immigration priorities\nPut simply, Republicans didn\u2019t mount a huge fight for Trump\u2019s hardline immigration agenda.\n\nOn enforcement, the GOP went into this week wanting more funding for the Department of Homeland Security to increase the number of beds for immigrant detainees and to expand enforcement, with a call to fund 1,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and 500 more Customs and Border Protection officers. The final compromise included funding for only an additional 328 Customs and Border Protection officers, and ICE will actually have to reduce the number of detention beds. Needless to say, this isn\u2019t the kind of deportation force Trump\u2019s administration was envisioning. \n\nThe bill also does not defund so-called \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d something the White House specifically called on Congress to do.\n\nThe bill also includes only $1.6 billion worth of border wall funding \u2014 much less than the $25 billion the White House asked for. And it comes with a lot of strings attached; most of the funding will have to go toward repairing existing fencing or toward double fencing where barriers already exist. In other words, this isn\u2019t money for Trump\u2019s big, beautiful wall. \n\nTrump\u2019s White House has been frustrated with the spending bill for a while. Trump officials even tried to back-channel conservative ideas with allies in Congress to defund sanctuary cities or push for more border wall spending, but to no avail. Trump reportedly threatened to veto the bill yesterday, but the White House released a statement that the president supported the package. Now it seems his support is wavering yet again.\n\nDemocrats dropped their DACA demands for the omnibus \u2014 but that\u2019s not why DACA isn\u2019t getting addressed\nIn January, Senate Democrats, frustrated with Trump\u2019s unwillingness to accept a bipartisan proposal to address the nearly 700,000 immigrants in legal limbo under DACA, orchestrated a government shutdown with the support of some Republicans. \n\nThe result was a failed and inconclusive Senate floor debate on the issue. Again, Trump\u2019s hard line on negotiations, including a demand to gut the legal immigration system, tanked any possibility for compromise. Both Democrats and Republicans criticized the White House\u2019s plan. Throughout, Republicans have made every effort to separate DACA and spending.\n\nThen last week, the White House made Democrats another offer on DACA: a two-year temporary extension of DACA to protect the roughly 690,000 undocumented immigrants in the program, in exchange for $25 billion in funding for the southern border wall.\n\nDemocrats said no. After a fraught and ultimately fruitless Senate debate on immigration, and with the program tied up in the courts, they have no incentive to accept anything other than a path to citizenship for the 1.8 million unauthorized immigrants currently in the country who came in as children.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that Democrats have changed their tune on tying spending to DACA, the reason there hasn\u2019t been a deal on DACA has a lot to do with Trump himself.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matthew Yglesias", "body": "Political scientist Larry Bartels\u2019s latest paper is a survey of the state of partisanship in the United States in 2018.

It plots how Democrats evaluate various groups on the x-axis and how Republicans evaluate them on the y-axis. It lets you see comparisons such as: Democrats like the Republican Party more than they like Donald Trump (though they dislike both), but Republicans like Trump more than they like the GOP. \n\nBut it also shows that even in these polarized times, lots of things \u2014 especially nurses, working people, and farmers \u2014 are broadly popular on both sides. Mitch McConnell, conversely, is strikingly unpopular.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nThat Democrats dislike McConnell is obviously not surprising. And, indeed, he actually rates a little better among Democrats than Paul Ryan does. But Democrats still really dislike the guy \u2014 rating him below Wall Street bankers or Fox News. And Republicans don\u2019t like him either! They rate him below gays and lesbians, college professors, immigrants, people on food stamps, and environmentalists. Everyone hates him!\n\nThis chart, which plots where rank-and-file voters stand on a two-dimensional conception of ideological space, is also important. Among donors and opinion elites, cross-pressured people tend to be sympathetic to both cultural liberalism and small government \u2014 there\u2019s a reasonably robust set of libertarian institutions built around those ideas. But in the public, it\u2019s the opposite. \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nYou can see there are a lot of people in that upper left quadrant who, regardless of which party they vote for, in practice sympathize with Democratic positions on the size of government and GOP ones on cultural traditionalism.

That\u2019s a change from a January NBC News/WSJ Poll that gave Democrats a six-point edge, 49 percent to 43 percent. And among independents, Democrats have a 12-point lead, with 48 percent of independents saying they prefer a Democratic Congress and 36 percent preferring Republicans. \n\nDemocrats also appear to have an enthusiasm advantage \u2014 60 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of Clinton voters say they have a high degree of interest in the 2018 midterms. Fifty-four percent of Republicans and 37 percent of independents say the same. Young people, however, lag: Only 37 percent of registered voters ages 18-34 say they\u2019re excited about the 2018 vote. \n\nRepublicans have a few reasons to be nervous about the 2018 midterms\nRepublicans dumped millions of dollars to hold Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District in a special election on Tuesday between Democrat Conor Lamb and Republican Rick Saccone. Trump carried the district, which won\u2019t exist in November because the state\u2019s Supreme Court redrew the map to tamp down partisan gerrymandering, by about 20 points in 2016. Lamb still eked out a victory over Saccone.\n\nIt is an ominous sign for the GOP of what might be to come in the November midterms. In a heavily Republican district, backed by $9 million, and with President Donald Trump having campaigned there just days before, the GOP candidate still couldn\u2019t pull out a win. Other recent special elections that in theory shouldn\u2019t have been close have been \u2014 Roy Moore vs. Doug Jones in Alabama, and Jon Ossoff vs. Karen Handel in Georgia, for example.\n\nMoreover, the Pennsylvania special election was the first one where Republicans went all in on their tax cut message, touting the tax bill passed in December that insist will help them win elections in 2018 and beyond. As Vox\u2019s Ella Nilsen and Tara Golshan note, Republicans initially focused on the tax cut messaging in Pennsylvania but by election day had pivoted to decrying so-called sanctuary cities after determining the tax message wasn\u2019t breaking through. (Selling a tax bill that disproportionately benefits the corporations and the wealthy apparently isn\u2019t as easy as anticipated.)\n\nDemocrats have consistently polled better than Republicans on generic Congressional ballots for months. According to RealClearPolitics\u2019 generic ballot polling average, Democrats lead by 7.9 points. In December, RealClearPolitics had them up by about 13 points, but signs point to potentially major gains. Vox\u2019s Andrew Prokop last year laid out how RealClearPolitics\u2019 polling average has played out in actual elections:\n\n\n2002: Republicans +1.7, minor change in Republican-controlled House\n2004: Tied generic ballot, minor change in Republican-controlled House\n2006: Democrats +11.5, wave flips House to Democrats\n2008: Democrats +9, wave further increases Democratic House majority\n2010: Republicans +9.4, wave flips House to Republicans\n2012: Republicans +0.2, minor change in Republican-controlled House\n2014: Republicans +2.4, gains in Republican-controlled House during national GOP wave\n2016: Democrats +0.6, minor change in Republican-controlled House\n\nTrump\u2019s job approval is getting better. It\u2019s still not helping the broader GOP.\nSunday\u2019s NBC News/WSJ poll found that President Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating stands at 43 percent among all Americans, four points higher than where it was in January. FiveThirtyEight\u2019s average of presidential approval polls finds that 40.2 percent of Americans think Trump is doing a good job as president. On January 1, he was at 37.9 percent on average.\n\nIf voters are warming up to Trump slightly (and he still remains historically unpopular compared to his predecessors), that\u2019s not translating to how they feel about Congress. \u201cTrumpism may well help Donald Trump in his 2020 election, but the buck stops there \u2014 which is a flashing red light for Republicans in 2017 or 2018,\u201d Democratic pollster Fred Yang, who conducted the NBC/WSJ poll with GOP pollster Bill McInturff, said in a statement accompanying the results.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "David Roberts", "body": "The New York Times editorial page has come in for a great deal of criticism since it fell under the leadership of James Bennet, previously editor at the Atlantic, in March 2016.\n\nMost recently, new hire Bari Weiss linked to a fake Twitter account as virtually her only evidence in a column devoted to the supposed epidemic of totalitarianism sweeping US universities. (FYI: There is no such epidemic.)\n\nBefore that was the controversy over hiring, and then quickly firing, Quinn Norton, who had Nazi-sympathetic tweets in her past. There was the controversy over hiring Bret Stephens, a climate denier and Woody Allen apologist. There was the controversy over the op-ed/press release by Erik Prince of security contractor Blackwater.\n\nAnd so on. David Uberti at Splinter has a nice rundown of the various fights, along with some trenchant critique. \n\nThe newspaper\u2019s defense, articulated repeatedly by Bennet, news editor Dean Baquet, and onetime ombudsman Liz Spayd, is that the paper is pursuing diversity of opinion, attempting to challenge its readers. \u201cDidn\u2019t we learn from this past election that our goal should be to understand different views?\u201d asked Baquet.\n\nThat defense doesn\u2019t hold up to much scrutiny. As I said in a column on Stephens last year, \u201cit takes a particular sort of insularity to hire a pro-war, anti-Trump white guy as a contribution to diversity on the NYT editorial page.\u201d \n\nIn one of his characteristically scathing columns, Glenn Greenwald notes that the NYT editorial stable currently contains only three women and no Arab-American or Latinx voices; ideologically, it \u201cspans the small gap from establishment centrist Democrats to establishment centrist Republicans.\u201d\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be that hard for the NYT to draw from what lies to the left of those narrow confines. For starters, it could hire a columnist to represent the resurgent left, which rose alongside, but is not dependent on, Bernie Sanders. It stands on its own as a reasonably coherent social critique and policy program, involving greater social provision of basic services, and there are tons of writers who could do it credit.\n\n\nBut representing what lies to the right of those confines is a different and more difficult matter.\n\nThe NYT carries some conservatives, but it does not reflect conservative politics \nThe NYT always had its own, generally liberal editorials, but the opinion page was established in 1970 to provide a venue for a wider range of opinions. \u201cPoints of view in disagreement with the editorial position of The Times,\u201d said publisher Arthur Sulzberger, \u201cwill be particularly welcomed.\u201d And still today, Bennet wrote to Splinter, \u201cwe\u2019re looking to challenge our own and our readers\u2019 assumptions.\u201d\n\nRecently, that concern has taken on a new edge. The traumatic and unexpected 2016 victory of Donald Trump convinced a great many people in elite political circles that they are hopelessly out of touch, there is a whole parallel country of which they are only dimly aware, and they urgently need to understand the perspectives of the people who rallied behind Trump. \n\nThis has led to entire subgenres of news journalism, like \u201crural white people are very upset,\u201d or \u201cTrump supporters still like Trump,\u201d or \u201cget to know this Nazi, he\u2019s just like you and me.\u201d \n\nBut it\u2019s a different dilemma for the opinion page. Bennet clearly believes liberals live in a bubble. He wants to challenge them. It still hasn\u2019t occurred to him to challenge them from the left, so he goes out looking for more conservatives.\n\nBut what kind of conservatives are on offer at NYT? \n\nConsider, oh, David Brooks. His conservatism, of Sam\u2019s Club affectation, fiscal conservatism, tepid social liberalism, and genial trolling of center-leftists at Davos \u2014 who does it speak for in today\u2019s politics, beyond Brooks? \n\nOr Ross Douthat. He is sporadically interesting, often infuriating, but above all, pretty idiosyncratic. His socially conservative \u201creformicon\u201d thing \u2014 who does it speak for in today\u2019s politics, beyond Douthat? \n\nBret Stephens and Bari Weiss are a familiar type of glib contrarian. Their opposition to Trump has given them undue credibility among DC lefties, whom they relentlessly (and boringly) troll. But who are they speaking for? What has the Never Trump movement amounted to? \n\n\nThese writers are, to a (wo)man, alienated from the animating force in US conservatism, which is Trumpism. They command no divisions. They have nothing to do with what is going on in American politics today.\n\nThey might serve the purpose of challenging liberal thinking, but they do not serve the purpose of exposing NYT readers to the people and the movement from which they are allegedly alienated. \n\nIf Bennet wants to do that, he needs to be clear-eyed about what the right is today.\n\nConservatism is now Trumpism\nThe signal feature of the 2016 election is that it settled the question of whether US conservatism \u2014 the actual movement, I mean, not the people in DC think tanks who claim to be its spokespeople \u2014 is animated by a set of shared ideals and policies. It is not.\n\nFor many years, many people have convinced themselves otherwise. A lot of people believe to this day that the Tea Party uprising and the subsequent eight years of hysterical, unremitting, norm-violating opposition to Barack Obama was about small-government philosophy and a devotion to low taxes and less regulation, and had nothing to do with social backlash against a black, cosmopolitan, urban law professor and his diverse, rising coalition. \n\nBut that kind of credulity can only stretch so far, and Donald Trump has stretched it to the snapping point. He abandoned the Very Serious conservative script entirely and the right ate it up. He pledged not to cut Social Security or Medicare, condemned free trade, and insulted the military and intelligence services, and they ate it up. He is a thrice divorced, self-admitted sexual predator indicted on fraud charges and wallowing in the kind of material ostentation that gives David Brooks nightmares, and they ate it up.\n\nBefore Trump, they thought the economy was terrible and Russia was bad. Now they think the economy is great and Russia is good. He\u2019s one of their people, he hates who they hate, and he drives the libs crazy; that\u2019s good enough.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Keith Bedford/The Boston Globe via Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nIn office, Trump has swerved this way and that on immigration, guns, taxes, health care, foreign policy, and trade, changing positions without warning, leaving his staff and supporters to scurry along after him, offering post-hoc justifications. \n\nHe has, admittedly, governed like an orthodox conservative (insofar as he\u2019s gotten any governance done), but that is not from any evident commitment to, or even awareness of, the conservative intellectual tradition. It\u2019s just that he\u2019s weak, vain, easily influenced, and surrounded by conservative ideologues.\n\nThere cannot be an intellectual Trumpism \u2014 a Trumpist philosophy, a Trumpist argument \u2014 because Trump is devoted only to Trump, only to bringing himself glory and defeating his perceived enemies. For now, his interests overlap (mostly) with the interests of the white, suburban and rural conservative base. The only conceivable motivation to support him is tribal; the only argument a tribalist needs to reward himself and punish his enemies is, \u201cWe won.\u201d\n\nThat means anyone who is devoted to the conservative intellectual tradition, anyone who thinks of themselves as a conservative through devotion to small government and traditional morality, has had to peel off. There is no way to pretend that Trump represents that tradition; he himself does not even try.\n\nSo, how many of these \u201ctrue\u201d conservatives did there turn out to be? Almost none! A few intellectuals and writers have jumped ship (David Frum, Bill Kristol, George Will), but the Wall Street Journal, Fox, Breitbart, and the rest have happily adapted to acting as state media. For all intents and purposes, Trump commands the support and loyalty of the GOP coalition. \n\nThe ragged band devoted to the principles of conservative governing philosophy is in exile, with no home. It was, it turns out, almost entirely epiphenomenal to the movement; its roots were an inch deep. \n\nEven the conservative lawmakers alleged to be horrified by Trump, leaking anonymously to reporters about how terrible he is, scarcely ever stand up to him, for the simple reason that he\u2019s enormously popular with the base.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        No, I will never stop using this GIF.\n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nTrumpist conservatism is not motivated by ideas, but resentments\nSo what motivates this swell of right-wing support for Trump? At this point, though many people on all sides still refuse to acknowledge it, the evidence is overwhelming: It was cultural backlash, against immigrants, minorities, uppity women, liberals, and all the other forces seen as dislodging traditional white men from their centrality in American culture. \n\nI recommend browsing through this thread, which rounds up more than a dozen studies, papers, and surveys:\n\n\nThey all point in the same direction: Race and gender had unusually high salience in the 2016 election, and what distinguished Trump supporters most of all, more than income or education, was racism and misogyny, i.e., feelings of hostility toward minorities and women. \n\nWhat Trump revealed, in the most dramatic way possible, is that the conservative base in the US today is driven not by ideology but by white resentment. That\u2019s the underlying thread. Trump may lurch back and forth on policy \u2014 or more often, demonstrate an almost cosmic ignorance of policy \u2014 but he speaks to, and in the voice of, America\u2019s angry whites, who want their imagined old America back. He is the prototypical Fox News viewer, tossing off endless insults, conspiracy theories, and furious aggrievement. \n\nWhat\u2019s happening in the US today is not a contest of governing philosophies. Trump doesn\u2019t have one and his administration barely tries to pretend it does. It\u2019s not a philosophy or a plan that won, it was a team, a tribe. They are living it up, rewarding their friends and ratfucking everything the other team did before them. \n\nMore broadly, what\u2019s going on in American politics is a contest between those who believe that America is an idea and those who believe America is a people, a particular culture \u2014 white, Christian, and patriarchal. Trump represents those who want that culture restored to primacy.\n\nHow can the NYT opinion page expose its readers to that?\n\nThe NYT cannot host true conservatism because true conservatism does not share its standards\nAs I said, the conservatives who care about conservatism as an intellectual tradition and a governing philosophy have mostly jumped ship. If the NYT wants to find authentic expressions of the sentiments animating Trump supporters, it will have to look beyond the confines of the elite establishment, to Breitbart, TownHall, InfoWars, or one of avowedly right-wing outlets where conservatives cluster. \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        CJR\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nIt will have to recruit Sean Hannity or Tomi Lahren or Mark Steyn someone who thinks of liberals as godless traitors and accepts ludicrous conspiracy theories about Democratic staffer Seth Rich being assassinated or Hillary Clinton colluding with Russia to defeat Donald Trump or Democrats running a child prostitution ring out of a pizza restaurant. It will have to recruit Ben Shapiro to run serial variations on \u201crap is crap\u201d or \u201cwhites are the real victims of racism.\u201d\n\nIt will have to recruit popular conservative columnist Kurt Schlichter, who mused this week that because \u201cthe central tenet of the Democrat Party platform is now hatred and contempt for Normal Americans,\u201d there is probably going to be a second Civil War, which conservatives will win, because they have more guns and liberals are easy to kill. (There\u2019s a long section speculating on how a right-wing militia could invade San Francisco, which is \u201ca hotbed of treason.\u201d)\n\n\nThe people who support Trump have been embedded in a hermetically sealed right-wing media bubble for so long that they only know liberals as horrific caricatures and only experience politics as a war to save white Christian culture from its sworn enemies. They are exposed to endless lies and conspiracy theories designed to keep them in a frenzy, convinced that Antifa is around the corner and Sharia Law is imminent. \n\nIf the NYT wanted to expose its readers to the motive force of contemporary conservatism, that\u2019s the kind of stuff it would run.\n\nBut let\u2019s be real, James Bennet is not going to run that stuff in the NYT. It can sometimes be difficult to tell, but the NYT does have standards of accuracy, even on the opinion page, and most of that stuff I mentioned contains falsehoods. (The Democrats are not running a child prostitution ring.) \n\nThe NYT expects a certain civility, and Breitbart types are incapable of discussing opponents as human beings. The NYT has decided, like most mainstream US institutions, that overt racism and misogyny are unacceptable \u2014 not part of the diversity of viewpoints it seeks to represent. But without them, the picture is incomplete.\n\nMost importantly, the NYT sees the opinion page as a contest of ideas. And fundamentally, what Trumpist conservatives are advocating for are not ideas, but a demographic, a tribe. \n\nIt\u2019s a tribe that has split off from mainstream institutions, rejects mainstream standards of accuracy, and now uses media entirely as a tool, a weapon. Its goal is to defeat the libs; what\u2019s good is anything libs hate.\n\nThe most popular voices of the right-wing base are simply not engaged in the same undertaking as the NYT. That makes hosting them on the opinion page rather fraught.\n\nIt\u2019s true that NYT readers have been insulated from contemporary conservatism\nHere is the scary truth that NYT editors and readers alike resist: US politics today is not a contest of ideas or governing philosophies. We are witnessing a massive revanchist upheaval \u2014 against bourgeois morality and standards of conduct, against changing demographics and economies, against assumptions about governance and respect for norms, against the status quo \u2014 by a culture that is stagnating even as the country changes around it, which it experiences as a loss of dignity and prestige.\n\nNot everyone involved is driven by tribal resentment, not every Trump voter indulges in misogyny or racism, but every member of the current conservative coalition has decided that those things are acceptable, or at the very least, not disqualifying \u2014 less important than lower taxes or immigration crackdowns. \n\nEven if they do not share Trump\u2019s ignorant, hateful impulses, even if they do not endorse his careening, incompetent governance, even if they do not countenance the grotesque corruption of his family and his administration, they support the coalition that enables those things. They are supporting a tribe with a strongman leader, not a set of ideas.\n\n\nThere\u2019s no argument for that, nothing to plausibly fill an editorial page. As I said, the tribalist\u2019s only argument is, \u201cWe won.\u201d The only idea is: to the victors the spoils.\n\nWhen the NYT opinion page pretends that conservatism is David Brooks or Bret Stephens when it maintains the comforting illusion that American politics is a contest of ideas, it is not exposing its readers to uncomfortable truths \u2014 it is sheltering them. \n\nDo NYT readers \u2014 who mostly read mainstream sources, mostly live in cities, mostly are not exposed to right-wing media \u2014 understand that the most active voices on the American right today are filled with paranoid rage, hopped up on lies and conspiracy theories, unmoved by reason, and devoted to their total destruction? Do they understand that the values and norms they assume safe and sacrosanct are in fact under heavy siege? Do they know that American democracy is in danger of coming apart?\n\nI\u2019m not sure they do; I think they still imagine Republican moderates gathered in a cave somewhere, ready to swoop in and take charge again at the sight of the David Brooks bat signal. \n\nIf the NYT wants to challenge their assumptions, it should challenge those.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matthew Yglesias", "body": "When Donald Trump fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on a trumped-up pretext and then sent a series of tweets lambasting special counsel Robert Mueller and his team in dishonest terms, it sparked a new spasm of concern about the future of Mueller\u2019s investigation. \n\nPeople are right to worry about this. In particular, congressional Republicans ought to worry about it a lot more than they currently are, since sacking Mueller on impulse before the midterms would likely make it harder for them to maintain their majorities. \n\nBut the Mueller-centric focus obscures a much broader problem. Trump\u2019s decision sends a message down the ranks to typical Justice Department attorneys to be wary about taking on Trump or his associates. \n\n Trump has a lot of fingers in a lot of pies. So do his various family members and the B-list rich guys who round out his Cabinet. So do the wealthy individuals who are donating to his increasingly aggressive fundraising efforts. This creates a lot of potential points of intersection between Trump and his associates and the law \u2014 points of intersection that won\u2019t necessarily involve anything as thrilling as Russian espionage, that certainly won\u2019t be investigated by anyone as august as Mueller and his prosecutorial all-star team, and that aren\u2019t being followed intensely by the news media.\n\nThis \u2014 in the halls of normal US attorneys\u2019 offices and regulatory agencies \u2014 is where the real chilling effect of Trump\u2019s war on the rule of law is likely to be felt. And an all-hands-on-deck drive to secure Mueller\u2019s position risks simply affirming to officials tasked with enforcing the law in more banal ways that nobody is out there prepared to protect them. \n\nThe special counsel is special\nConsider that Mueller\u2019s situation is genuinely special. \n\nWere he to be fired, it would be a huge national story with obvious political consequences.  What\u2019s more, there\u2019s no good alternative to firing Mueller. You can\u2019t quietly transfer him to the Alaska office or make his life miserable with tedious paperwork. He\u2019ll investigate Trump right up until the day he is fired. \n\nAnd if he does get fired, he and his team will have a big story to tell the press and an eager audience for it. The question will then become whether the voters care about a Trump action that amounts to an implicit admission of guilt.\n\nMost important of all, neither Mueller nor the other senior members of his team have anything to lose personally in this. Mueller is an affluent retired former FBI director who took this gig because he wanted to investigate Trump. His team is composed of well-known, very successful litigators and investigators who wanted to be part of the investigation of the century. Obviously, none of them want to see the investigation shut down. But they have no reason to fear for their welfare or livelihood if it is, so they\u2019re not going to pull any punches. \n\nThe real problem is that almost nobody else in the federal government enjoys that kind of freedom. \n\nProsecutors need to be able to investigate the president\u2019s allies\nUS attorneys are appointed by the president of the United States, and obviously, some political consideration goes into their selection. But generally speaking, federal prosecutors do their work in a professional and nonpartisan manner. Early in Barack Obama\u2019s term of office, federal investigators in Illinois charged Gov. Rod Blagojevich in a manner that was not only inconvenient to national Democrats but arguably cost them a blue Senate seat from 2011 to 2016. Later in Obama\u2019s term, a federal case against Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ) wound up nearly costing Democrats a different blue Senate seat.\n\nAnd there was nothing particularly unusual about this. One doesn\u2019t even exactly need to believe that Obama or his predecessors were too pure of heart to interfere with federal investigations for partisan reasons \u2014 they were simply cautious. \n\nTo be seen as meddling in a federal investigation in that way would have been a huge scandal had it been uncovered, and traditionally, presidents have tried to avoid generating huge scandals. \n\nBut Trump, by firing McCabe and Comey on thin pretexts and then more or less immediately admitting that the pretexts were not the real reason, sends a powerful message: He doesn\u2019t care. Everyone working in every federal agency in America knows that fear of being caught isn\u2019t going to stop Trump from engaging in political meddling. If you look into malfeasance committed by a business he owns \u2014 or that his son-in-law owns, or one of his friends or donors or other associates \u2014 and he gets mad about it, he might stomp on you and not worry too much about the possibility of getting caught. And the mere fact that this is so obvious means the stomping doesn\u2019t actually need to come from the West Wing at all.\n\nWorking toward the Donald\nPart of the normal scandal aversion of a normal administration is that middle managers in the federal bureaucracy who sincerely support the president will try not to create a scandal. So it\u2019s not just that Obama would not personally reach down into an investigation and meddle for political purposes, but a passionate Obama fan who also happens to run an Environmental Protection Agency field office wouldn\u2019t do it either. The top leadership sets a tone, and while the tone isn\u2019t universally followed, it does exert a big influence on people\u2019s practical behavior. \n\nTrump, by contrast, has sent a clear signal in the opposite direction \u2014 he wants federal public servants, up to and including FBI special agents, to act like they are his personal employees. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll all do it \u2014 most of them won\u2019t. But some of them will. The actual political appointees at every agency know what\u2019s expected of them, and to the extent that there are ambitious and career-minded Trump fans scattered throughout the government \u2014 which is surely the case at the federal police agencies, if not the regulatory ones \u2014 they know that excessive service of Trump\u2019s personal interests will be rewarded rather than punished. And folks who are merely career-minded will know that what\u2019s good for them is to keep their heads down and just try to ride this out. \n\nAnd these rank-and-file employees, critically, aren\u2019t Robert Mueller. They have non-glamorous jobs that they may actually need to pay the rent and feed their families. They can be retaliated against in more subtle ways than a firing, and the news media won\u2019t necessarily care about them or their stories. \n\nMueller mania lets Republicans off the hook\nNone of this is to deny the unique significance of Mueller and his investigation. But the narrow focus on preserving the integrity of that particular inquiry ends up setting the bar for Trump and the GOP too low. Ever since McCabe was fired, Republicans on Capitol Hill are mostly staying quiet, but a few, like Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have spoken up to caution Trump not to fire Mueller. \n\n\n\nLindsey Graham reiterates this to Trump when asked by @jaketapper about the potential firing of Mueller. \u201cIf he tried to do that, that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency. We are a rule-of-laws nation. \u201c\n\u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) March 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s good as far as it goes. But it simply doesn\u2019t go very far. \n\nNobody on the GOP side \u2014 not Graham, not John McCain, not Jeff Flake, and certainly nobody on the House side of things \u2014 has indicated any commitment to insisting that Trump uphold the rule of law overall or a general defense of the integrity and independence of federal law enforcement. \n\nAnd yet it\u2019s precisely here that the danger is greatest, of enforcement either being used selectively to punish Trump\u2019s enemies or being ignored selectively to reward his friends. Normal leaders tread cautiously in this domain for fear of exposure, scandal, and political backlash. But Trump tends to operate on the principle that audacity will be rewarded and new scandals will always come along to crowd out old ones.

Clearly, money didn\u2019t get them very far.\n\nThe history and demographics of Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District, which covers the southwest corner of the state, should have made for an easy race for Saccone; the region is older and very white (total minority population is less than 5 percent), and was rated as an R+11 district \u2014 a heavy Republican tilt in part due to Pennsylvania\u2019s partisan gerrymandering that the state Supreme Court recently ruled unconstitutional. \n\nInstead, Tuesday night was a wakeup call for Republicans, who were test-driving their messaging strategy for the 2018 midterms \u2014 and just watched it crash into a Democratic wave.\n\nSaccone was an expensive bet\nAfter Saccone\u2019s campaign showed a lackluster fundraising effort, outside Republican groups \u2014 including the national campaign arm for House Republicans \u2014 jumped in to get Saccone over the finish line.\n\nRepublican-aligned groups have greatly outspent Democrats in the race. According to the Washington Post, as of February 27, Saccone\u2019s campaign and allied groups had spent a total of $9.1 million on the race, between the Congressional Leadership Fund, the National Republican Congressional Committee, and others.

For weeks, the bill was the subject of countless ads and consumed Saccone\u2019s talking points. Trump even visited the state for a conveniently located GOP tax rally in Western Pennsylvania in January, which the White House insisted was not directly related to Saccone\u2019s candidacy.\n\nAt the beginning of February, almost two-thirds of GOP ads were about the Republican tax law, according to a Politico analysis \u2014 but it didn\u2019t stick.

(And in fact, SCL hired the company that made that Goldeneye film set to put together a similar ops center.) \n\nWhat those fancy facilities were actually used for, though, was far less clear. The Independent wrote that \u201cits primary function appears to have been cosmetic,\u201d and quoted an Indonesian source calling it \u201cjust like a movie set to impress the clients.\u201d\n\nSome of SCL\u2019s operations ended badly \u2014 the Indonesian president the firm worked for was deposed, and the Thai contract concluded with a falling out and local reports that Oakes had violated the country\u2019s immigration laws. Nevertheless, Oakes and SCL proved remarkably adept at convincing new clients to write them big checks. \n\nAfter 9/11, the firm began to tout its alleged expertise at anti-terrorism and anti-jihadi messaging at a time when Western governments were eager to pay for such work.  (\u201cPsych-ops was big business and people were just chucking money around,\u201d a source told the Observer.) \n\nAnd finally, in 2013, SCL found a wealthy American who\u2019d give them a great deal of money indeed.\n\nSteve Bannon and the Mercer family worked with the Brits to found Cambridge Analytica \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Steve Bannon.\n      \n      \n        Sylvain Lefevre/Getty\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nAround 2013, word of SCL\u2019s work reached the ears of Steve Bannon \u2014 and he was intrigued. Bannon was then running Breitbart News, but perhaps more importantly, he was a trusted political adviser to Robert and Rebekah Mercer, the father-daughter pair of conservative mega-donors. Bannon connected SCL with the Mercers, and the British firm pitched a major  expansion of its operation into US politics. \n\nSCL claimed to be able to do a new type of political targeting that would be based on modeling individuals\u2019 personalities (rather than just demographic traits like age, race, or gender, as is traditional). They\u2019d do so based on survey questions that measure the Big Five or \u201cOCEAN\u201d personality traits commonly used in psychology research \u2014 Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. (You can take the test here.) \n\nThey\u2019d also use modeling to extrapolate the personalities of people they didn\u2019t directly survey. Then, SCL claimed, they could tailor messaging to better target and persuade voters based on their particular personalities. This, they said, was the future of politics.\n\nThe Mercers agreed to provide $15 million for this project. To do so, they set up a new company mostly owned by Robert Mercer, with SCL Group executive Alexander Nix as the CEO. It would be named Cambridge Analytica (a name reportedly provided by Bannon, who would also have a stake in the company and serve as a vice president). But according to the New York Times, Cambridge was \u201ceffectively a shell,\u201d and all its contract work would be carried out by the SCL Group.\n\nAt the core of this new effort would be a vast amount of data that an outside researcher harvested from tens of millions of people\u2019s Facebook profiles \u2014 an effort Cambridge Analytica reportedly funded to the tune of $7 million. The data was matched with other records to construct personality profiles on millions of American voters, in hopes that Cambridge could better target them with customized political messaging.\n\nIn GOP political consulting circles, Cambridge soon gained a reputation as the Mercers\u2019 somewhat odd pet project. The wealthy hedge fund family would reportedly demand candidates hire Cambridge if they wanted Mercer money. And after working on various low-profile GOP political efforts in 2014, Cambridge landed a major job with a Mercer-funded Super PAC supporting Ted Cruz\u2019s presidential candidacy. But the gig went poorly \u2014 the Cruz team claimed Cambridge\u2019s data was worthless and fought with them over money, according to a later New York Times report.\n\nCambridge beefed up Donald Trump\u2019s digital operation for the 2016 general election\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Trump on the campaign trail in October 2016.\n      \n      \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nEventually, Donald Trump emerged as the GOP nominee-in-waiting. And though Bannon was still a few months away from officially joining the Trump campaign, he made the introduction between Cambridge and Trump\u2019s team. (Bannon owned a stake in Cambridge and was being paid by it at the time.) Various reports name Trump staffers Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner, and Brad Parscale as involved in the decision to bring Cambridge on board, and on June 23, 2016, the campaign signed a contract with the firm.\n\nTrump\u2019s digital team was run by Brad Parscale out of an office in San Antonio, Texas, and Cambridge sent along 13 people to work with them there, Wired reported. \n\nWhat did they do? Well, in the new Channel 4 News report, Cambridge CEO Alexander Nix brags to someone he thought was a prospective client that \u201cwe did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign, and our data informed all the strategy\u201d (though he could be inflating the company\u2019s role).\n\nHowever, one thing that both Trump aides and Cambridge staffers have since claimed the company did not do for Trump is use the firm\u2019s fancy, futuristic-sounding \u201cpsychographic\u201d personality modeling. People from both camps have said, in public statements and to reporters, that the Trump campaign chose to use the RNC\u2019s data file as its raw data, not those tens of millions of personal profiles matched with Facebook data that Cambridge obtained.\n\nIf this is true, Cambridge\u2019s work for Trump resembled less sexy, more traditional political consulting. More specifically:\n\n\nCambridge oversaw a $5 million placement of TV ads \u2014 though the Times reports that the Trump campaign was unhappy with the results, since Cambridge ended up paying for ads on cable channels in Washington, DC.\nThe firm worked on targeting digital ads and online fundraising.\nThey did polling of swing states.\n\nIn the end, FEC filings show that the Trump campaign paid Cambridge $5.9 million over the rest of the campaign, and the Wall Street Journal reported that $3 million more went to Cambridge through Brad Parscale\u2019s firm.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump\u2019s digital operation was generally thought to be a joke, and Clinton\u2019s team was portrayed as the ingenious data wizards with incredible algorithms. But after Clinton\u2019s shocking loss, people naturally searched for explanations \u2014 and Cambridge Analytica was willing and eager to take credit. Not everyone bought it, though \u2014 the Spectator\u2019s Paul Wood asked \u201cAre Cambridge Analytica brilliant scientists or snake-oil salesmen?\u201d in December 2016.\n\nCambridge got its Facebook data through questionable means\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n      \n      \n        Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nOf late, though, Cambridge has faced a new round of scrutiny over just how it got all that Facebook data in the first place \u2014 and Facebook, too, is facing major questions about what happened.\n\nThe Guardian actually first broke much of this story all the way back in December 2015, when Cambridge was still backing Ted Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign. But last week, a former Cambridge employee, Christopher Wylie, provided documents and first-person testimony in both a Times story (by Matthew Rosenberg, Nick Confessore, and Carole Cadwalladr) and an Observer story (by Cadwalladr) laying out, in far more detail, exactly what happened.\n\n\nAleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic at Cambridge University, got permission from Facebook to pull data via an app he created \u2014 but he reportedly claimed he\u2019d use this data only for academic purposes, not commercial ones.\nKogan\u2019s app, \u201cthisismydigitallife,\u201d was a personality quiz Facebook users could take. However, to take the quiz, users had to consent to give the app access to their and their friends\u2019 Facebook profiles. \nMore than 270,000 people used the app and took the quiz. However, because they consented to give the app access to their friends\u2019 profiles, too, Kogan ended up collecting data from far more \u2014 50 million raw profiles, of which about 30 million could be matched with other records that helped identify people.\nCambridge Analytica was the brains behind Kogan\u2019s operation and ended up spending about $7 million on this data, Wylie told the Observer. (It also seems that Bannon gave the new company its name because of all this, since Kogan worked at Cambridge University.)\nFacebook says it learned that Kogan had violated their rules by passing on the information to third parties in 2015 and that it subsequently got assurances from Kogan and Cambridge that they deleted the data they\u2019d collected. However, a former Cambridge employee told the Times that \u201che had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes\u201d of that data still on the company\u2019s servers.\n\nBoth Facebook and Cambridge have faced enormous criticism for all this, and as the news was about to break, Facebook announced it would suspend Cambridge, SCL Group, Kogan, and Wylie from its platform. \n\nHowever, despite Wylie\u2019s dramatic claims that he and Cambridge \u201cbroke Facebook,\u201d the harvesting of such data, even from users\u2019 friends who didn\u2019t clearly consent, does seem to have been clearly allowed by Facebook at the time, and many app developers had similar practices. Indeed, Zeynep Tufekci argues that this is an \u201call-too-natural consequence of Facebook\u2019s business model,\u201d since the company makes money \u201cby profiling us and then selling our attention to advertisers, political actors and others.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether any laws were broken here \u2014 Andrew Keane Woods runs down some possibilities at Lawfare \u2014 but regulators in the US and the UK both say they\u2019re looking into the matter. \n\nImportantly, it hasn\u2019t been shown Cambridge used this Facebook profile info in its work for the Trump campaign. (Wylie left the firm in late 2014, so he can\u2019t speak to that.)\n\nAlso, apropos of nothing, Aleksandr Kogan at one point changed his name to \u201cDr. Spectre,\u201d but then changed it back.\n\nCambridge\u2019s CEO bragged about doing shady stuff to someone he thought was a potential client\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        A screencap of the Channel 4 News report in which CEO Alexander Nix is surreptitiously taped bragging about \u201cdirty tricks\u201d tactics.\n      \n      \n        Channel 4 News\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nShortly after Wylie came forward publicly, Channel 4 News in the UK began to publish a series that was the result of a four-month investigation it conducted into Cambridge Analytica.\n\nChannel 4 got a reporter to pose as a wealthy Sri Lankan interested in influencing politics in his home country \u2014 and secretly taped Cambridge executives, including eventually CEO Alexander Nix, as they pitched their services to him in a series of meetings.\n\nIt was Nix, hoping to close the deal, who said the most attention-getting things. He said the company operates \u201cin the shadows\u201d and that he looks forward \u201cto building a very long-term and secretive relationship with you.\u201d He said that his company could have an operative try to videotape a politician they want to discredit accepting a bribe. \u201cThey will offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance,\u201d Nix said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras.\u201d\n\nAnother possibility, Nix continued, was to \u201csend some girls around to the candidate\u2019s house \u2014 we have lots of history of things.\u201d He elaborated, \u201cWe could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us,\u201d since they\u2019re \u201cvery beautiful.\u201d However, he did go on to say, \u201cPlease don\u2019t pay too much attention to what I\u2019m saying because I\u2019m just giving you examples of what can be done and what, what has been done.\u201d Nix also told the supposed prospective client that he uses an email service called ProtonMail and sets it to delete all his mail two hours after it\u2019s read, so there will be no \u201cpaper trail.\u201d\n\nAs the Atlantic\u2019s David Graham notes, dirty tricks like these don\u2019t really have anything to do with big data or psychographic personality profiling. They make Cambridge sound rather more like an ordinary political consulting firm from the shadier side of the business. In any case, Nix\u2019s comments to Channel 4 have created enough of an uproar that Cambridge said Tuesday it\u2019s suspending him pending an investigation. (What that means for Nix\u2019s position at SCL Group is not yet clear.)\n\nCambridge Analytica\u2019s CEO also reached out to Julian Assange in search of hacked Democratic emails\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, in May 2017.\n      \n      \n        Jack Taylor/Getty\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nYet the new reports aren\u2019t the only reason Cambridge is under scrutiny. One of the central focuses of special counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation is whether anyone on Trump\u2019s team had inside knowledge about or played any role in the hacking and leaking of prominent Democrats\u2019 emails in 2016.\n\nAnd we learned last year, via reporting from the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Rebecca Ballhaus, that Nix \u2014 Cambridge\u2019s CEO \u2014 had contacted Julian Assange of WikiLeaks about just that topic, both just before and after Cambridge signed on with the Trump campaign.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence yet that Nix\u2019s contacts with Assange actually led to anything. But here\u2019s the timeline of what we know happened:\n\n\nIn mid-May 2016, Cambridge began discussions with Trump\u2019s team about work for the campaign.\nOn June 12, 2016, WikiLeaks\u2019s Julian Assange publicly claimed to have \u201cupcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton,\u201d which he specified were \u201cemails.\u201d\nNix says that it was after he saw this report, in \u201cearly June,\u201d that he reached out to Assange to ask if he could get an advance look at those emails. He says that Assange turned him down.\nAt some point that same month, Cambridge board member Rebekah Mercer talked with an associate about whether they should try to somehow obtain Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails, a source told Ballhaus. (Clinton deleted about 33,000 emails, about half of the total on her server, rather than turn them over to the government because she said they were personal rather than work-related.) Ballhaus\u2019s source claimed Mercer decided not to go through with this.\nOn June 13, 2016, Cambridge sent a proposed contract to Trump\u2019s team.\nOn July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks began posting hacked DNC emails.\nOn June 23, 2016, the Trump campaign signed a contract with Cambridge to do digital work.\nIn August 2016, Nix emailed Mercer and other Cambridge employees and said that he\u2019d recently reached out to Assange again, and offered to help better organize the WikiLeaks-posted DNC emails, but hadn\u2019t yet heard back.\n\nBoth Nix and Assange have said, however, that these overtures never went anywhere. No evidence has emerged to disprove them. Still, this is yet another addition to the list of Trump associates who betrayed at least some interest in getting involved in the email hackings (and we should keep in mind that the email hackings themselves were a crime).\n\nThere have been also questions about whether Trump\u2019s data operation worked with Russia\nFinally, separately from Nix\u2019s contacts with Assange, there have been questions for months about whether the Trump campaign\u2019s data operation collaborated with Russian digital efforts to boost Trump or hurt Clinton in some way.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in December that Mueller had requested Cambridge turn over the emails of any of its employees who worked on Trump\u2019s campaign. And anonymously sourced reports from McClatchy and Vanity Fair, among others, have said Mueller\u2019s team is looking into whether Trump\u2019s digital operation provided information to Russians to help them determine which American voters to target with their own digital efforts. \n\nAs of now, there is no evidence that this occurred, and Mueller\u2019s recent indictment of several Russian individuals and companies for conspiring to interfere with the election through their propaganda work makes no allegations that anyone on Trump\u2019s team was aware of their activities.\n\nBut since Cambridge was a major part of Trump\u2019s digital operation, there are some questions about them and their own ties to Russia.\n\n\n The firm has also claimed to have done work in Russia and Ukraine in the past. \nAleksandr Kogan, who provided that Facebook data, is also an associate professor at St. Petersburg University and got a grant from the Russian government to research social networks. \nCambridge at one point tried to land business from the Russian oil and gas company Lukoil.\nDays after WikiLeaks began posting the DNC emails and at the height of the 2016 campaign, Nix was photographed on a polo field with the Russian ambassador to the United Kingdom, according to Mother Jones.\n\nAnother odd note is that, toward the end of the campaign, Trump foreign policy adviser Michael Flynn signed on to do consulting for the SCL Group. It is not clear what, if anything, Flynn did for them. However, and perhaps unrelatedly, some reports have suggested that Flynn was involved in yet another apparent effort to obtain Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails from Russian hackers in 2016, undertaken by Peter Smith, a Republican consultant unconnected to the Trump campaign. (Flynn has since become a cooperating witness for Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.)\n\nMeanwhile, many politicos think Cambridge is full of hot air\nLast but not least, another angle to all this is that as unsettling as Cambridge\u2019s own claims about its futuristic capabilities may sound \u2014 \u201cI made Steve Bannon\u2019s psychological warfare tool,\u201d the Observer\u2019s headline thundered, quoting Christopher Wylie \u2014 many Republican political professionals who\u2019ve worked with the firm have generally derided the quality of its work.\n\nTake these tweets from three well-connected political reporters:\n\n\n\nBIGGEST SECRET ABOUT CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA: It was ( is) an overpriced service that delivered little value to the TRUMP campaign,  the other campaigns  PACs that retained it \u2014 most of which hired the firm because it was seen as a prerequisite for receiving $$$ from the MERCERS.\n\u2014 Kenneth P.

Complaints about Cambridge were legion during the 2016 campaign and spilled into the press in real time. Even those years-old articles about the SCL Group I mentioned above heavily hint that the firm may be vastly overselling its talents.\n\nBut whether Cambridge has really discovered some powerful new digital techniques, or whether they\u2019re relatively ordinary political consultants with a penchant for hyperbolic rhetoric, the firm is now under more scrutiny than ever \u2014 and its future looks increasingly cloudy.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Tara Golshan", "body": "The Pennsylvania special election should be a wake-up call for Republicans, but all House Speaker Paul Ryan has is some excuses.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Republican House candidate Rick Saccone failed to secure a win in a special election for a Pennsylvania district that went for President Donald Trump by 20 points. The race stretched into Wednesday afternoon, when Democrat Conor Lamb, the 33-year-old former Marine, officially won the race in a stunning upset. Pennsylvania law does not mandate a recount in district-level elections. \n\nYet Ryan said he wasn\u2019t surprised by the results. Lamb ran as a \u201cconservative,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe candidate who is going to win this race is the candidate who ran as a pro-life, pro-gun, anti-Nancy Pelosi, conservative,\u201d Ryan said at his weekly press conference in the Capitol.\n\nIt\u2019s one of a long list of justifications Republicans have rattled off to explain Saccone\u2019s performance: from deriding Saccone\u2019s electability to saying the Pennsylvania 18th District was a Democratic district in the first place (it\u2019s not), or that eventually voters would see the benefits of their economic policy.\n\nPennsylvania uncovered an uncomfortable reality for Republicans, who tried to push tax cuts in this race, with outside groups spending more than $7 million largely on that message. Lamb, as moderate as he was, didn\u2019t try to mirror Republicans on their agenda.\n\nI tried to ask Ryan about this Wednesday morning: How can it be that tax cuts are a winning message and that Conor Lamb, who ran against the GOP tax law, is winning because he was a \u201cconservative\u201d?\n\nRyan, growing tired at this line of questioning, cut me off and refused to answer.\n\nThe bottom line is is that the Republican spin is a show of some of the GOP\u2019s biggest vulnerabilities headed into the 2018 midterm election. Pennsylvania was an early test of GOP messaging and recruitment, and on both fronts they were slammed with a wave of Democratic enthusiasm.\n\nRepublicans have a lot of excuses for Pennsylvania\nIt\u2019s too early to make \u201csweeping predictions\u201d about the 2018 midterm election, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA), who chairs the House Republican conference warned reporters at the start of her weekly press conference Wednesday morning.\n\nRepublicans were ready to ward off any insinuation that the Pennsylvania special election was a bad omen for November.\n\nGOP staffers said Saccone was a bad candidate, despite the 60-year old state legislator and military veteran seemingly having a similar track record to many elected Republicans. \n\nStrategists pointed out that he was an unorganized campaigner who failed to adequately fundraise. \n\n\u201cFor any House GOP incumbents who have been coasting along and getting out-raised by their [Democratic] opponents, tonight should be a serious wake-up call no matter what happens,\u201d Brian Walsh, a Republican strategist tweeted. \u201cCampaigns matter.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Lamb\u2019s campaign outspent Saccone\u2019s and had a much more robust fundraising effort. But money wasn\u2019t an issue for the Republican candidate, who saw more than $7 million spent in his name from a variety of outside groups. \n\nMajority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy noted that the district had more registered Democrats than Republicans. The district has historically trended Republican for many years. Democrats didn\u2019t even challenge the Republican seat in 2014 and 2016.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers made sure to say the country hadn\u2019t yet experienced the \u201cfull momentum of tax reform.\u201d Once the voters truly see what the corporate tax cuts could do for them, the tide would change, she said.\n\nAnd as for Lamb, Ryan made his point very clear: He could have been the Republican.\n\nThe great contradiction in Republican\u2019s message\nRepublicans have hitched their cart to tax cuts. \n\nThe GOP tax bill loomed large over Saccone\u2019s campaign. Republicans groups spent millions trying to sell the policy to the district\u2019s Republican voters. Trump came to the district early to tout the policy\u2019s successes.\n\nIt didn\u2019t stick. In the final weeks, pro-Saccone advertising began focusing largely on immigration, crime, and tying Lamb to Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi \u2014 who Republicans have long used as the Democratic boogeywoman.\n\nNow, as the party watches Saccone fall behind, Republicans have changed their tune on one front. Lamb is no longer a Pelosi-liberal. He might as well have been a \u201cconservative\u201d Republican, Ryan said.\n\nPut together, these Republican messages raise a major contradiction.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that Lamb ran on a more moderate Democratic platform. He has shied away from criticizing Trump and said he would not support Pelosi for speaker. He came out against an assault weapons ban but supports stronger background check laws. \n\nHe is personally pro-life but supports the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to legalize abortion. He does not support a ban on abortions at 20 weeks. In other words, on policy, Lamb is a pro-choice Democrat. \n\nThe clear divisions between Lamb and the Republicans land on the core pillars of the Republican agenda. Lamb is opposed to repealing Obamacare and called the GOP tax bill a \u201cgiveaway\u201d to the wealthy.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t need to add a penny to our debt to have the tax cut for our working and middle-class people,\u201d Lamb said at a debate, butting heads with Saccone.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Zeeshan Aleem", "body": "Former White House strategist Steve Bannon has been refusing to answer lawmakers\u2019 questions about the Trump-Russia investigation \u2014 and they\u2019re so tired of it that they\u2019re considering holding him in contempt of Congress. \nThe House Intelligence committee could vote on whether or not to discipline Bannon as early as Monday. If lawmakers vote yes, there are three different kinds of contempt charges they could use. \nFirst, there\u2019s \u201cinherent contempt\u201d \u2014 which could result in Bannon being held in Congress\u2019s very own jail if he refuses to comply with their subpoena. But according to Andy Wright, a former White House lawyer in the Obama administration, that kind of measure hasn\u2019t been used in around a century and is unlikely to be taken up now.\nThere\u2019s also \u201ccriminal contempt,\u201d which means that Congress could turn to the Department of Justice to prosecute Bannon for refusing to comply with their subpoena. But that route also seems unlikely, since the Department of Justice has traditionally resisted prosecuting executive branch officials when they\u2019re following the president\u2019s orders.\nAnd finally, there\u2019s \u201ccivil contempt,\u201d a rare but occasionally used technique for obtaining information. Wright sees it as the most likely out of the three.\nIf Congress chooses the third, it would have to get a judicial order from a federal court to uphold the demand that Bannon testify. If the court decides that Congress is right, it could issue an order requiring the former White House strategist to testify \u2014 and arrest him for failing to follow that order. \nThe court could keep Bannon detained in jail until he agrees to cooperate with the order. And crucially, Wright says, Trump wouldn\u2019t be able to pardon Bannon if he was in jail for that reason.\nLawmakers are angry about Bannon\u2019s refusal to cooperate\nLawmakers are growing deeply impatient with Bannon\u2019s stonewalling on the Trump-Russia investigation.\nDuring a four-hour closed-door meeting with the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, Bannon refused to comply with most lawmakers\u2019 questions, except for 25 that had been prescreened by the White House. Bannon missed previously scheduled hearings and has now refused to answer questions three times in a row. \nMembers of Congress are angered by his behavior; they\u2019re trying to obtain vital information required for understanding the connections between Trump\u2019s affiliates and Russia. The House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation is running in parallel to separate investigations by the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Department of Justice.\nAfter Thursday\u2019s session, Rep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said he was \u201cnot okay\u201d with Bannon\u2019s refusal to cooperate with questions.\nBannon has repeatedly invoked executive privilege to justify his refusal to fully cooperate with the House probe \u2014 a legal claim the president can use to protect the confidentiality of his conversations, and that at times can apply to his staff. Some members of the committee were skeptical.\n\u201cThe breadth of that claim of executive privilege is breathtaking and insupportable and indeed, at times, it was laughable,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters Thursday.\nSome experts say that the White House\u2019s sweeping use of executive privilege to get its former staffers to block inquiries from lawmakers appears to be entering unprecedented legal territory. \n\u201cExecutive privilege is an amorphous concept,\u201d William Banks, a professor at the Syracuse University College of Law and a former special counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, told the Washington Times in January. \u201cIt has never been tested the way it could soon be tested.\u201d\nLawmakers want to force Bannon to take them seriously\nAnalysts say Bannon appears to be complying more with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia than with the House Intelligence Committee.\nAccording to NBC News, Bannon spent some 20 hours in conversations with Mueller\u2019s team this week. \nSome members of the House Intelligence committee reportedly believe Bannon is cooperating more with Mueller, who can more easily enforce subpoenas by threatening to apply criminal charges than lawmakers can.\nBannon\u2019s recent behavior has managed to do something exceedingly rare: unite Republicans and Democrats on the committee.\n\u201cAt some point, Congress\u2019s institutional interests outweigh their partisan interests,\u201d Wright told me. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for the committee\u2019s authority to look like it\u2019s toothless.\u201d\nHolding Bannon in contempt could be a way for the House committee to show that\u2019s not the case.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Alex Ward", "body": "Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis is about to face one of his biggest challenges since joining the Trump administration: handling incoming National Security Adviser John Bolton.\n\nMattis and Bolton are diametrically opposed on the two biggest national security issues facing the United States \u2014 North Korea and Iran. Mattis wants to keep the US in the Iran nuclear deal; Bolton previously advocated for bombing the country and removing the US from the agreement. And Mattis argues diplomacy is the best way to curb Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program, while Bolton warns against negotiations and last month advocated for striking North Korea.\n\nBut it gets worse for Mattis. Experts tell me Bolton is a seasoned bureaucratic infighter who has the skills to press forcefully for his views \u2014 and that could keep Trump from hearing Mattis\u2019s advice. \u201cThere is an open question about whether he will allow multiple views to be aired in front of the president,\u201d Evelyn Farkas, a former senior Pentagon official, told me. \u201cHis reputation is not good when it comes to how he has treated his colleagues in the past.\u201d \n\nAnd Mattis has already lost some leverage within Trump\u2019s team. President Donald Trump fired a key Mattis ally, Rex Tillerson, as his secretary of state two weeks ago, and it\u2019s rumored Chief of Staff John Kelly may soon head out the door. Mattis helped Kelly remove outgoing National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, in part because they fought over how to deal with North Korea. But now, ironically, Mattis has to contend with an even more pugnacious rival in the White House.\n\n\u201cI expect even more internal drama and choppy waters ahead for the Pentagon,\u201d Derek Chollet, a former top National Security Council (NSC) and Pentagon official, told me. \u201cThe tensions that existed with the NSC under McMaster are likely going to get exponentially worse.\u201d\n\nMattis has faced a lot of obstacles in his storied military and brief political career, but Bolton\u2019s appointment ranks high among them.\n\n\u201cThis will be a huge test for Mattis,\u201d Chollet told me. \n\nAdvantage: Bolton\nMatthew Waxman, a former senior official in the George W. Bush administration, wrote in Lawfare on Friday about why Bolton could be a formidable force in his new role.\n\n\u201cYes, Bolton is militantly aggressive about wielding American military and economic power,\u201d Waxman says, \u201c[b]ut what I saw in him also was an operator who was relentlessly effective in implementing \u2014 or stymying \u2014 policy, at least in the short term.\u201d It\u2019s worth recalling that Bolton learned from the best: He\u2019s a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of former Vice President Dick Cheney, a master bureaucratic pugilist.\n\nBolton also spent years in Republican administrations learning the ins and out of how to navigate the US capital. In his book Surrender Is Not an Option, he spends page after page self-servingly detailing his contempt for government agencies and career officials, and how he eventually outsmarted them all to make them adopt his points of view. (However, he is honest about how the Bush administration marginalized him while he served as the ambassador to the UN, preventing him from severing America\u2019s ties to the diplomatic body.)\n\nBolton has another big advantage over Mattis: He will likely hold multiple Oval Office meetings each day with Trump to discuss key issues from North Korea to Iran to Syria to Afghanistan. That will help him crowd out dissenting voices, including Mattis\u2019s.\n\nMattis, meanwhile, has very limited political experience. Joining Trump\u2019s Cabinet is his first foray into setting American foreign policy or navigating official Washington. That said, Mattis retired as a four-star general, which means he proved he can fight a good bureaucratic battle on his own \u2014 troops don\u2019t achieve four stars unless they know how to deal with Washington\u2019s egos.\n\n\u201cSecretary Mattis will work well with anyone the president selects for his team,\u201d Dana White, the Pentagon\u2019s top spokesperson, told me.\n\nBut Mattis famously formed a united front with Tillerson to push back against the president\u2019s worst foreign policy impulses \u2014 angering Trump along the way \u2014 and lost again and again. Here\u2019s just one example: Trump still plans to move the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem over Mattis\u2019s and Tillerson\u2019s objections.\n\nMattis remains in Trump\u2019s good graces, though, and there is no indication the secretary will leave the administration any time soon. Yet Bolton will likely form a mind meld with the president right away \u2014 they share similarly hawkish views \u2014 and try to bend the national security bureaucracy to his liking.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Mattis and Bolton\u2019s first skirmish may come sooner than you think.\n\nThe first potential Mattis-Bolton showdown is just weeks away\nTrump brought in Bolton now in part to have his national security team set ahead of two critical events: the decision about whether to remove the US from the Iran deal, and a potential summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nBolton is crystal clear about his feelings toward both countries. \u201cBolton\u2019s strong policy views are well-known, and he will be a forceful proponent of them in the Situation Room,\u201d William Inboden, a top NSC staffer in the George W. Bush administration, told me. \n\nDuring the early months of the Trump administration, then-White House senior strategist Steve Bannon approached Bolton as part of a plan to get around Cabinet members, like Mattis, who opposed withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nBolton then drafted a five-page memo detailing his proposal for tearing up the deal, which he then published in the National Review after Bannon departed the White House.\n\nAnd on February 28, Bolton published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal arguing that the US needed to solve the nuclear standoff with North Korea by force. \n\n\u201cPre-emption opponents argue that action is not justified because Pyongyang does not constitute an \u2018imminent threat.\u2019 They are wrong,\u201d Bolton wrote. \u201cIt is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current \u2018necessity\u2019 posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons by striking first.\u201d\n\nAs of now, all signs point to Trump removing the US from the Iran agreement on May 12. The problem is Trump plans to meet with Kim later that month. Breaking America\u2019s commitment to the nuclear deal could make it much harder for the US to have a successful summit with North Korea, experts say.\n\n\u201cIf I were the North Koreans, and Trump pulled out of the deal with Iran, why should I make an agreement?\u201d Frank Rose, a top arms control official at the State Department from 2014 to 2016, told me.\n\nBut that won\u2019t stop Bolton from encouraging Trump to follow his instincts on Iran and possibly scuttle any meeting with Pyongyang.\n\nThe question is if Mattis will be able to contain Bolton\u2019s most dangerous instincts. If he doesn\u2019t, Trump\u2019s best Cabinet member will find himself marginalized when he\u2019s needed most.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Anna North", "body": "The American public might be about to learn a lot more about President Trump\u2019s history with women \u2014 in court. \n\nKaren McDougal, a fitness expert and former Playboy model, filed suit on Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeking the right to speak publicly about an alleged affair between her and Trump. She\u2019s the second woman to file such a suit. Adult film actress Stormy Daniels sued Trump earlier this month.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, a New York Supreme Court judge ruled that a defamation suit filed against Trump by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice, could move forward. Zervos says that Trump sexually assaulted her in 2007.\n\nAs part of Zervos\u2019s suit, her lawyers have subpoenaed all Trump campaign documents dealing with \u201cany woman alleging that Donald J. Trump touched her inappropriately.\u201d The Trump team had sought to block the suit; now that it\u2019s moving forward, they might actually be forced to produce those documents, if they exist.\n\nTuesday\u2019s legal developments move the country that much closer to hearing the full story about Trump\u2019s past, including whether he authorized or had a hand in payoffs to women with whom he had extramarital affairs, and what his campaign knew about allegations of sexual misconduct against him.\n\nThey also chip away at the barriers \u2014 legal and otherwise \u2014 that Trump\u2019s associates appear to have created to keep women from talking about their experiences with the man who is now our president.\n\nKaren McDougal is suing for the right to tell her story about Trump\nIn documents reviewed by Ronan Farrow of the New Yorker, McDougal says she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007. In August 2016, after Trump won the Republican nomination for president, she signed away the rights to her story to American Media Inc. (AMI), the company that publishes the National Enquirer, according to Farrow.\n\nIn exchange, she got $150,000, 45 percent of which went to various middlemen, and was told that AMI would publish 100 fitness columns by her. The deal was apparently an example of a tactic called \u201ccatch and kill,\u201d in which David Pecker, the chair of AMI and a personal friend of Trump\u2019s, would buy the rights to a story only to make sure it never saw the light of day.\n\nBut now McDougal wants to speak out. So she\u2019s suing AMI, arguing that she was misled about the deal. Like Stormy Daniels, she is seeking \u201cdeclaratory relief\u201d \u2014 she wants the court to declare her deal with AMI invalid, which would help her tell her story publicly without fear of legal repercussions.\n\nAccording to Jim Rutenberg of the New York Times, McDougal says in her suit that when she signed the deal, she believed AMI would have to publish her columns \u2014 she later learned it only had \u201cthe right\u201d to publish them. The suit alleges that both McDougal\u2019s lawyer, Keith Davidson, and AMI\u2019s chief content officer, Dylan Howard, pressured McDougal to sign.\n\n\u201cAs A.M.I. and Mr. Davidson pushed her to sign the deal on Aug. 5, Ms. McDougal expressed misgivings,\u201d Rutenberg writes. \u201cBut, her suit says, Mr. Davidson and Mr. Howard argued in an urgent Skype call that the deal to promote her would \u2018kick start and revitalize\u2019 her career, given that she was \u2018old now.\u2019 She was 45.\u201d\n\nMcDougal\u2019s suit also says that Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, was secretly involved in her deal with AMI. Cohen paid $130,000 to Stormy Daniels in October 2016 in exchange for her promise not to speak out about Trump, a payment some say may have been an illegal campaign contribution. \n\nDaniels\u2019s suit is ongoing, and she is reportedly set to appear on 60 Minutes on March 25. McDougal\u2019s suit is sure to increase scrutiny on the president. \n\n\u201cThe lawsuit filed today aims to restore her right to her own voice,\u201d her new lawyer, Peter K. Stris, told the Times.\n\nSummer Zervos\u2019s lawsuit could expose even more allegations \nSummer Zervos\u2019s story about Trump starts around the same time as McDougal\u2019s. In December 2007, she says, she sought a meeting with Trump, hoping he could help her in her career. At the meeting, she says, he kissed her twice without asking; at a second meeting, at the Beverly Hills Hotel, she says he grabbed her breasts and pressed his genitals against her. \n\nZervos began speaking about her experiences publicly in October 2016, after she heard Trump talking about grabbing women \u201cby the pussy\u201d on the Access Hollywood tape. Trump pushed back, saying, \u201cevery woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign,\u201d and of Zervos specifically, \u201cI never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago.\u201d So in January 2017, Zervos sued for defamation \u2014 her suit argues that Trump\u2019s comments about her \u201chave been deeply detrimental to Ms. Zervos\u2019s reputation, honor and dignity.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have been trying to get the case dismissed. The Supreme Court decided in Clinton v. Jones, Paula Jones\u2019s sexual harassment lawsuit against Bill Clinton, that the president can be sued in federal court for \u201cunofficial acts\u201d \u2014 that is, actions committed outside his or her official capacity as president. Trump\u2019s lawyers argued, however, that the president could not be sued for such acts in state court. On Tuesday, a judge rejected that argument, allowing Zervos\u2019s case to go forward.\n\nThat means Trump\u2019s team might have to reveal campaign communications not just about Zervos, but about any woman who has accused Trump of sexual misconduct \u2014 including women who may not have gone public yet. Of course, Trump\u2019s lawyers will probably fight the subpoena \u2014 but on Tuesday, they lost an important battle in their effort to keep the case out of the public eye.\n\nAccounts from McDougal and others over the past few months have suggested a complex edifice built up around Trump \u2014 maintained by friends and lawyers, composed of money and nondisclosure agreements, and intended to protect Trump from having to face the consequences of women speaking publicly about their experiences.

Cohn, by contrast, was really a trader and a businessman and not an economist at all. \n\nThat said, by all accounts, Kudlow is being hired more for his presence as a media personality than for his academic chops. \n\nAs the New York Times reported in 1995, \u201cKudlow made a highly public confession of his drug problem shortly after he was forced to resign as chief economist at Bear Stearns\u201d after which he \u201cmade a fresh career start as a conservative political commentator for television and magazines.\u201d\n\nAs a media personality, Kudlow is a dogmatic supply-sider who tends to suggest tax cuts as a panacea for all ills. He also has highly questionable judgment as a prognosticator, publishing a column titled \u201cThe Bush Boom Continues\u201d on the inauspicious date of December 7, 2007, right as the economy was tumbling into the deepest, longest recession in decades. \n\nKudlow is also, interestingly, not necessarily closely aligned with Trump on issues that divide him from congressional Republicans. He blasted Trump\u2019s approach to trade with a quick column titled \u201cTariffs Are Taxes,\u201d which makes the accurate point that tariffs are taxes and thus dogmatically anti-tax conservatives should oppose them. \n\nTrump, rather famously, likes to watch many hours of television each day and believes that cable television is a good way to gather information, so it\u2019s natural that Kudlow would seem to him to be an authority on economic matters. Kudlow is also unquestionably \u201cgood on television\u201d and not necessarily a highly principled debater, so to the extent that Trump places a high priority on recruiting team members who will be effective surrogates on cable chat shows, Kudlow is likely to do a good job. \n\nHis ability to actually provide high-quality economic policy advice to the president seems more questionable.

Holding the Senate seat raises the prospect that Democrats could seize a majority there, pending the outcome of some legal wrangling. \nBoth seats were vacant because incumbents resigned under a cloud of sexual misconduct allegations, which is just one of the ways Minnesota is an interesting state in terms of our current politics. \nHillary Clinton carried it in 2016, but like the rest of the Midwest, it tilted strongly in Trump\u2019s direction relative to where it had been in 2012. Both of the districts that voted tonight followed that basic pattern. House District 23B voted by a narrow 3-point margin for Mitt Romney, but Trump won it in a 27-point landslide. Obama carried Senate District 54 by a fairly comfortable 7-point margin, but Trump eked out a 1-point victory. \nMinnesota has two US Senate elections this November, plus two open House races in seats being vacated by Democratic incumbents in districts Trump won, plus an upscale suburban House district represented by Erik Paulsen (R-MN) that\u2019s considered one of Democrats\u2019 top pickup opportunities. The state\u2019s political trends are of enormous national interest. Tonight\u2019s results carry no guarantees for November, of course, but they seem to indicate that Democrats are succeeding in rolling back recent GOP gains in the state. \nThe whole Minnesota state Senate is now in play\nWith Monday night\u2019s results, Republicans now hold a narrow 34-33 majority in the Minnesota state Senate \u2014 but that majority is at risk. When Sen. Al Franken resigned from the Senate, Gov. Mark Dayton appointed Lt. Gov. Tina Smith (D-MN) to fill the vacancy. That created a vacancy for the lieutenant governor job that, by statute, was automatically filled by state Senate President Michelle Fischbach, a Republican. \nFischbach views her elevation to the lieutenant governorship as essentially a dirty pool play by Minnesota Democrats to create a vacancy, so she has refused to relinquish her state Senate seat. Democrats are suing, arguing that the lieutenant governor can\u2019t also be a state senator and that Minnesota law does not allow Fischbach to refuse her promotion. \nDemocrats\u2019 hopes for securing the majority now rest on winning the lawsuit, creating the vacancy, and then winning the special election. Republicans will continue to control the Minnesota House one way or the other, so the short-term policy consequences here are not especially large. But as Democrats try to make a Trump-era down-ballot recovery, every little bit helps. \nDemocrats are cleaning up in special elections\nAccording to an extremely useful comprehensive spreadsheet compiled by Daily Kos, across 70 special elections in 2017, Democrats ran 10 points ahead of Clinton and 7 points ahead of Obama\u2019s 2012 results. Those numbers have accelerated into 2018. Across 11 races, Democrats are running 23 points ahead of Clinton and 8 points ahead of Obama. \nHistorically speaking, special election results usually are somewhat predictive of midterm general election outcomes, though I don\u2019t think anyone believes it\u2019s realistic for Democrats to obtain a nationwide 23-point swing relative to Clinton\u2019s numbers. \nIt\u2019s particularly interesting that Democratic results thus far show a much larger overperformance relative to Clinton in 2016 than to Obama in 2012. People who\u2019ve crunched the numbers in detail say that\u2019s because some Trump voters really are crossing over to vote for Democrats. \n\n\nJust to push back against the CW, the state legislative special election results so far being more correlated with 2012 than 2016 really implies that a lot of Trump voters must be voting for Democrats https://t.co/p6nbGofahN\u2014 ((David Shor)) (@davidshor) February 7, 2018\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the special elections are already having real-world impact. \nWisconsin Gov.

Trump never committed to liquidating the Trump business empire, which meant the country would find itself in an unprecedented situation fraught with peril.\n\nBut he brushed off these concerns with a range of arguments that critical masses of voters evidently found persuasive. He admitted that he\u2019d been greedy his whole life, but said that as president, \u201cI want to be greedy for the United States.\u201d He promised to separate himself from his businesses and put his assets in a blind trust. \n\nHe said he would put forward a tax plan that would cost him a \u201cfortune\u201d and bragged that as a wealthy business owner he bought and sold politicians, but as a politician he\u2019d be too rich to be bought. \n\nThis shtick became sufficiently embedded in the conventional wisdom around Trump that it even persuaded some prominent leftists who by no means actually agreed with the substance of Trump\u2019s agenda. \n\n\n\nBrother Bernie and Brother Trump are authentic human beings in stark contrast to their donor-driven opponents.\n\u2014 Cornel West (@CornelWest) August 25, 2015\n\n\n\n\nThe reality of Trump\u2019s presidency has been just the reverse. \n\nThere is nothing blind about his finances \u2014 his business empire is merely managed on a day-to-day basis by his adult sons, with whom he is in regular contact and who also work as leading members of his political operation. \n\nHis daughter and son-in-law serve as high-ranking officials in the White House, he operates a hotel in the nation\u2019s capital that serves as an informal headquarters for his administration, and he spends a majority of his weekends at his private resorts in Florida, Virginia, and New Jersey. \n\nSome of the grifting that results from this is almost comical, as in the periodic stories about the Secret Service spending thousands of dollars at a time renting golf carts from clubs that the president owns. \n\nBut lining his pockets with vast sums of public money is the least of the problems with Trump\u2019s conduct in this regard. The real issue is that by joining one of Trump\u2019s private clubs, wealthy individuals are putting cash directly in the president\u2019s pocket while also gaining access to him. Trump seems to regularly \u2014 and quite openly \u2014 poll Mar-a-Lago members for their thoughts on the issues of the day. But it\u2019s also an opportunity for more subtle lobbying in unprecedented ways.\n\nTrump\u2019s policymaking is riven with conflicts of interest\nRepublicans are, in a curious way, often less vulnerable to standard money-in-politics corruption narratives. There\u2019s always a solid baseline case that the reason the party of business and small government is making business-friendly regulatory decisions is ideological rather than pecuniary. \n\nTrump\u2019s regressive tax bill, for example, has almost certainly been a huge financial windfall to his club members. But to suggest a corrupt motive for a Republican president to push a regressive tax bill ignores the fact that all Republican politicians for the past couple of generations have pushed regressive tax bills. That Trump used to promise that he would raise taxes on the rich only to flip-flop later is striking, but ultimately not evidence of corruption.\n\nNot everything the administration does is so cut-and-dried. They proposed a bailout of the coal industry that so flagrantly violated free market principles, for example, that Trump\u2019s own appointees at the Federal Electrical Regulatory Commission ended up vetoing it. Trump\u2019s affinity for coal is, of course, well known. But the fact that the National Mining Association cut a big check to the Trump International Hotel in October can\u2019t have hurt. \n\nThe White House is also actively considering a proposal from the Commerce Department to impose stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. This idea is apparently hotly opposed by most of Trump\u2019s foreign and economic policy advisers. Yet as the administration deliberates, the fact that the Metals Service Center Institute, a trade group that favors anti-import measures, held last year\u2019s annual confab at the Trump Doral resort in Miami may play a role. \n\nThese examples, of course, are drawn from what\u2019s publicly known based on trade groups\u2019 formally announced events. The basic arrangement through which trade associations, political campaigns, and others seeking to curry favor with the president announce major events at Trump properties is obviously corrupt. But in any situation, the most corrupt behavior will be what\u2019s taking place in secret. \n\nWhat we don\u2019t know can hurt us\nThe governments of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Turkey are on the list of foreign powers that have held parties or conferences at Trump clubs and hotels. And though Trump promised that his family company would stop doing deals abroad during his presidency, Donald Trump Jr. recently took a shockingly corrupt trip to India, where he openly mixed his roles as a government spokesperson and as a salesperson. \n\nBut the greater danger is that the same channels through which detectable flows of money travel can also be used for secret payments. \n\nPoliticians have been bribed in the past, of course. But traditionally, to pull it off requires a level of subterfuge that is itself illegal and courts detection. Bribe money cannot be reported as such to the IRS, but hidden untaxed income \u2014 the proverbial cash in the freezer \u2014 has a way of getting you caught. \n\nTrump owns dozens of legitimate businesses, however, so bribe payments can be duly reported to the IRS as hotel rentals or real estate investments or whatever else. And he\u2019s broken with decades of precedent by declining to make his tax returns available to the public, while all his financial disclosure forms reveal is that he owns a lot of shell companies named after himself. \n\nOne of the cardinal rules of American election law is that politicians cannot take campaign funds for personal use. That\u2019s a critical line between a legitimate contribution and an illegitimate bribe. Trump, however, has erased this line. This weekend, he\u2019s expected to pop down to Mar-a-Lago not only to relax and charge the government for use of his golf carts but also to appear at fundraisers for the RNC and his reelection campaign. \n\nFor a politician to personally pocket campaign contributions is a serious crime, but hosting RNC fundraisers at Trump-owned properties completely eviscerates the spirit of those laws. Meanwhile, taking cues from the top, a general tendency toward poor ethics is spiraling down throughout the government.\n\nTrump\u2019s corruption is contaminating everything\nAn early Trump administration controversy that now seems almost quaint came when presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway used a television news appearance from the White House grounds to tout Ivanka Trump\u2019s shoe brand. It wasn\u2019t a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but this kind of low-level legal violation keeps happening in the Trump era, right up to an apparent Hatch Act violation from Jared Kushner as he touted Brad Parscale\u2019s appointment as campaign manager of the Trump 2020 reelection bid.  \n\nBut the list gets longer and contains more serious violations:\n\n\nThese kinds of problems will only grow worse the longer Trump\u2019s own conflicts of interests are permitted to go unabated. Maintaining a high standard of ethical conduct across a sprawling bureaucracy overseen by dozens of political appointees is genuinely challenging, even when elected officials are trying to do it. \n\nWhen the president of the United States doesn\u2019t care about ethics and the predominant attitude of his co-partisans in Congress is that ignorance is bliss, corruption will grow like mushrooms in the shade.\n\nThe GOP is all in on Trump\u2019s corruption\nDemocrats running in 2018 obviously must and will talk about their ideas on health care, jobs, education, environmental regulation, and more. Still, there is fundamentally no escaping the reality that Trump himself is the central political issue of our time. That\u2019s especially the case as long as the economic and military environment remains basically benign.\n\nAnd while there\u2019s plenty about Trump to criticize, not every target out there is actually all that sound. \n\nIn particular, while dwelling on Trump\u2019s racism is probably smart in some parts of the country, it runs the risk of implicitly conceding that Trump is on white America\u2019s side. The truth, however, is that Trump is on Trump\u2019s side. He\u2019s governing fully within the contours of a baseline pro-business agenda that differs from standard Republican fare largely insofar it involves personal enrichment in an unusual way. \n\nAnd, critically, the entire congressional Republican Party is in on it. Republicans can easily distance themselves from Trump\u2019s temperamental issues \u2014 Paul Ryan often sniffily declines to comment on stray Trump tweets \u2014 or dismiss the Russia issue as some kind of \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy. But the basic reality is that the reason we don\u2019t know who is paying Trump is because Republicans in Congress don\u2019t want us to know. \n\nAnd importantly, when Democrats are seeking to motivate their own base to turn out, checking Trump\u2019s corruption is a promise they can actually deliver on in the short term. Trump\u2019s clubs\u2019 financial records can be subpoenas. His tax returns can be released. Current and former government officials can be brought in to testify. \n\nNone of that will eradicate the inherent conflicts of interest involved in the current arrangement \u2014 for that, Trump himself will have to be defeated \u2014 but the veil of secrecy around Trump and money truly can be lifted. But to get there, Democrats will need to elevate the issue out of its current sleeper status and find a way to put it on the front pages.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jen Kirby", "body": "Thousands of people are expected to rally in Washington, DC, this weekend for a March for Our Lives protest on March 24 to advocate for gun control. Thousands more will join them at other marches in cities large and small across the country. \n\nTheir motto is #NeverAgain.\n\nThis march, which begins at noon Eastern time in Washington, DC, marks the second big push of teenage activism against gun violence in the wake of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Close to a million students stood up and streamed out of classrooms across the country last week as part of the National School Walkout. The protest honored the victims of the school Parkland shooting one month ago and called on lawmakers to pass gun control legislation. \n\nAnd another national school walkout is planned next month, on April 20, the anniversary of the Columbine shooting. \n\nThe survivors of the Parkland shooting spearheaded the March for Our Lives. Coming on the heels of the walkout on March 14, it is another early sign that this renewed push for gun reform is gathering strength. \n\nLane Murdock, a sophomore at Ridgefield High School in Connecticut who started a petition for the idea of an April 20 walkout, told Vox these protests are more than symbolic. They\u2019re the first step in a real grassroots movement for concrete changes to gun laws.  \n\n\u201cThere is a lot more to come,\u201d Murdock said. \u201cIt\u2019s big enough that it scares me. It\u2019s going to be hard \u2014 but it\u2019s realistic enough that I know we can get it done.\u201d\n\nWhat to expect in the March for Our Lives \nTeenage activists are preparing for two more major activist events in the coming weeks: March for Our Lives on Saturday, March 24, and a National School Walkout on April 20. \n\nSurvivors of the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School organized the March for Our Lives in Washington, DC, on March 24, with the support of Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun law reform advocacy group. \n\n\n\u201cA march to get the entire country to unite under one cause \u2014 it is the ultimate show of prominence and support and just rage toward the things that have been happening in our country for so long,\u201d Delaney Tarr, a 17-year-old senior at Stoneman Douglas, told Vox last month. \n\nIn Washington on March 24, protesters will march along Pennsylvania Avenue starting at 12 pm. The demonstration could draw as many as 500,000 people to the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cSibling marches\u201d are also planned in more than 800 cities worldwide from Maui to Lincoln, Nebraska, to Portsmouth, New Hampshire to Hong Kong. \n\n\n\nSeeing people all over the world prepare their signs for the marches, setting up their transportation (checkout what @lyft is doing)  getting their friends and families involved brings a tear to my eye.\n\nThis is a time of beautiful, beautiful unity. Be proud. #MarchForOurLives\n\u2014 Cameron Kasky (@cameron_kasky) March 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the 24th we\u2019ll take another major action together,\u201d March for Our Lives posted on its website in response to the walkouts. \u201cWe will keep up the pressure. Then we will take more action. This fall we will go and vote like no generation has in history. It is only when we show the collective strength of our voices, in the streets and at the voting booth, will they start to listen.\u201d\n\nExpect another big walkout on April 20\nA month after the march, students will walk out of classrooms against on April 20, the 19th anniversary of the Columbine shooting in Colorado. Murdock came up with the idea immediately after the Parkland shooting; she was tired of how numb America was becoming to yet another school shooting. \u201cBut I also just felt really powerless,\u201d Murdock told Vox. So, she thought, \u201cwhat could I do to help other kids who felt really powerless?\u201d\n\nOn the day of the Parkland shooting, Valentine\u2019s Day, she said, she created a petition: a rough outline of what she wanted to see happen, which was for kids to pledge to walk out. \u201cIt kind of blew up overnight,\u201d she said. \n\n\n\nToday\u2019s energy has been incredible, and we\u2019ve shown the world that we\u2019re serious.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the end.\n\nWe have to keep the momentum going with the April 20th #NationalSchoolWalkout. \n\nNext month, even more people will stand up to demand change.\n\nWe will not give up.\n\u2014 National School Walkout (@schoolwalkoutUS) March 14, 2018\n\n\n\n\nIndivisible, the progressive organizing group founded after the 2016 election, is backing the April 20 walkout, and helping Murdock and some of her fellow students organize. \n\nSome students who participated in the March 14 walkout told Vox they would also demonstrate on April 20, though not all had events planned. Students at more than 1,500 schools have signed up so far to participate, though that number will probably balloon as the date gets closer.\n\n\u201cApril 20 isn\u2019t the end of this,\u201d Murdock said. \u201cApril 20 is the launch. We want to make sure we take all this momentum, power, and interest and turn it into concrete, actual change.\u201d \n\nTeen activism is driving a new push for gun control \nThe Parkland survivors ignited a new gun control movement by finding a platform in their tragedy. David Hogg rode his bike to school after the shooting to film as a journalist and then found himself on Fox News, where he said there couldn\u2019t be another mass shooting. Emma Gonzalez\u2019s speech led to a chant: \u201cWe call BS.\u201d Cameron Kasky challenged Florida Sen. Marco Rubio on accepting donations from the National Rifle Association during a CNN town hall. \n\nStudent activists are tired of being numb to school shootings, of simply moving on, of referring to \u201canother\u201d school shooting. Some have watched guns steal away family, friends, and classmates.\n\nKari Gottfried, a junior at Corvallis High School in Oregon, is 17; she wasn\u2019t even born when the shooting at Columbine High School happened. \u201cI\u2019ve never known a world where there aren\u2019t mass shootings,\u201d she said. \n\nGottfried and her fellow student activists feel this issue personally. They were in middle school when the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting happened \u2014 old enough to understand the savagery, young enough to remember their own elementary school classrooms. They\u2019ve grown up with active shooter drills, watched protocol morph in response to the latest tragedy. Gottfried said that now if the fire alarm goes off, students are told to go into lockdown mode. \u201cIt\u2019s more likely there would be a shooter than a fire in Corvallis,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re no strangers to gun violence,\u201d Fiorina Talaba, an 18-year-old senior from Carson High in California, said of herself and her fellow students. \u201cWhen we heard about the shooting in Florida, it really spoke to us, and we wanted to have some type of change.\u201d \n\nThe teenage activists have another thing in common: social media. Students across the country are connecting with each other, sharing strategies and stories. Maxwell Nardi, an 18-year-old senior at Douglas S. Freeman High School in Richmond, Virginia, made the case that those who demeaned his generation for being obsessed with their phones are in for their own awakening. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting for this issue, were making our voices these tools,\u201d he said.\n\nArielle Geismar, a 16-year-old junior at the Beacon School in Manhattan, is organizing a bus down to DC for the March for Our Lives. She said she felt an \u201curgency of collaboration.\u201d \n\n\u201cOur generation is so easily discredited as the social media generation, always on our phones,\u201d she said. \u201cBut look what social media has done for this movement. It turned into this national thing.\u201d \n\nThe public pressure has pushed lawmakers to act\nStudents are also pushing for gun law reform with the National School Walkout. They\u2019re focusing on small actions \u2014 what teenagers can do to get more involved, including registering to vote and writing to lawmakers.\n\nBut they can already claim some victories. The big one: refusing to let the country move on and forget.\n\nThat has put pressure on lawmakers to act. Staunchly pro-gun Florida bucked the NRA to pass the first gun restrictions in the state in more than 20 years, in consultation with the families of Parkland victims. The law increased the age to purchase a firearm to 21, instituted a three-day waiting period, and created a system for police to petition to remove guns from someone deemed a threat. It put millions of dollars toward school safety and mental health initiatives, though it included a controversial, voluntary program to arm some school employees.\n\nDozens of other states passed new gun safety measured in the aftermath of Parkland or are mulling new restrictions. Kansas, New York, and some other states are considering legislation similar to Florida\u2019s that would allow for judges to temporarily remove guns if people are deemed a threat. These \u201cred flag laws\u201d existed in five states before the Parkland shooting. Rhode Island\u2019s governor signed an executive order to institute such a policy after Parkland. \n\nWashington state banned bump stocks, devices that effectively let semiautomatic weapons function like fully automatic ones. Cincinnati, Ohio, wants to do the same. Illinois is trying to pass a measure that would require criminal background checks for all gun shop employees; the Parkland shooting has reanimated debate over the legislation.\n\nAnd some states have backed away from loosening gun control laws. Iowa is letting a bill die that would have removed the permit requirement to carry weapons.\n\nThe Trump administration took steps to ban bump stocks in the wake of Parkland and just released a school safety plan. It calls for \u201crisk protection orders\u201d to confiscate weapons from those deemed a threat and has a proposal to arm teachers. \n\nIt also calls on Congress to pass the Fix NICS Act, a bipartisan bill introduced after the Sutherland Springs, Texas, shooting to strengthen the background check system. The White House\u2019s plan is largely NRA-friendly \u2014 but the White House did not take similar action in the wake of massacres in Las Vegas or Sutherland Springs. \n\nStudents activists said they\u2019re open to different ideas and debates about the Second Amendment. Geismar said she and her fellow activists are just looking for middle ground. \u201cIt\u2019s not Republican or Democrat; it\u2019s about keeping people safe,\u201d she said. \n\nTalaba said she and her fellow students were focused particularly on mental health. She believes tighter background checks will help. But she also sees that as a first incremental, achievable step.  \n\nThe walkout is a chance to stake out their role in this debate. \u201cI just don\u2019t like how congressmen, or these older people, just don\u2019t see that even us kids, we can have these very serious conversations,\u201d Talaba said. \u201cWe know what we want from our society: to have less guns and, at some point, no guns at all.\u201d\n\nIt is also a reminder for lawmakers to listen and take these student activists seriously. All they can do now is lobby for change. But soon they\u2019ll be the ones with the power to decide politicians\u2019 fates \u2014 if not in 2018, then in 2020. \n\nBut it\u2019s bigger than elections, and uncomfortable conversations. As Nardi, the senior from Richmond said, \u201cThis is literally matter of life and death.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matthew Yglesias", "body": "What\u2019s truly astounding about Conor Lamb\u2019s performance Tuesday night in a district Trump won by 20 points is that it isn\u2019t novel at all. \n\nLamb did 20 points better in PA-18 than Clinton did in 2016 and 17 points better than Obama did there back in 2012. That\u2019s impressive. What\u2019s even more impressive is if you look across 20 special elections held so far in 2018, mostly for state legislative seats, and discover that Democrats have done on average 24 points better than Clinton and 12 points better than Obama. \n\nToday the political class has started an autopsy of the Pennsylvania race \u2014 assessing Lamb\u2019s strength as a candidate and his opponent, Rick Saccone\u2019s, relative weaknesses. This same cycle has played out before this year: The morning after a race we pick it apart to see what happened. It\u2019s an understandable urge.\n\nBut these races aren\u2019t happening in isolation. The same dynamics are playing out over and over. And Republicans, especially, are desperately trying to interpret events as isolated campaigns gone awry. Instead of being terrified for scandal-free GOP incumbents holding down seats that Trump won by mere single-digits, they\u2019re staying the course. It\u2019s one of the signature aspects of the Republican Party in recent years \u2014 they resolutely refuse to act like they\u2019re afraid of anything. \n\nThis all might be good news for Democrats and professional pros, but it\u2019s a terrible sign for America.\n\nThe Trump-era GOP\u2019s bizarre synthesis\nRight up until Election Day 2016, Trump and congressional Republicans had a deeply uneasy relationship. \n\nOn the one hand, Trump viewed the overarching political philosophy of the GOP with barely concealed disdain and mused aloud as a candidate about the merits of universal health care and taxing the rich while promising to preserve Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid from cuts. \n\nHe suggested he\u2019d be tougher on the banks than Hillary Clinton and vowed to preserve basic clean air and clean water protections even while rolling back Obama\u2019s actions on climate change. Paired with an amped-up and heavily racialized version of cultural conservatism, this apparent ideological heterodoxy helped Trump score unprecedented success with working-class white voters.  \n\nAnd make no mistake \u2014 Trump was seen by the voters as the most moderate GOP nominee since Gerald Ford, positioned as slightly closer to the center than Bill Clinton in 1992.\n\nAt the same time, congressional Republicans viewed Trump as a dangerous figure with nearly one-third of the Senate GOP caucus refusing to commit to voting for him and House Speaker Paul Ryan famously proclaiming in October 2016 that he would no longer defend or campaign with Trump. \n\nDespite the internal tension and the 2-point popular vote loss, Trump emerged victorious in 2016; the way was clear for a potential juggernaut moving forward. If the GOP could adopt Trump\u2019s ideological synthesis while backing away from Trump\u2019s most disreputable personal qualities they\u2019d be positioned to do extremely well. \n\nBut instead they\u2019ve done the opposite. Trump behaves as flagrantly inappropriately as ever but now the entire party is complicit in it. In exchange, they\u2019ve gotten Trump to largely drop his eclectic policy approach in favor of a less-popular hard-right agenda. And now they\u2019re prepared to lose everywhere. \n\nAmerica needs the GOP to pull out of the tailspin\nThat Republicans manage to be doing so poorly with the economy humming along nicely is a godsend to Democratic Party operatives and political pros. But the foundation of that political success is a substantive disaster for the country. \n\nOn a policy level, the Trump-era GOP is pushing unpopular policies on all fronts, from the looming deportation of DREAMers to health care executive actions that are driving up premiums to rolling back net neutrality to dismantling consumer financial protection rules. These are enormously harmful to the short-term interests of millions of people and to the long-term interests of nearly the entire country. \n\nAt the same time, Trump continues to act like a maniac \u2014 just this week he fired the secretary of state over Twitter, deployed inappropriate political rhetoric at an official speech to active-duty Marines, and denied Russian culpability for assassinations carried out on British soil \u2014 and it\u2019s only Wednesday. \n\nAt the same time, he\u2019s enmeshed in an unprecedented level of personal corruption; his business enterprises are set up as perfect vehicles for interest groups seeking favors from the government to line his pockets with cash. And the growing Stormy Daniels scandal suggests a whole new dimension of possible corruption and lawbreaking over and above the basic financial conflicts of interest and the shenanigans with the Russians. \n\nThe American system, fundamentally, is meant to run more on prudence and separation of powers than on relentless partisan warfare. Congressional Republicans are supposed to see that Trump\u2019s corruption and aberrant behavior are unpopular and do what they can to check him, while Trump is supposed to see that the GOP policy agenda is extreme and unpopular and do what he can to trim its sails. If they did that, the fundamentally benign economic and international climate might assert itself and they\u2019d win the midterms. \n\nInstead, Trump and congressional Republicans are acting like Thelma and Louise holding hands as they drive the car off the cliff. \n\nThe special election results out of Pennsylvania and elsewhere are a welcome reminder that there really are consequences for political malpractice. But the worry has to be that the longer we stay on this path, the higher the chances are that we\u2019ll all end up paying the price.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Zack Beauchamp", "body": "Sunday\u2019s election in Russia, a rigged affair that Vladimir Putin won handily, seems on its face a testament to the strength of his regime. Putin staged a simulacrum of democracy, handed himself another term in office, and faced little in the way of opposition throughout the whole process.\n\nBut this interpretation papers over a deeper and more fundamental flaw in Putin\u2019s government. While Putin himself has a secure hold on power for the foreseeable future, he will eventually grow old and die. And the government he has created is so dependent on him that no one knows who \u2014 or what \u2014 will take over when he\u2019s gone.\n\nThis is not merely a problem for Putin (age 65) and Russia. Strongmen in other major countries, like Egypt\u2019s Abdel Fattah el-Sisi (63) and China\u2019s Xi Jinping (64), aren\u2019t young men. All of these leaders have created political systems that revolve around their own personal influence and support networks. But the problem with strongman rule is that the strongmen are not immortal, and once they fall ill or die, it\u2019s not obvious who will replace them.\n\nIronically, the very means they have used to secure power for themselves in the short run have created a fundamental threat to their regimes in the long run.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that the governments of Russia, China, or Egypt will necessarily collapse.  Plenty of political systems led by strongmen who died in office, like Hafez al-Assad in Syria and Turkmenistan\u2019s Saparmurat Niyazov, have successfully managed to hand over power to a chosen successor after their deaths.\n\nBut the best political science research we have suggests that transition in systems like this is always much less secure, and more likely to produce political instability or even violence, than democratic elections \u2014 or even other kinds of authoritarian systems, like hereditary monarchies.\n\nIf you look at the geopolitical events of the past several years, it\u2019s easy to think that authoritarianism is ascendant. Domestic problems in leading democracies like the United States and the United Kingdom, the slide toward strongman rule in places like Turkey and Hungary, and the rising global assertiveness of Russia and China all suggest to some that the future may belong to authoritarians. \n\nBut that analysis assumes these authoritarian governments are actually as stable as they seem. And that\u2019s not true. \n\nThe world\u2019s strongmen may reign for years, perhaps decades \u2014 but their inevitable deaths will expose political systems built on rickety foundations. Sometime in the not-so-distant future, the cracks will start to show.

At the time, Hill was working at the Brookings Institution, a centrist Washington think tank; today she is in the White House, serving as the National Security Council\u2019s senior director for Russia.\n\nHill\u2019s paper begins with a stark warning: Putin\u2019s push to centralize power has made the Russian political system remarkably vulnerable if he\u2019s forced out of power or dies in office.\n\n\u201cThe increased preponderance of power in the Kremlin has created greater risk for the Russian political system now than at any other juncture in recent history,\u201d Hill writes. \u201cPutin has the capacity to designate a successor ... but even this could prove a heavy lift for the system.\u201d\n\nHill points to several features of the Russian political system that would make it tough for \u201cthe next Mr. Putin,\u201d as she puts it, to emerge. The first is that Putin\u2019s government depends heavily on personal loyalty. \u201cThe elites who have clout,\u201d she writes, \u201chave been recruited from a network of personal relationships spanning Putin\u2019s youth in Soviet Leningrad and his entire career.\u201d \n\nThere is no guarantee that those people could be counted on to remain loyal to any one successor rather than devolving into infighting over who gets to control what after Putin\u2019s death. Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin\u2019s death in 1924, to take one historical example, triggered a violent factional dispute in the Soviet Communist Party \u2014 one that ended only when a particularly ruthless Soviet official named Josef Stalin managed to consolidate power. \n\nA second flaw in Putin\u2019s system, Hill suggests, is the way it celebrates the personal qualities of the man himself. Official Russian propaganda emphasizes his strength and manliness \u2014 see all of those famous shirtless photo ops \u2014 depicting him as a kind of father figure for the Russian state. \n\nPutin has played up this cult of personality, doing things like taking phone calls from random Russian citizens on television to emphasize his personal role in solving people\u2019s problems. If Putin is \u201cincapacitated in some way,\u201d Hill warns, \u201cthis changes the system\u2019s operating context.\u201d\n\nA third issue \u2014 and perhaps the most fundamental \u2014 is that Putin hasn\u2019t built up a strong political party to solidify his regime. United Russia, the leading Putin-aligned faction in Russia\u2019s legislature, doesn\u2019t have much in the way of actual governing responsibilities; it mostly rubber-stamps Putin\u2019s decisions. \n\nReal political parties, like the Communist Party in the Soviet Union, can handpick successors and help facilitate a smooth transfer of power. Without a strong party, Putin\u2019s eventual death or retirement is significantly more likely to kick off factional infighting between Putin\u2019s cronies and unrest among the greater Russian public.\n\n\u201cMost observers have no idea how [his] succession is going to play out. I don\u2019t think Putin himself even knows what he\u2019s going to do,\u201d Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a Russia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told me.\n\nThere are ways to stave off this problem \u2014 and Putin shows no signs of ill health, which means he should have quite a few years left to work on this problem. But the issues that complicate his succession aren\u2019t small things. They are fundamental problems that stem from the nature of the government he\u2019s built. \n\nIn order to fix things, Putin would need to undo the very factors that make his government durable in the short term: his installation of loyal cronies throughout the government, his development of a cult of personality in the Russian press, and his decision to keep political parties weak to forestall challengers. Trying to cement his legacy would, somewhat ironically, jeopardize his own power. \n\nIt\u2019s possible that Russia muddles through this, and that Putin\u2019s allies settle on a consensus successor choice who can carry on the predecessor\u2019s policies. But that\u2019s not a guarantee, and there could be lots of instability on the way. It may take years, or even decades, but it could be very bloody once it comes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a question I like to ask Russia specialists: \u2018If Putin has a heart attack tomorrow, what happens?\u2019 Nobody knows,\u201d Milan Svolik, a Yale University expert on authoritarianism, told the New York Times. \n\nIt\u2019s not just Russia: other large authoritarian countries have similar problems\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n      \n      \n        (Lintao Zhang/Pool/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nRussia is not the only country with a political system like this. It actually fits a familiar archetype among political scientists called, somewhat clunkily, \u201cpersonalist authoritarianism.\u201d\n\nIn personalist systems, all power flows from the figure at the top. Leaders systematically weaken any other potential source of political power, maintaining their influence through repression and the dispensation of favors to a favored elite. The official state ideology tends to emphasize the personal strength and qualities of the autocrat, as opposed to some kind of broader ideological foundation. Everything centers on one man (and yes, historically, it\u2019s almost always a man).\n\nNot all authoritarian countries are personalist. Saudi Arabia, for example, is a hereditary monarchy; power is vested in the royal family as a unit rather than the king alone. And the Soviet Union was a one-party state, where the Communist Party \u2014 not a single person \u2014 shaped the system. \n\nThese types of regimes have fewer issues with succession than personalist ones. Kings have crown princes to take over when they die, and party leaders can vote on the next premier. But in a personalist regime, all power and legitimacy rests in the Big Man. Without him, it\u2019s not obvious who gets to take over next, which means that the leader\u2019s death is more likely to create a crisis.\n\nStatistical research by Kendall-Taylor and Michigan State\u2019s Erica Frantz shows that monarchies and one-party dictatorships tend to hold together even after an individual king or strongman dies. That\u2019s not true for regimes like what Putin has created in Russia or what Xi is creating in China and Sisi is building in Egypt, which are far more brittle \u2014 and far likelier to collapse when the individual leader dies or is pushed out of power.\n\n\u201cThe more concentrated that power is in the regime, the more likely that you\u2019re going to see change in the wake of a leader\u2019s death,\u201d as Frantz put it to me in an interview.\n\nThis should raise alarm bells about the future stability of both Egypt and, more surprisingly, China.\n\nEgypt is a kind of twist on the Russian system. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, like Putin, has turned himself into a kind of Big Man who rules based on dispensing favors to build loyalty and a sense that he, personally, is the nation\u2019s savior. \n\nUnlike Putin, he came from a military background and rose to power in a 2013 coup (which had significant public backing). This means that current and former military officers make up the hardest core of Sisi\u2019s support inside the Egyptian government; his regime looks more like a military junta than Putin\u2019s.\n\nBut the Egyptian military, as far as anyone can tell, does not have a plan for what happens when Sisi goes. He has managed to centralize so much power in his own person that no one seems like a possible replacement. The result is that his departure, through either death or incapacitating illness, could kick off an intra-military power struggle or even another popular uprising.\n\n\u201cThe only thing anyone can say with some degree of certainty ... is that the next president will come from the military. The question is how that will happen,\u201d Sahar Aziz, an Egypt expert at Rutgers University, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen through an election,\u201d she added.\n\nChina would seem to be relatively immune from a succession crisis. Like the Soviet Union, China has a strong political party that\u2019s ostensibly tasked with picking the country\u2019s next leader. It has done so successfully three times in the past 30 years, handing power from Deng Xiaoping to Jiang Zemin to Hu Jintao to Xi Jinping.\n\nBut Xi has decided to break the mold, working to marginalize his opponents inside the Communist Party and centralize power in his own figure. Chinese state propaganda has started celebrating Xi in a manner similar to the way Russian media celebrates Putin; \u201cXi Jinping Thought,\u201d the leader\u2019s personal ideology, was recently officially added to the Chinese constitution.\n\nMost tellingly, Xi recently abolished term limits for the presidency, which most China watchers took as a sign that he is attempting to stay in power for life. This is a massive break with the past: The term limits were set up by Deng Xiaoping to ensure a regular and party-determined handover of power, giving institutions power over any one leader. Abolishing them is the biggest step yet toward a kind of Putinism with Chinese characteristics.\n\nChina is essentially a hybrid between a one-party state and a personalist regime \u2014 and strongly trending in the latter direction. The more Xi marginalizes the party and concentrates power in his own hands, the less stable the Chinese system will be when he leaves office. \n\n\u201cXi\u2019s moves surely extend his time in office, but they are likely to make that regime more fragile among his departure,\u201d said Frantz. \u201cAs power becomes more concentrated in places that historically have strong parties ... the regime lasts less time than it would have otherwise.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line is that the problem of succession is not just one for Vladimir Putin\u2019s government. It\u2019s one that afflicts the many personalist autocracies around the world, including powerful countries like Egypt and (increasingly) China.\n\nAnd what makes the Russia-Egypt-China triumvirate so interesting is that their leaders are all around the same age. That means it\u2019s at least theoretically possible that three large and extremely important countries will face major succession crises \u2014 conflict between regime elites or popular uprisings \u2014 around the same time.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate the significance such events could have for world politics. Yet that\u2019s the reality we may see in the not-distant future. And it\u2019s one that bears serious thought as we discuss another global political crisis \u2014 the alleged crisis of Western democracy.\n\nWhy the succession problem is good news for democracy\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        A pro-democracy protest in Turkey.\n      \n      \n        (Chris McGrath/Getty Images)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThere\u2019s been a series of examples in the past two decades or so of democracies sliding toward personalist autocracies.\n\nIn Venezuela, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, a democratically elected president, packed the country\u2019s Supreme Court with his allies and locked up human rights activists; his successor, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has ruled as a flat-out autocrat. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has amended the country\u2019s constitution to grant himself sweeping powers and forcibly seized control of Zaman, a major newspaper that had been critical of his rule. And there are signs of this creeping authoritarianism in European countries like Hungary and Poland.\n\nThere is even a sense among major Western countries, in the wake of Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, that democracy is becoming less attractive as a political model. A recent report from the National Endowment for Democracy, a US government institution, argues that Russia and China have attempted to weaken faith in democracy. In different and uncoordinated ways, the two countries are working to prop up their kind of authoritarian systems as more attractive alternatives. \n\n\u201cThe decision makers in Beijing and Moscow clearly have the political will and the resources to build up and implement their influence efforts. By comparison, the United States and other leading democracies seem to have withdrawn from competition in the ideas sphere,\u201d the report\u2019s authors conclude. \u201cThe authoritarian initiatives themselves are truly global in scope, turning up in democratic countries on every continent.\u201d\n\nThe general zeitgeist is one of a decadent democratic West and ascendant authoritarian East. But we risk assuming that things will remain this way at our peril.\n\nIf expert assessments and political science research on personalism tell us anything, it\u2019s that the kind of authoritarian governments that seem on the rise now are brittle. They depend heavily on the whims and efficacy of one man, a man who \u2014 like all other men \u2014 will get sick and die. \n\nEven short of that, these leaders have to play a delicate balancing act with their elites, courting allies who can prop them up without allowing for the emergence of a viable challenger. And they need to keep their populations at least complacent about authoritarian rule.\n\nDemocracy, by contrast, is built to survive more than one leader. The entire point of the system is to ensure changeover, to give the people a reason to believe in their governments and support them regardless of who is in power. In the long run, democracies are less prone to crisis and collapse than their authoritarian competitors \u2014 and that could end up making democracy the clearly more attractive model internationally once again.\n\nThe point, then, is that the sense of democratic crisis that permeates today\u2019s politics may eventually prove ephemeral. It could be that we\u2019re merely at an ebb in the democratic tide; that what\u2019s coming in the next 20 years isn\u2019t a further decline in democracy but a new crisis of authoritarianism.\n\nSo the next time you read something about Putin\u2019s strength and ambitions, remember one vital fact: His days are numbered. And what he has is not built to last.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Zack Beauchamp", "body": "John Bolton will officially become President Trump\u2019s third national security adviser on April 9. And after that, the risk of the United States getting into another devastating war \u2014 or two \u2014 will rise substantially.\n\nVipin Narang, an MIT political scientist, estimated in a tweet that Bolton\u2019s appointment alone raised the risk of war with North Korea by four times. Michael Horowitz, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, responded by saying he had revised his estimation upwards by a factor of five.\n\nNor is Bolton alone in his hawkishness. Trump\u2019s pick for his new secretary of state, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, is a vocal opponent of the nuclear deal with Iran who has called for strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. More recently, he\u2019s mused about regime change in North Korea.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful we will find a way to separate that regime from this system,\u201d Pompeo said in a 2017 interview. \u201cThe North Korean people, I\u2019m sure are lovely people and would love to see him [Kim Jong Un] go.\u201d\n\nEqually important are the people Bolton and Pompeo are replacing. Outgoing National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster was relatively hawkish on Korea, but was a staunch voice for preserving the Iran Deal. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is a relative dove on both issues; he also believed in keeping the Iran deal in place, and has repeatedly and publicly reached out to North Korea to try to come to a diplomatic solution to the nuclear crisis.\n\nThe current cabinet shakeup reflects Trump\u2019s desires to eliminate the people who saw their jobs as restraining him, and replacing them with people who are more likely to enable him\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether or not Trump wants war with North Korea or Iran. But he appears to be systematically replacing the top advisers who have put the breaks on his more hawkish impulses \u2014 the so-called \u201cadults in the room\u201d \u2014 and replacing them with people who are likely to push for military solutions. Jeremy Bash, a former chief of staff at the both the CIA and the Defense Department, said on MSNBC Friday morning that Trump is \u201cassembling a war cabinet\u201d \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to argue with him.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018axis of adults\u2019 era is officially over,\u201d says Derek Chollet, senior advisor for security and defense policy at The German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s possible we\u2019re entering the era of Trump unbound \u2014 with all of the instability that entails.\n\nWhy Trump\u2019s hawkish team is so dangerous\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Mike Pompeo.\n      \n      \n        (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThe early theory of the Trump administration was that the \u201caxis of adults,\u201d as Chollet puts it, could keep Trump from launching a war, tearing up US alliances, or any other rash and dangerous decision. Officials like McMaster, Tillerson, and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, the thinking went, would corral the inexperienced and inattentive president and essentially ensure that traditional American foreign policy remained in place.\n\nThis theory didn\u2019t work out very well in practice.  Examples include Trump deciding to move the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem \u2014 which experts say as already made it harder for the US to broker an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal,  the withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, decertifying Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal, and imposing dangerous tariffs on steel and aluminum imports because he was angry about bad press coverage.\n\nThe issue, accounts from inside the White House suggest, is that Trump despised the notion that he needed to be managed by \u201cadults,\u201d and told to ignore his own feelings in favor of what his advisors told him. Trump always hated the Iran deal, the Paris agreement, and all the rest \u2014 and deeply resented being told to ignore them. \u201cAides say the quickest way to get Trump to do something is to tell him he can\u2019t,\u201d as Axios\u2019s Mike Allen puts it.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the so-called adults were entirely ineffectual. They reportedly played a role in convincing Trump to stay in the Iran deal, rather than tearing it up entirely \u2014 which he seems to want to do. They prevented him from fatally undermining NATO and managed to quietly take some steps, like sending US troops to Poland, to challenge Russia. Rather, it\u2019s that the adults were merely a haphazard and ineffectual barrier against Trump\u2019s instincts \u2014 which, contrary to some popular myths, have always been quite hawkish.\n\nAnd that, in many ways, is the critical point here. After a little over a year, Trump is now more confident in his own judgments and political impulses. The current cabinet shakeup reflects Trump\u2019s desires to eliminate the people who saw their jobs as restraining him, and replacing them with people who are more likely to enable him.\n\n\u201cA dozen people close to Mr. Trump or the White House, including current and former aides and longtime friends, described him as newly emboldened to say what he really feels and to ignore the cautions of those around him,\u201d the New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman reports. \u201cThat self-confidence has led to a series of surprising comments and actions that have pushed the Trump presidency in an ever more tumultuous direction.\u201d\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that Trump is intentionally laying the groundwork for two new wars. Trump\u2019s feelings on war with North Korea and Iran are, like on so many issues, extremely hard to pin down. He\u2019s threatened to hit North Korea with \u201cfire and fury like the world has ever seen,\u201d but also accepted an offer to meet with Kim Jong Un face-to-face. He wants to tear up the Iran deal, but has proposed an unspecified \u201cbetter deal\u201d \u2014 not war \u2014 as the alternative.\n\nRather, it\u2019s that the kind of people who Trump feels more comfortable with \u2014 the ones who he feels reflect his instincts and approach to the job most closely \u2014 are people on the extremely hawkish far-right. And the more power these people have, meaning direct access to the president and control over the national security bureaucracy, the more likely they are to be able to push their ideas.\n\nWith Trump, a lot of things hinge on turning his vague feelings \u2014 North Korea can\u2019t be allowed to threaten the United States, the Iran deal is a disaster \u2014 into concrete and actionable policies. Officials who Trump thinks speak for him are more likely to convince that their policy ideas represent an authentic articulation of the president\u2019s vision.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Bolton and Pompeo are savvy bureaucratic operators. There were similarly radical figures in the early Trump administration, like former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and senior strategist Steve Bannon. But the two men were relatively unskilled at bureaucratic infighting. Take the executive order banning citizens of several Muslim countries from entering the US: Bannon\u2019s failure to understand law and the bureaucracy turned the rollout of this Muslim ban into a catastrophe that\u2019s still tied up in court.  They were no match for people like Mattis, who has somehow managed to exercise a restraining influence on the president and remain in his good graces. \n\nMatthew Waxman, a former Bush administration official who worked with Bolton during his several year-long tenure at the State Department, experienced this firsthand.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a masterful bureaucratic tactician,\u201d Waxman wrote in a Friday piece for Lawfare. \u201cRather than just adding a Fox-newsy ideologue who shifts the balance of the administration team\u2019s view further toward the president\u2019s most hawkish outlook, Trump has added someone who can actually help him make that outlook into reality.\u201d\n\nBolton and Pompeo, unlike Flynn and Bannon, are demonstrably good at this game \u2014 and Bolton, at least, is more hawkish than his predecessors. Mattis is running low on allies, with Tillerson and National Economic Council chair Gary Cohn out. And Trump himself seems to feel emboldened to do...well, whatever it is that he wants to do.\n\nBolton will take office soon. Pompeo will as well, if he makes it through his Senate confirmation process, which seems likely. Trump has reshuffled his cabinet before, and will probably do so again. But pay close attention to what these two men do in their new jobs. Every day those two are in their jobs, the risk of a major war will remain far above what we\u2019re used to \u2014 and, frankly, what we should be comfortable with.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Alex Ward", "body": "President Donald Trump\u2019s unprecedented attacks on federal law enforcement turned even more vindictive over a series of jarring events last weekend.\n\nThe drama began with the late Friday night firing of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe just 26 hours before he would have qualified for a full federal pension. It ended Sunday with a string of presidential tweets attacking McCabe, former FBI Director James Comey, and special counsel Robert Mueller. Trump had never before attacked Mueller by name in a tweet. \n\nTaken together, the weekend\u2019s developments show that Trump\u2019s war with US law enforcement has entered a new phase and that the president and his loyalists feel more emboldened to attack Mueller and others working on the Trump-Russia probe directly. It also raised new fears that Trump would take the extreme step of actually firing Mueller himself \u2014 a move that both Democrats and Republicans say would spark a constitutional crisis. \n\n\u201cThis is an escalation because it\u2019s open warfare against the special counsel by name, and it\u2019s capping off a 10-month effort to thwart the FBI and Mueller,\u201d Andy Wright, a professor at Savannah Law School, told Vox. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happens next because we\u2019re in uncharted territory.\u201d\n\nMcCabe\u2019s ouster late Friday night raised eyebrows throughout Washington because of its seeming spitefulness \u2014 the move could cost him his benefits \u2014 and because it came after Trump spent months publicly calling for his head. \n\nMcCabe, according to someone close to him, never spoke with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, FBI Director Christopher Wray, or Trump about his termination. Instead, he found out after someone close to him read Sessions\u2019s firing statement to him over the phone. The statement had already appeared on TV by that point; McCabe received an email about his ouster mere minutes before Sessions made the announcement but didn\u2019t see it in time.\n\nMcCabe\u2019s firing also set the stage for a dramatic escalation of Trump\u2019s standoff with Mueller. Early Saturday morning, Trump\u2019s lead personal lawyer John Dowd told reporters that Mueller\u2019s probe should end, pointing to McCabe\u2019s firing as a sign the whole investigation is tainted.  \n\nHours later on Saturday, reports surfaced that McCabe took notes of his interactions with Trump and gave them to Mueller. McCabe\u2019s onetime boss, Comey, also kept notes about his interactions with the president because he worried Trump would lie about them. \n\nIt\u2019s not clear if McCabe had similar concerns, but he might be able to corroborate Comey\u2019s claim that Trump pressured him to end the FBI\u2019s probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. If he does that, that makes Mueller\u2019s obstruction of justice case much stronger.\n\nAnd last but certainly not least, Trump spent his Sunday morning firing off tweets directed at McCabe, Comey, and Mueller. Trump accused Comey of lying under oath; questioned the existence and validity of McCabe\u2019s memos; and criticized Mueller by name for allegedly filling the ranks of his team of prosecutors and investigators with Democrats.\n\nMueller and Comey didn\u2019t comment, but McCabe issued a fiery statement on Friday arguing that he\u2019d been purposefully, and cruely, \u201csingled out\u201d by the president.\n\nIf you missed any of last weekend\u2019s events, don\u2019t worry. Here\u2019s a guide to one of the most dramatic \u2014 and potentially most legally and politically significant \u2014 weekends in months.\n\nSessions fired McCabe \u2014 and McCabe fired back at Trump\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.\n      \n      \n        Stephen Lam/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThe Trump administration argues that there were legitimate grounds for firing McCabe right before he\u2019d be eligible for his full pension. \n\nHere\u2019s why: Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz found that McCabe inappropriately allowed two top officials to speak to reporters in 2016 about his decision to open a case into the Clinton Foundation. This incident was under investigation as part of a broader look into how the FBI and Justice Department handled themselves during the most recent presidential election.\n\nAccording to reports about the watchdog\u2019s conclusion, which is still under wraps, McCabe apparently misled investigators during an interview with the inspector general, a charge McCabe denies. Still, that led to a recommendation that Sessions should fire McCabe \u2014 a recommendation Sessions acted on last Friday night.\n\n\u201cThe FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability. As the OPR proposal stated, \u2018all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand,\u2019\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement provided by the Justice Department. \n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Sessions had to recuse himself from the Mueller probe due to his interactions with Russians as a member of the Trump campaign, which calls into question his involvement in McCabe\u2019s ouster.\n\nLeading Democrats and Republicans criticized the timing of McCabe\u2019s firing, which seemed vindictive given how many of the benefits he earned over the course of a two-decade career are now at risk. \n\nBeyond the timing, though, many Democrats also warned that the move looked like political payback by a White House that has been attacking McCabe by name for months.\n\nTrump\u2019s anger toward McCabe goes back to a long-running controversy over his wife\u2019s alleged political ties to Hillary Clinton. In 2015, McCabe\u2019s wife ran for a state Senate seat in Virginia, backed in part with money provided by the state Democratic Party and Terry McAuliffe, a prominent Clinton ally. \n\nTrump and other Republicans have argued that those financial donations meant that McCabe was a partisan secretly harboring an anti-Trump agenda. Trump also made it personal: He once asked McCabe what it was like to have a \u201closer\u201d wife.\n\nTrump, who has tweeted about his anger over the McCabes for months, made reference to his long-standing ire again on Saturday.\n\n\n\nThe Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught, called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife\u2019s campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation? How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 17, 2018\n\n\n\n\nBeyond that, McCabe himself was ensnared in controversy over text messages that Peter Strzok, an FBI agent, sent to federal attorney Lisa Page. Strzok had mentioned someone named \u201cAndy\u201d in a text message to Page, suggesting there was a discussion about Trump \u2014 and not a positive one \u2014 in McCabe\u2019s office. Conservative media harped on this text, implying that McCabe was part of a grand anti-Trump conspiracy.\n\nOthers in the GOP came to McCabe\u2019s defense after the firing. \u201cHe should have been allowed to finish through the weekend,\u201d Republican Sen. Marco Rubio told Meet the Press on Sunday. \u201cIf that report would\u2019ve indicated wrongdoing or something that was actionable, there are things that could\u2019ve been done after the fact. But, you know, 48 hours to go before retirement, I would\u2019ve certainly done it differently given the fact there\u2019s still this report out there that hasn\u2019t come in.\u201d\n\nThe most impassioned defense came from McCabe himself. In a defiant statement about Sessions\u2019s decision, McCabe said he had been targeted by the president for political, and possibly illegal, reasons:\n\nHere is the reality: I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey. The release of this report was accelerated only after my testimony to the House Intelligence Committee revealed that I would corroborate former Director Comey\u2019s accounts of his discussions with the President. The OIG\u2019s focus on me and this report became a part of an unprecedented effort by the Administration, driven by the President himself, to remove me from my position, destroy my reputation, and possibly strip me of a pension that I worked 21 years to earn. The accelerated release of the report, and the punitive actions taken in response, make sense only when viewed through this lens.\n\nMcCabe might ultimately have the last word about his involvement in the Trump-Russia probe (more on that below). In the meantime, Trump\u2019s own legal team is already trying to use his firing to disrupt \u2014 and possibly terminate \u2014 the special counsel\u2019s work.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyer is pushing to end Mueller\u2019s investigation\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Preisdent Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer John Dowd.\n      \n      \n        Yana Paskova/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nWithin hours of McCabe\u2019s firing, Dowd, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, asked Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to kill the Justice Department\u2019s Russia probe. (Rosenstein has direct authority over the Mueller probe.) \n\nDowd, in an email to reporters, linked McCabe to the Russia investigation and blamed Comey for making up a case.\n\nI pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe\u2019s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt dossier.\n\nDowd had initially told the Daily Beast that he was speaking on behalf of Trump as his \u201ccounsel,\u201d only to backtrack after his statement was published and say he was actually speaking for himself. That matters because Trump has repeatedly denied that he\u2019s trying to get rid of Mueller, largely relying on Republican allies to make the case for him.\n\nDowd is a longtime Washington lawyer, having helped Senator John McCain confront the Keating Five banking scandal as far back as 1990. He joined Trump\u2019s team to combat the Mueller probe in June, taking the lead as Trump\u2019s chief outside lawyer (Trump is also represented by White House counsel Don McGahn and Ty Cobb, who handles the White House\u2019s response to Mueller\u2019s investigation).\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Dowd\u2019s comments about Mueller have sparked a political controversy . In December, Trump tweeted that he \u201chad to fire\u201d former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn because Flynn had lied to the FBI.\n\n\n\nI had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 2, 2017\n\n\n\n\nThe tweet created a headache for the White House because of the implied timing. Flynn left the White House on February 13, 2017. Trump then met with Comey the next day, and according to notes Comey took after the meeting, asked him to \u201clet Flynn go.\u201d\n\nThat would mean that Trump knew Flynn had committed a felony \u2014 lying to the FBI \u2014 when he asked Comey to drop the case, suggesting that the president tried to knowingly obstruct justice.\n\nDowd later told NBC News that he had dictated the tweet to Trump\u2019s social media director, Dan Scavino, and that Trump didn\u2019t know that Flynn had lied to federal agents.\n\nAnd Dowd also told Axios in December that Trump \u201ccannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer\u201d of the US, a claim that was heavily disputed by legal experts who spoke to Vox. Former FBI agent Asha Rangappa said that the president\u2019s position of power does not mean he can do anything he wants.\n\n\u201cThe president is not above the law, and can indeed be guilty of obstructing justice,\u201d Rangappa said.\n\nMcCabe recorded his interactions with Trump\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe\n      \n      \n        Pete Marovich/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nLordy, it looks like McCabe has memos.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, multiple news outlets reported that McCabe took notes about his interactions with Trump. We don\u2019t know what they contain. But there\u2019s at least one person who does: Mueller, because McCabe reportedly handed his notes over to the special counsel\u2019s team. Mueller\u2019s team has also reportedly interviewed McCabe and asked him questions about how Trump fired Comey.\n\nThat\u2019s potentially important because the memos can give Muller has even more insight into how Trump dealt with FBI leadership, and if at any point he attempted to end the probe. Recall that one of Comey\u2019s memos, which was initially reported by the New York Times in May 2017, said that the president encouraged Comey to drop the investigation into ousted Flynn. Comey also revealed that Trump requested a pledge a loyalty from Comey, which Comey refused to offer. \n\nMcCabe could corroborate Comey\u2019s claim that Trump tried to obstruct justice by verifying the contents of Comey\u2019s memo and recalling what Trump said to Comey. Apparently, McCabe\u2019s memos also contain information about his conversation with Comey. If McCabe tells Mueller all of this, the special counsel might have an even stronger case if he decides to take the historic step of trying to indict a sitting president.\n\nTrump, for his part, doesn\u2019t believe there are memos at all. He mentioned as much during a furious tweetstorm on Sunday, which brings us to...\n\nTrump tweets his rage\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        President Donald Trump.\n      \n      \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nOn Sunday, Washington woke to a Trump tweetstorm in which the president reiterated his claim that the Mueller investigation was a \u201cWITCH HUNT\u201d and defended the McCabe firing.\n\n\n\nThe Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s tweets included a slew of previously debunked allegations and misleading claims. \n\nTrump\u2019s tweet referenced the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court \u2014 which reviews requests from the FBI to spy on Americans when there\u2019s evidence that they might be working with a foreign government \u2014 that approved surveilling former Trump campaign aide Carter Page in October 2016. The FBI used information from a highly controversial dossier, written by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele, alleging Page met with Russian officials and that the Kremlin has compromising information on the president.\n\nRepublicans claim that the FBI didn\u2019t tell the FISA judge enough about the information, and that it was the main reason they got the warrant, while Democrats say that the FBI acted properly. They pointed to a series of meetings  between Page and a Russian intelligence operative in 2013 as one of many reasons beyond the Steele dossier that Page was of interest to investigators.  \n\nThe warrant request itself is classified, and hasn\u2019t been made public.\n\nTrump also continued to insist that there was \u201cno collusion and there was no crime\u201d associated with his campaign.\n\nWhen House Republicans closed their Russia probe on Monday they said that they had found no proof of collusion, although the Senate and Mueller team are still investigating.\n\nThere have been crimes though.\n\nFour people tied to the Trump campaign have pleaded guilty to crimes as part of the Mueller probe, while Trump\u2019s former campaign chair Paul Manafort has been indicted.\n\nThree of the four have admitted to lying to investigators. The fourth, Manafort\u2019s former right-hand man Rick Gates, also plead guilty to \u201cconspiracy against the United States.\u201d\n\nNew York Times reporter Maggie Haberman wrote that Trump\u2019s team had recently received questions from Mueller for a potential interview with Trump, which may have set the president off.\n\nTrump also used twitter to push a running argument among conservatives that Mueller\u2019s probe is biased because some of the lawyers on his team are supposedly Democrats.\n\n\n\nWhy does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThe emphasis on the political leanings of the investigators is not new. As Vox reported in December:\n\nThe attacks began over the summer when reports showed that some of Mueller\u2019s top prosecutors previously donated to Democrats. For example: James Quarles, a top lawyer on Mueller\u2019s team with experience in the Watergate case, donated thousands of dollars to the Michael Dukakis, Al Gore, John Kerry, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton campaigns. Critics said such donations meant that Quarles \u2014 and by extension the Mueller probe itself \u2014 couldn\u2019t objectively carry out the investigation.\n\nWhile Trump and other Republicans have been complaining about the political interests of Mueller\u2019s team, it\u2019s actually against the law to consider political affiliations when making decisions about who to hire, according to the FBI.\n\n\u201cFederal law and Department policy prohibit the use of political or ideological affiliations to assess applicants,\u201d an FBI report on politicization at the agency released in 2008 found. PolitiFact did its own analysis of campaign contributions by the Mueller team, and while donations skewed heavily towards democrats \u2014 $62,043 in total \u2014 Republicans did receive $2,750 from team members.\n\nThe weekend was profoundly unsettling, as Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein has argued \u201cMcCabe\u2019s firing shows how Trump has corroded the operations of the American government.\u201d It may get even worse in the coming days, especially if the president is winding up to try to remove Mueller.\n\nWright, the current law professor and former White House lawyer, told Vox he\u2019s worried about what\u2019s yet to come for one startling reason: \u201cThe president of the United States is unhinged.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Rachel Wolfe", "body": "President Trump ignoring an explicit warning from advisers on a tricky foreign policy topic is nothing new \u2014 but on Tuesday, Trump took it to a new level in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. \n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Trump either didn\u2019t read or chose to ignore a section in his briefing materials that said, bluntly, \u201cDO NOT CONGRATULATE\u201d Putin on his election victory \u2014 and went ahead and did it immediately anyway:\n\nIt was not clear whether Trump read the notes, administration officials said. Trump, who initiated the call, opened it with the congratulations for Putin, one person familiar with the conversation said.\n\nTrump defended his actions Wednesday afternoon in a tweet that lambasted the \u201cFake News Media\u201d and concluded that \u201cgetting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.\u201d  \n\n\n\nI called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.......\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 21, 2018\n\n\n\n\nWhy Trump\u2019s advisers didn\u2019t want him to congratulate Putin\nWhile it\u2019s fairly routine for world leaders to congratulate one another on electoral victories, the news media is right to point out that the Russian election wasn\u2019t exactly a shining example of democracy. Putin\u2019s most prominent opponent wasn\u2019t on the ballot, and the Associated Press reported on voting irregularities. \n\nAs Trump pointed out in his tweet, President Obama also congratulated Putin when he ran in a similarly unfair election in 2012, to a chorus of criticism from Republicans. Still, given that Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia has been a source of skepticism throughout his tenure as president \u2014 and considering the ongoing investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia \u2014 the phone call is another reminder of the president\u2019s friendly attitude toward Putin. \n\nTrump later described the conversation \u2014 which spanned topics including arms control and security in North Korea and Syria, but not the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy and his daughter in Great Britain \u2014 as a \u201cvery good call,\u201d according to the Post\u2019s Carol D. Leonnig, David Nakamura, and Josh Dawsey.\n\nBeyond Trump\u2019s remarks to Putin, the Washington Post report shows leaks are still coming from the White House \u2014 in this case, a close adviser went behind the president\u2019s back to talk to the press hours after he hung up the phone. \n\nIt suggests dysfunction so deep that advisers believe stirring up a controversy is potentially more effective at changing the president\u2019s behavior than talking to him, as Nicolle Wallace, who served as White House communications director for President George W. Bush, suggested on Twitter (in conversation with another Bush official, Ari Fleischer):\n\n\n\nWe both know a lot about leaks. Without getting into the merits, (because we likely disagree and Twitter isn\u2019t the place for civil disagreement) can we agree that it was probably someone who was worried that he congratulated Putin and didn\u2019t condemn Russia\u2019s actions in the UK? https://t.co/qwxGFpORDk\n\u2014 Nicolle Wallace (@NicolleDWallace) March 21, 2018\n\n\n\n\nTrump is reportedly furious about the leak and asking his outside advisers who they thought had leaked the information, according to CNN. \n\nThe Washington Post scoop inspired something of an internet moment, as dumbfounded Americans joked about a president who clearly does not know how to listen. \n\nA moment meant to be memed\nTwitter users wasted no time mocking the moment Tuesday night, comparing the call to other infamous scenarios of people not following advice or instructions.\n\nSome tweets compared the call to the ubiquitous \u201cbad pets\u201d pictures \u2014 in which dogs and cats pose innocently with a mess they\u2019ve created.\n\n\nOthers saw similarities to Vice President Mike Pence infamously touching an object with a \u201cDo Not Touch\u201d sign placed across it and Trump looking directly into the sun during the eclipse.\n\n\nThere was a callback to the Oscars in 2017:\n\n\nA new hat for Trump:\n\n\nAnd finally, it\u2019s not a Trump-Russia story without a Simpsons reference.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Ella Nilsen", "body": "Wednesday was a very good day for Democrats and a catastrophic day for Republicans, as Democrat Conor Lamb narrowly edged a win over Republican Rick Saccone in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District. \n\nThe race stretched into Wednesday midday when CNN said Lamb was in the lead by 627 votes with 100 percent of precincts reporting. State law does not mandate a recount in district-level elections. Unless Republicans can successfully challenge him, that means Lamb just pulled off a stunning upset in a district Democrats hadn\u2019t won in more than 10 years.\n\nLamb declared victory early Wednesday morning, introduced as \u201cCongressman-elect\u201d to his crowd of supporters as he took the stage.\n\n\u201cIt took a little longer than we thought, but we did it!\u201d he told them.\n\nLamb\u2019s win has seismic political implications for 2018 and changes what Democrats thought was possible going into a crucial election year. It also says a lot about what messages will and won\u2019t resonate with voters in so-called \u201cTrump country\u201d districts.\n\nWinner: Democratic enthusiasm \nPennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District is a huge win for Democrats. They weren\u2019t just reclaiming territory they had lost to Trump, they were able to push into new, solidly red territory that Republicans had held since 2003. It\u2019s a continuation of the momentum they\u2019ve been building on in special elections throughout 2017, most notably with Sen. Doug Jones winning the special senate race in Alabama \u2014 the first Democrat to do so in 25 years.\n\nJust like with Alabama, it\u2019s worth reminding people that Democrats didn\u2019t even think they could compete in this Pennsylvania district a few months ago. But they had the right candidate, a 33-year-old veteran and federal prosecutor named Conor Lamb. \n\nThe district has Democratic roots; there are technically 70,000 more registered Democrats in the 18th Congressional District than Republicans, but many of those voters have been casting ballots for GOP candidates for years. It\u2019s probably more accurate to think of it as an economic populist district rather than strongly conservative. \n\nIt\u2019s also heavy union territory (a huge demographic for Trump in 2016). Lamb was able to strike the right balance with pro-gun views and moderate messaging on abortion. He is very pro-union, while his Republican opponent Rick Saccone was vehemently anti-union.\n\nSince Trump trounced Hillary Clinton in Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan in 2016, he was able to spin the narrative that the Rust Belt was \u201cTrump country.\u201d But Lamb\u2019s victory turns that on its head. Lamb didn\u2019t make the race about Trump, but he actually ran on many of the same issues Trump did: preserving Medicare and Social Security, fighting the opioid crisis, and protecting pensions for the area\u2019s coal miners. \n\nEspecially as Trump\u2019s administration breaks with many of his 2016 campaign promises (proposing vast cuts to Medicare and doing little to solve America\u2019s drug problem), Democrats will definitely try to replicate Lamb\u2019s playbook to pick up more Rust Belt districts during the 2018 midterms.\n\nWinner: Pro-gun Democrats\nLamb portrayed himself as an independent, moderate Democrat from the beginning, including on the gun issue. In fact, Lamb\u2019s first campaign ad featured footage of him shooting an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle at a gun range, with the narrator voiceover saying the candidate \u201cstill loves to shoot.\u201d\n\nThroughout the campaign, Republicans furiously tried to attack Lamb on the gun issue, painting him as a candidate who would pursue aggressive gun control policies as soon as he got to Washington. But that goes against what Lamb was actually saying. A US Marine Corps veteran, he supports improving the existing background check system but is on the record as not supporting new gun control measures.\n\nBut that\u2019s putting the Democratic Party in a tricky position amid a fresh wave of anti-gun activism led by student survivors of the Parkland, Florida, shooting last month. On Wednesday, thousands of high students staged nationwide walk-outs and protests demanding Congress pass new gun control laws to stop mass shootings. Many Democratic members of Congress joined them in a show of solidarity.\n\n\nAs Democrats try to win back the House in 2018, they\u2019re going to need candidates like Lamb in the mix. More Democratic 2018 candidates are explicitly campaigning on gun control as an issue they believe can win them elections. Lamb\u2019s win could change that calculus in redder districts.\n\nThe big picture is that if Democrats can pull off a decisive win in 2018 and take back Congressional majorities, they could be in a position to vote on gun legislation \u2014 whether it\u2019s strengthening background checks or calling for a full-on assault weapons ban. Who makes up the caucus will determine what kind of legislation gets voted on.\n\nWinner: Pennsylvania redistricting\nWith the amount of national attention and money thrown into this race, it was easy to forget that we all get to do this again in November ... by which time PA-18 will be a completely different district.\n\nThat\u2019s because a few weeks ago, Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that the state\u2019s congressional map Republicans drew in 2010 was unconstitutionally partisan. After some back and forth between the Republican-controlled state legislature and Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, the duty to redraw the maps was kicked back to the state Supreme Court, which released a new map a few weeks ago.\n\nHere\u2019s the old map. PA-18 is the district in the bottom left-hand corner.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Wikipedia\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nAnd here\u2019s the new map. If you notice, PA-18 and PA-14 have essentially switched places (among other changes). The biggest change is that PA-18 will contain much more of liberal Pittsburgh and less of the conservative counties that kept the district represented by Republicans for 15 years. It will go from being a Republican stronghold (that a Democrat just won) to a swing district.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Wikipedia\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThe new map has cleaner lines, splits fewer counties, and will likely lead to many more competitive elections. This is certainly better for Democrats, but due to the degree the state was gerrymandered to benefit Republicans, it\u2019s more accurate to think of this redrawing as leveling out the balance rather than a Democratic gerrymander. \n\nThe 18th District was drawn to keep a Democrat from winning it, but Lamb did it anyways. Pennsylvania Republicans are challenging the new map. But if it stays, Lamb likely will breeze through his November race with a much more favorable district.\n\nLoser: President Donald Trump\nTrump really, really cared about Republicans winning PA-18, a district that was solid \u201cTrump country.\u201d (He won it by 20 points in 2016.) And Saccone tried to style himself as a Trump-like candidate, declaring himself \u201cTrump before Trump was Trump.\u201d \n\nTrump cared enough about Saccone getting the seat to join the Republican candidate on the campaign trail multiple times, as well as sending Vice President Mike Pence and members of his family. Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump both stumped for Saccone around the district. Trump even pushed a controversial announcement on steel and aluminum import tariffs to land a week before the special election. (Polling by Monmouth University found tariffs barely registered before Election Day.) \n\nRepublicans and conservative groups poured a deluge of cash into the PA-18 race so they wouldn\u2019t embarrass themselves by losing a district that they had easily hung onto for more than a decade. But for Trump, the impetus was much more personal. \n\nTrump\u2019s push wasn\u2019t about Saccone, it was about hanging onto \u201cTrump country\u201d in Southwestern Pennsylvania \u2014 and with it, the very narrative about Rust Belt voters that put him in the White House. Lamb\u2019s win was a huge blow to that narrative, and likely \u2014 for a president who cares so much about loyalty \u2014 Trump\u2019s pride.\n\nLoser: GOP tax cuts (reform)\n\nCongressional Republicans insisted their tax cuts would help them win elections. That didn\u2019t work out in PA-18, a working-class district that should have been the model for tax cut success.\n\nAt first, Republicans went all in on their tax cut messaging. For weeks, the bill was the subject of countless ads and consumed Saccone\u2019s talking points on the trail. Trump even came to the state for a conveniently located GOP tax rally in Western Pennsylvania in January, which the White House insisted was not directly related to Saccone\u2019s candidacy.\n\nThat didn\u2019t last, but it\u2019s not necessarily because the tax bill is unpopular \u2014 it\u2019s more that there\u2019s just too many other things going on and it\u2019s tough for voters to stay focused. Since Republican passed the tax bill in December, it has generally grown in popularity \u2014 but in Pennsylvania, it wasn\u2019t enough to secure Saccone a stable lead in the polls.\n\nAt the beginning of February, almost two-thirds of GOP ads were about the Republican tax law, according to a Politico analysis. By election day, the same groups had pivoted sharply to decrying so-called sanctuary cities, as Politico reported:\n\nSince the beginning of March, tax ads have been essentially non-existent. Only two are on the air now \u2014 one from the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action which briefly mentions the tax law, and a radio ad from a progressive group attacking Saccone for supporting the law.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Republicans are going to stop messaging on taxes for the 2018 midterms. They were all but doubling down during a GOP press conference on Capitol Hill Wednesday.\n\n\n\n.@cathymcmorris starts off the GOP press conference today with a comment on Pennsylvania: says it\u2019s important not to make \u201csweeping predictions\u201d and that we\u2019re \u201cnot even in full momentum on tax reform\u201d\n\u2014 Tara Golshan (@taragolshan) March 14, 2018\n\n\n\n\nLoser: Egregious campaign spending\nImagine you had $7 million. Now imagine taking a match and lighting that $7 million on fire. That\u2019s essentially what Republicans did in PA-18. \n\nRepublicans and conservative-allied groups heavily outspent the Democrats throughout the race, even though Lamb outraised Saccone by a substantial amount. After Saccone\u2019s campaign showed a lackluster fundraising effort, outside Republican groups \u2014 including the national campaign arm for House Republicans \u2014 jumped in to get Saccone over the finish line.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, as of February 27, Saccone\u2019s campaign and allied groups had spent a total of $9.1 million on the race, between the Congressional Leadership Fund, the National Republican Congressional Committee, and others. Meanwhile, Democratic groups and labor unions had spent less than $1 million.\n\nThe official campaign arm for House Republicans reported spending another $619,664 on media ahead of the March 13 election for Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District House seat, bringing the total to $3.5 million on media buys as of last week in a last-minute panic.\n\nAnd even if Republicans had been successful in this last-minute cash push, it\u2019s important to remember that the winner will hold onto the seat for less than a year and the race\u2019s outcome didn\u2019t determine the control the House of Representatives. The sheer amount of spending was, largely, pointless. \n\nGiven that they weren\u2019t successful, the GOP may be forced to reconsider its messaging and recruitment. Clearly, money didn\u2019t get them very far in this race.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Joseph Blocher", "body": "The great American gun debate has long been conducted at the national level \u2014 as we will see, once again, at Saturday\u2019s March for Our Lives event in Washington, DC \u2014 but in many ways it is also deeply rooted in local experiences. \n\nIndeed, the touchstones of the debate are a series of place names. Columbine. Sandy Hook. San Bernardino. Aurora. Orlando. Las Vegas. Each of the attacks that occurred in those towns and cities triggered waves of discussion about how regulation might reduce the tens of thousands of shootings that occur in the United States every year. But those waves crashed and receded, and federal law remains fundamentally unchanged.\n\nThe Parkland mass shooting has set off another wave. There is some reason to believe that it will end differently than the others \u2014 that there will be marginal steps toward gun regulations, perhaps including limitations on high capacity magazines, a ban on \u201cbump stocks\u201d (which allow semiautomatic weapons to fire more rapidly), and restrictions on sales to minors. \n\nBut hopes were high in the wake of Sandy Hook, too, and Congress basically did nothing. How can supporters of reasonable gun regulation avoid similar disappointment this time around? \n\nOne partial solution is to look for answers closer to home. If we are stalemated at the national level, might we pursue gun regulations tailored to local experiences, preferences, and needs? Thoughtful policy suggests, and our traditions and Constitution support, this kind of \u201cfirearm localism.\u201d It could help us find a way out of the current policy impasse. \n\nWhy localism?\nA basic goal of regulation is to maximize public safety while minimizing costs to individual liberty, and one way to do that is by tailoring rules to places or situations where they\u2019re likely to do the most good. When it comes to guns, that often means drawing distinctions between urban and rural areas.\n\nGun violence is disproportionately concentrated in densely populated areas. Roughly 60 percent of American gun homicides occur in the nation\u2019s 50 largest metro areas. In Connecticut, for example, 67 percent of gun homicides occur in just three cities, which together account for just 11 percent of the state\u2019s population. \n\nOn the flip side, the benefits of gun use are disproportionately rural. People in rural areas are far more likely to grow up with guns, and to use them for hunting and recreation. They might also face longer police response times, and so feel an increased need for a firearm in the home as a matter of personal safety. \n\nA deadly exception to the overall cost-benefits calculation is suicide. Self-killing, which accounts for most gun deaths, is a disproportionately rural phenomenon, and until recently has been largely ignored in public discussions about guns. That seems to be changing, at least to some degree. Even so, the types of responses and regulations that might help address gun suicides \u2014 including the push for \u201cfirearm choice\u201d laws (which allow people to put themselves, voluntarily, on \u201cdo not sell-to\u201d lists) \u2014 are very different than those relevant to the problem of homicides in urban areas.\n\nGiven these different experiences, it\u2019s unsurprising that supporters of stricter gun regulation tend to be highly concentrated in cities and relatively rare in rural areas, and also that advocates and opponents of such regulation sound (and feel) as if they\u2019re talking to across deep cultural divides. Even in gun-friendly states like Texas, the differences can be stark, with urban poll respondents nearly twice as likely to say they favor stricter gun laws.\n\nPooling the preferences of urban and rural areas leads to less overall satisfaction than more local approaches. Pitting those preferences against each other isn\u2019t always necessary, let alone productive. A more localized approach could satisfy the preferences of more people without necessarily increasing the total amount of regulation. \n\nTo slightly modify a thought experiment used by the Stanford law professor (and former federal judge) Michael McConnell: Consider two jurisdictions, urban place A and rural locale B. Each is deciding whether to pass a particular gun regulation, and each has 100 residents. \n\nIn the urban area A, 70 people support the regulation; in rural area B, 40 do. \n\nIf they are required to reach a decision collectively, the regulation will pass and 110 people will be satisfied. But if they can choose for themselves, A will regulate, B will not, and 130 people will be satisfied. \n\nOur forebears understood this calculus. American gun laws have historically been tailored to local conditions. In the era of our nation\u2019s founding, regulations in major cities like Boston and New York effectively made it impossible for people to keep loaded guns in their homes, even as those living outside the city limits could and did rely on guns for hunting and self-protection. \n\nAs the nation expanded westward, the urban-rural division went with it. Even the cow towns of the supposedly wild West had gun laws far more strict than those found in any American jurisdiction today. In places like Dodge City, Kansas, and Tombstone, Arizona, people were required to check their guns at the city limits. (The famed shootout at the OK Corral was sparked in part by the Earp brothers\u2019 attempt to disarm members of the Cowboys gang, who were violating Tombstone\u2019s gun ordinance.)\n\nAll of this raises the question: If firearm localism makes sense as a policy matter, tracks political preferences, and is consistent with American history and tradition, why isn\u2019t the debate more focused on local solutions?\n\nHow the Second Amendment affects the argument for varying laws by locale\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller said most \u201clongstanding\u201d gun laws were \u201cpresumptively\u201d constitutional. Cities have historically had tighter gun laws than rural towns.\n      \n      \n        Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nOf course, there\u2019s a constitutional constraint on local variation: the right to keep and bear arms guaranteed by the Second Amendment. That right, as interpreted in binding Supreme Court precedent, forbids sweeping gun regulations. In fact, the Court\u2019s two major Second Amendment decisions, District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) and McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010), struck down municipal handgun bans. \n\nAnd yet the Second Amendment is not incompatible with firearm localism (as I have argued elsewhere, at greater length). For one thing, the vast majority of politically plausible gun regulations raise no serious Second Amendment questions. The kinds of state or local laws that might emerge from the current wave of the gun debate, such as age restrictions, limitations on high capacity magazines, even bans on \u201cassault weapons\u201d (however defined), are overwhelmingly likely to be deemed constitutional by the courts. \n\nEven Justice Scalia\u2019s landmark opinion in Heller, which held that the right to keep and bear arms includes certain private purposes like self-defense against crime \u2014 and not only collective defense of the sort that a state militia provides \u2014 did not rule out such restrictions. Justice Scalia wrote that \u201clongstanding\u201d gun laws were \u201cpresumptively\u201d constitutional, referring to laws banning \u201cdangerous and unusual weapons.\u201d \n\nSince Heller, more than 1,000 Second Amendment challenges have been filed, and more than 90 percent of the challenges have failed. Many of those challenges involved the kinds of longstanding gun laws that Scalia had in mind. But it\u2019s also the case that no feature of American gun regulation is more longstanding than the stricter regulation of guns in cities.\n\nThere is also no reason to think cities are eager to push beyond what the Constitution is currently held to permit. Note that even when the Supreme Court allowed handgun bans, DC and Chicago were the only two major cities to adopt them. \n\nIn any event, cities cannot exempt themselves from the Second Amendment. Federal constitutional rights are national rights for a reason. But the precise contours of those rights vary from place to place. No one doubts that freedom of speech is a nationwide right, for example, but what counts as \u201cobscenity,\u201d and therefore lacks constitutional coverage, is defined in part by community standards. \n\nThe due process clauses protect property as a matter of federal constitutional law, but state law defines what counts as property in the first place. Gun rights might be subject to the same kind of at-the-margins tailoring. \n\nThat leaves the most serious legal obstacle to firearm localism: the widespread, and relatively recent, adoption by state legislatures of \u201cpreemption\u201d laws that limit or outright forbid municipal gun control. Thanks in part to an NRA-supported push beginning in the 1980s, more than 42 states have enacted broad firearm preemption laws. These laws are a far more significant impediment to local regulation, and to gun regulation more generally, than the Second Amendment. Their effect has been to force cities to have the same generally permissive rules as rural areas do. \n\nBroad preemption laws prevent carefully tailored gun policy, they limit community self-governance, they break from longstanding American tradition, and they make compromise even harder in a debate in which common ground already seems hard to find. They should be repealed or revised to permit the kinds of local solutions suggested by policy, politics, tradition, and the Constitution.\n\nNational crises lead many people to look to Washington for solutions. That\u2019s not always the best course.\nThinking about firearms localism requires a shift in mindset. As with many other regulatory issues, some people instinctively look to the federal government for answers. Democrats, who are far more likely to support both gun regulation and federal action, may be particularly susceptible to this reflex. And, to be fair, there are some kinds of gun regulation, including background checks and manufacturing requirements, that depend on a degree of national uniformity. \n\nBut, practically speaking, many bread-and-butter regulations can be passed and enforced at the local level. Permit requirements for public carrying, bans on particular kinds of weaponry and equipment (high-capacity magazines or assault weapons, say), age restrictions, and so on can be jurisdiction-specific and enforced locally without the need for nationwide coordination.\n\nOf course, regulatory choices in other jurisdictions might blunt the effectiveness of these local rules. New York\u2019s comparatively stringent gun laws are partially undermined by the \u201cIron Pipeline\u201d through which guns flow from gun-friendly states like Virginia and North Carolina. \n\nBut those kinds of spillover effects simply create a practical limitation on the effectiveness of local tailoring; they aren\u2019t an argument against it. Moreover, some policies are not as susceptible to externalities. A ban on open carrying in New York City can be enforced on the spot regardless of what North Carolina chooses to do.  \n\nGun rights supporters have often succeeded by thinking two steps ahead: Not just winning particular battles, but establishing favorable terrain on which to fight \u2014 and the passage of the preemption laws is a perfect example. \n\nAdvocates of reasonable gun regulation can do the same. And the strongest terrain, it turns out, may be close to home.\n\nJoseph Blocher is a professor at Duke Law School, and the author of the Yale Law Journal article \u201cFirearm Localism\u201d \n\n\nThe Big Idea is Vox\u2019s home for smart discussion of the most important issues and ideas in politics, science, and culture \u2014 typically by outside contributors.

Over in House District 144, Democrats took a relatively narrow 53-47 loss in a district that Trump carried by 59 points. The other two GOP holds in Missouri also had large swings, with Democrats outperforming Hillary Clinton by 18 points in one race and by 25 points in another. \nThis is the second state legislative seat Democrats flipped in 2018 after a state Senate race in Wisconsin a couple of weeks ago, and it marks a larger trend of very strong Democratic results in state legislative races.\nDemocrats are cleaning up in special elections\nAccording to an extremely useful comprehensive spreadsheet compiled by Daily Kos, across 70 special elections in 2017, Democrats ran 10 points ahead of Clinton and 7 points ahead of Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 results.

Gen. H.R. McMaster began his tenure as national security adviser as one of the most celebrated military leaders of his generation. But President Donald Trump just fired him after just over a year in the administration \u2014 leaving McMaster\u2019s once-sterling reputation in tatters and the White House in even more disarray.\n\nIn a tweet, Trump announced that McMaster would make way for former UN Ambassador John Bolton, but that McMaster \u201cwill always remain my friend.\u201d\n\nOn March 15, the Washington Post reported that Trump decided to oust McMaster, but didn\u2019t do so because he wanted to ensure there was a prominent successor in place and that McMaster has his next job lined up. But now Trump finally followed through.\n\nMcMaster follows closely behind Rex Tillerson, who Trump fired on March 13. Hours after Tillerson\u2019s removal, McMaster told a reporter \u201cHey, I\u2019m still around.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to end this way. McMaster \u2014 along with Defense Secretary James Mattis and, at the time, Tillerson \u2014 was labeled an \u201cadult\u201d in the room whose military and strategic expertise would help him gain Trump\u2019s trust and moderate the president\u2019s most potentially dangerous foreign policy impulses. \n\nInstead, McMaster soon found himself at odds with both the president and other top administration officials. Trump, for example, pushed back hard against McMaster on crucial national security decisions, particularly the decision to escalate the war in Afghanistan. \n\nTrump also publicly lambasted McMaster for saying that the evidence Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election was \u201cincontrovertible\u201d \u2014 a fact the president repeatedly denies. And McMaster also advocated for a more militaristic stance toward North Korea, consistently warning that time was running out before a potential war with Pyongyang.\n\nBut McMaster perhaps struggled most simply dealing with Trump. A National Security Council (NSC) staffer who worked with McMaster and is not authorized to speak publicly about internal matters told me that no policy decision Trump took was ever final until it was actually implemented. \n\nIn other words, it was hard for McMaster and his team to put a policy into place because the president\u2019s wishes sometimes changed on a dime. That, in part, made it difficult for McMaster to simply do his job.\n\nPlus, according to the Post, Trump didn\u2019t like McMaster\u2019s style: \u201cThe president has complained that McMaster is too rigid and that his briefings go on too long and seem irrelevant.\u201d \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that if another person was occupying the position right now, that they\u2019d be doing a markedly better job,\u201d Jake Sullivan, who was considered a lock to be Hillary Clinton\u2019s national security adviser had she won the election, told me before the firing announcement.\n\nTrump\u2019s personal flaws aside, McMaster made errors of his own. For example, he publicly offered a widely scrutinized non-denial denial that Trump shared classified intelligence with Russians in the Oval Office.\n\nSo an Iraq War veteran who famously wrote that military advisers should speak truth to power and act honorably \u2014 especially when it was hard \u2014 lasted about a year in the Trump White House. Worse still, McMaster\u2019s hard-earned reputation will be irreparably damaged by his association with Trump.\n\n\u201cWith the possible exception of Henry Kissinger holding the NSC together while Nixon was flailing during Watergate, it would be hard to imagine a genuinely successful national security adviser with a failing president,\u201d William Inboden, a top NSC staffer in the George W. Bush administration, told me. \u201cThe fate of the two are so linked.\u201d\n\nMcMaster wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s first pick\nMcMaster was not Trump\u2019s first choice to be national security adviser. That was Michael Flynn, a retired three-star Army general who strongly supported Trump during the campaign. But after only 24 days in the role, Trump fired Flynn because he lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his communications with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak after the election \u2014 a personnel move Trump still regrets having to make. \n\n(Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election.)\n\nTrump then tried to lure retired Navy Vice Adm. Robert Harward, a Lockheed Martin executive, to take Flynn\u2019s place. But Harward turned the offer down because the White House wouldn\u2019t let him put his own team together. So the search continued until Trump heeded the advice of Armed Services Committee Chair Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK), and Mattis, who all said the president should pick McMaster.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man of tremendous talent and tremendous experience,\u201d Trump said during the unveiling of McMaster as his new national security adviser on February 20, 2017. \u201cI watched and read a lot over the last two days. He is highly respected by everyone in the military, and we\u2019re very honored to have him.\u201d\n\n\nMcMaster was one of the few Trump appointments to draw praise from Democrats and Republicans alike. Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI), the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said McMaster had \u201ca reputation for courage and candor.\u201d Bill Kristol, a conservative critic of the administration, tweeted \u201cI can't imagine anyone better prepared for the challenges of being Trump's NSA than H.R. McMaster.\u201d Michael McFaul, a former ambassador to Russia under President Barack Obama, tweeted \u201cI have a lot of respect for H.R.\u201d\n\nThe acclaim stemmed, in part, from McMaster\u2019s image as a warrior-scholar. McMaster\u2019s only book, Dereliction of Duty, is a bestselling history on the Vietnam War which concludes that President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s military advisers should have pushed the administration harder to adopt their assessments and recommendations for the conflict. Had Johnson listened to them, McMaster argues, America might have done better in Southeast Asia. \u201cThe war in Vietnam was not lost in the field, nor was it lost on the front pages of the New York Times or the college campuses,\u201d McMaster wrote. \u201cIt was lost in Washington, DC.\u201d \n\nMany inside and outside the White House expected that McMaster would get the National Security Council in order, work closely with other cabinet members like Mattis and Tillerson, and offer his unvarnished military advice to the president. \n\nEarly on, at least, McMaster offered some reasons for optimism. On April 5, 2017, just over a month into the job, he removed former top Trump aide Steve Bannon from the NSC \u2014 political aides haven\u2019t historically been allowed to attend \u2014 and returned Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford to their historic roles as \u201cregular attendees\u201d of the gatherings.\n\nThe next day, Trump authorized a Tomahawk missile strike against a Syrian base that Bashar al-Assad had used to mount a chemical weapons attack against his own citizens; McMaster helped guide the decision-making process, which was widely-praised. He also removed some of Flynn\u2019s staff holdovers, most notably his then-deputy K.T. McFarland, who had drawn criticism for inexperience and acting as a partisan in a famously apolitical role.\n\nBut by May, internal squabbles started to play out in public. The biggest problem was McMaster recommended Trump send more troops to Afghanistan \u2014 advice that initially rankled many in the White House, most notably Trump himself.\n\nTrump and McMaster didn\u2019t see eye to eye on most things\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        US President Donald Trump (L) and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster (R) walk on the South Lawn prior to a Marine One departure from the White House June 16, 2017 in Washington, DC.\n      \n      \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nDuring a mid-July meeting, McMaster put forward a plan to send up to 3,900 new US troops to bolster the Afghan government in its flagging fight against the Taliban (at the time, there were about 8,400 American troops already in the country).\n\nThe meeting was a \u201cshitshow,\u201d according to a July 24, 2017 Politico report, as Trump rejected McMaster\u2019s plan and \u201cwords were exchanged.\u201d The president was wary of spending more blood and treasure in Afghanistan, especially when the US had lost around 2,400 troops and civilians since the war began in October 2001 and failed to deal a body blow to the Taliban. The extremist group controls, influences, or contests more than 40 percent of the country.\n\nMcMaster\u2019s enemies in the administration, at the time led by Bannon, took advantage of Trump\u2019s displeasure with McMaster\u2019s Afghanistan proposal. They mockingly dubbed the fight in Central Asia as \u201cMcMaster\u2019s War\u201d, and ruthlessly attacked the national security adviser during the Afghanistan debate to ruin his standing with the president.\n\n\u201cOn policy, the faction of the White House loyal to senior strategist Steve Bannon is convinced McMaster is trying to trick the president into the kind of nation building that Trump campaigned against,\u201d Bloomberg View\u2019s Eli Lake wrote on May 8, 2017.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubting that Trump was reluctant to deepen America\u2019s involvement in what was already the longest war in US history. But on August 21, 2017, Trump took McMaster\u2019s advice and ordered more US troops to Afghanistan \u2014 even though it went against his initial beliefs.\n\n\u201cMy original instinct was to pull out \u2014 and, historically, I like following my instincts,\u201d Trump told a military crowd at Fort Myer, which is near Arlington Cemetery. \u201cBut all my life I\u2019ve heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office; in other words, when you\u2019re president of the United States.\u201d\n\nAfghanistan wasn\u2019t the only time Trump and McMaster were at odds. Last May, Trump said that South Korea would have to pay for the THAAD missile defense system, which Seoul wants to protect itself from North Korea\u2019s ever-improving missile and nuclear programs. Trump promptly screamed at McMaster over the phone for contradicting him.\n\nTrump was also expected to use a speech at NATO\u2019s headquarters on May 25, 2017 to specifically endorse the alliance\u2019s article 5 provision, which calls for collective defense and says that an attack on any NATO nation is considered to be an attack on all of them. In advance of the speech, McMaster expected Trump to read language underscoring America\u2019s support for article 5. Instead, Trump omitted those 27 words, sparking new doubts about his commitment to the military alliance.\n\nTrump also met with Russian President Vladimir Putin during last July\u2019s G20 meeting in Hamburg, Germany, despite McMaster\u2019s objections. While national security advisers usually attend those bilaterals, only Tillerson accompanied Trump. \n\nAnd in February 2018, McMaster told an audience at the Munich Security Conference that Russia had meddled in the 2016 presidential election. \u201cThe evidence is now really incontrovertible and available in the public domain, whereas in the past it was difficult to attribute,\u201d McMaster said in his remarks. \n\nTrump quickly tweeted his displeasure with the comments, stating that \u201cGeneral McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians.\u201d\n\n\n\nGeneral McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nIt also didn\u2019t help that the three-star\u2019s persistent chatter during meetings annoyed Trump, according to the New York Times last May. During some of them, McMaster tried to correct or add color to what the president was saying \u2014 with Trump right there. \n\nMcMaster did have some successes, however. Besides the Syria strike, McMaster helped to guide Trump\u2019s thinking about North Korea. The three-star believed the US could not deter North Korean leader Kim Jong Un from continuing to expand his nuclear weapons program, and argued that the chance for war grew with each passing day. \u201cWe\u2019re in a race, really, to able to solve this problem,\u201d McMaster said during the last December\u2019s Reagan National Defense Forum.\n\nMcMaster argued that the only way to change Kim\u2019s mind was with the threat \u2014 and possible use \u2014 of military force. For months, rumors swirled that the administration had developed a plan for a so-called \u201cbloody nose\u201d strike. The plan was widely viewed as McMaster\u2019s brainchild, although top officials deny that a \u201cbloody nose\u201d strike was ever an option.\n\nBut if the administration chooses to move forward with any military moves against North Korea, it will do so without McMaster in the White House.\n\n\u201cMcMaster couldn\u2019t keep riding the tiger\u201d\n\nNo one questions McMaster\u2019s intellect. The problem was he always seemed out of his depths as Trump\u2019s top national security adviser. After all, he spent his life in the military and not much time dealing with Washington politics.\n\nAfter Trump shared highly sensitive intelligence about an ISIS plot with top Russian officials on May 10, 2017, McMaster twice publicly defended the president\u2019s actions. He didn\u2019t deny that Trump had actually given that intelligence to an adversary and possibly put an Israeli spy \u2014 who was reportedly deep under cover in an ISIS cell \u2014 in danger.\n\nInstead, McMaster claimed what Trump did was \u201cwholly appropriate\u201d and even acknowledged that Trump didn\u2019t know where the intelligence he shared came from. That\u2019s not something a seasoned political hand says to explain away why the president made a potentially costly mistake. \n\nMcMaster later spoke during a June 28 Center for a New American Security conference in a keynote address. Trying to defend Trump\u2019s foreign policy is tough enough.

His co-author was Gary Cohn, Trump\u2019s then-top economic adviser, who resigned earlier this month.\n\nThe two men defended the president\u2019s first foreign trip to the Middle East and Europe in the Wall Street Journal on May 30, 2017, claiming Trump\u2019s presence and actions showed just how willing America wanted to work with allies and partners. That was the same trip where Trump refused to commit to NATO\u2019s article 5, alarming key US allies around the world.\n\nAnd in the July 13, 2017 New York Times piece, they argued America\u2019s foreign policy was going well, and that Trump got what he wanted out of the G20 meetings. But that\u2019s not how many who tuned into the gathering saw it. Putin outplayed Trump when the Russian leader got the president to accept his narrative that Moscow didn\u2019t interfere in the election. The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, even called it a \u201cdiplomatic depantsing.\u201d\n\nSo while serving Trump is surely difficult, understanding McMaster\u2019s downfall would be incomplete without noting that the general \u2014 as talented as he is \u2014 made some critical mistakes along the way.\n\n\u201cUnless an adviser\u2019s policy recommendations and administrative style coincide with the president\u2019s own immediate emotions and interests, there is great potential for conflict,\u201d Bartholomew Sparrow, who wrote a book about former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, told me. \u201cThere was an accumulation of serious differences in substance and process to make the relationship unsustainable. McMaster couldn\u2019t keep riding the tiger.\u201d \n\nMcMaster\u2019s time as national security adviser may not have amounted to a dereliction of duty, but the general definitely didn\u2019t meet the standards he had set for others.

McCabe said the vindictive act was the result of the role he played in the aftermath of former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s departure, who also infamously kept memos about his interactions with Trump. McCabe added that the president\u2019s directive was an effort to slander him as well as to \u201ctaint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally.\u201d McCabe, who turns 50 on Sunday, stepped down as deputy director of the FBI in January but hadn\u2019t planned to formally retire until March 18th, his 50th birthday. \n\nMcCabe kept memos similar to the ones maintained by Comey, according to the Associated Press, citing a person with direct knowledge of the situation. The memos reportedly include details of interactions with the president and other topics, and it\u2019s not clear if any have been turned over to or requested by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nComey told the Senate Intelligence Committee last June he kept memos about his interactions with Trump because he was worried the president would lie about them. One of the memos, which was initially reported by the New York Times in May 2017, said that the president encouraged Comey to drop the investigation into ousted National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. A federal judge in February rejected requests from news organizations to obtain all of Comey\u2019s memos. \n\nMcCabe\u2019s firing isn\u2019t supposed to be political, but it looks anything but.\nThe controversy around McCabe stems in part from yet-to-be-released findings by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general; the case alleges that McCabe misled investigators about allowing two top FBI officials to talk to reporters about his decision to open a case into the Clinton Foundation. But Trump and Republicans have for months attacked McCabe over what they say are his wife\u2019s compromising political ties to Hillary Clinton.

Those funds go toward things like US scholarships for promising foreign students, in hopes they develop a closer bond with the US through their study. \nTrump\u2019s budget proposal is unlikely to become a reality. But its radical rejection of the State Department\u2019s mission is useful for understanding the White House\u2019s foreign policy priorities.

USCIS, the federal agency responsible for issuing visas and green cards and for naturalizing immigrants as US citizens, has unveiled a new mission statement that strips out all references to immigrants themselves \u2014 including taking out a line that called the US a \u201cnation of immigrants.\u201d And in an email to agency staff Thursday, as first reported by the Intercept\u2019s Ryan Devereaux, director L. Francis Cissna bragged about the change \u2014 saying that USCIS wasn\u2019t supposed to help immigrants and the US citizens seeking to sponsor them, but rather \u201cthe American people.\u201d\n\nThe new mission statement, and Cissna\u2019s justification, downplays the agency\u2019s commitment to helping immigrants become American citizens and plays up the idea that US citizens attempting to bring their family members to the US don\u2019t count as real Americans whose interests deserve to be protected.\n\nUSCIS\u2019s new mission statement doesn\u2019t just reflect the Trump administration\u2019s hawkishness toward legal as well as unauthorized immigration. It encourages the notion that Americanness is a matter of blood and soil, of birth and descent, rather than an idea that anyone can be proud of regardless of where they were born.\n\nTaking \u201ccitizenship\u201d out of the mission of Citizenship and Immigration Services\nThe changes to the USCIS mission statement don\u2019t change the work the agency actually does. But they make a symbolic statement that the Trump administration sees that work differently not just from how the Obama administration did, but from our traditional understanding of what Americanness means.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the removal of the \u201cnation of immigrants\u201d line. The new mission statement removes all references to citizenship \u2014 instead of \u201cimmigration and citizenship benefits,\u201d USCIS now just provides \u201cimmigration benefits,\u201d and \u201cpromoting an awareness and understanding of citizenship\u201d is kicked out of the mission entirely.\n\nAt the same time as the agency is deemphasizing the part of its job that involves turning immigrants into citizens, its new mission implies that the two groups \u2014 immigrants and Americans \u2014 are naturally in conflict:\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services administers the nation\u2019s lawful immigration system, safeguarding its integrity and promise by efficiently and fairly adjudicating requests for immigration benefits while protecting Americans, securing the homeland, and honoring our values.\n\nCissna\u2019s email also told USCIS staff that they\u2019re not supposed to call applicants \u201ccustomers\u201d anymore because their real customers aren\u2019t immigrants \u2014 they\u2019re the American people:\n\nReferring to applicants and petitioners for immigration benefits, and the beneficiaries of such applications and petitions, as \u2018customers\u2019 promotes an institutional culture that emphasizes the ultimate satisfaction of applicants and petitioners, rather than the correct adjudication of such applications and petitions according to the law. [...] Use of the term leads to the erroneous belief that applicants and petitioners, rather than the American people, are whom we ultimately serve.\u201d [emphasis added]\n\nIt\u2019s an odd statement to make. For one thing, USCIS is the rare federal agency that isn\u2019t primarily funded through taxes \u2014 most of the money to run the agency comes from application fees. Immigrants applying for visas, green cards, and citizenship \u2014 and the US citizens and companies that have to sponsor some of those applications \u2014 are paying USCIS for the services they provide. By a commonsense definition, that\u2019s what a customer is.\n\nBut what\u2019s even more jarring than the redefinition of \u201ccustomer\u201d is the definition of \u201cAmerican.\u201d Cissna\u2019s statement strongly implies that \u201capplicants and petitioners\u201d don\u2019t count as part of the \u201cAmerican people.\u201d That might make sense if he were talking just about people newly coming to the US, or even if he were distinguishing \u201cAmericans\u201d from noncitizens. But he\u2019s not. \n\nThe \u201capplicants\u201d Cissna refers to include immigrants who are applying for US citizenship \u2014 the part of USCIS\u2019s function that got stripped out of the mission statement. Not only does the new mission statement suggest that helping immigrants become Americans is no longer part of USCIS\u2019 job, but by distinguishing \u201capplicants\u201d from \u201cthe American people,\u201d it suggests that they can\u2019t.\n\nFurthermore, the overwhelming majority of petitioners for immigrants are US citizens petitioning for family members (or American businesses petitioning for employees). Those citizens may have been born abroad, but they\u2019ve naturalized. They are as American as anyone else. \n\nDoes the Trump administration believe immigrants can integrate?\nUSCIS tends to be the most obscure of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s three immigration agencies, precisely because it\u2019s the one that doesn\u2019t deal with immigration enforcement (Customs and Border Protection addresses border enforcement; Immigration and Customs Enforcement takes care of interior enforcement).

Nunes recused himself from the Russia investigation after the House Ethics Committee began looking into allegations that Nunes had revealed classified information, as part of a campaign against intelligence officials. \n\nNunes, a bombastic lawmaker who is a close ally of President Donald Trump, had accused intelligence agencies of spying on Trump\u2019s campaign and of bias against the president in March 2017. The Ethics Committee cleared Nunes in December, saying he hadn\u2019t revealed any classified information, but Conaway remained at the head of the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation \u2014 despite rumors that Nunes was still the one making the decisions.\n\nLast week, Conaway said he was shutting down the House investigation, arguing that all necessary evidence on the Trump campaign\u2019s contacts with Russian officials had been reviewed.\n\nThe committee is planning to vote on its final report Thursday, and that report is expected to exonerate the Trump campaign from any wrongdoing.

But that didn\u2019t end up happening. And now Conaway is now preparing to issue a highly partisan report that defends the Trump campaign, just as Nunes did.\n\nWho is Mike Conaway?\nBefore publicly taking over the Russia probe, Conaway was mostly known for his focus on government spending and financial discipline. He was one of the House leaders pushing the Pentagon to produce accounting reports for its $600 billion budget, and he serves on the House Armed Services Committee in addition to his position on the Intelligence Committee.\n\nHis work on military budgets ties together two parts of his background.\n\nAfter graduating from college with a degree in accounting, Conaway joined the Army reserve in 1970. He spent two years at Fort Hood Army Base in Texas during the Vietnam War, and then became a professional accountant.\n\nHis accounting career kickstarted his political life. Conaway was the chief financial officer for Bush Exploration, the oil firm run by President George W. Bush before Bush became governor of Texas. After Bush won the governorship, he appointed Conaway to the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy. Conaway served on the board for seven years before running for Congress in 2003 and losing by 587 votes, and then running again in 2004 after Texas\u2019 congressional districts were redrawn. \n\nConaway has never won less than 70 percent of the vote from his conservative Texas district in his six reelection bids since, and due to seniority, is the second highest ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee.\n\nConaway took over the Russia probe, but Nunes still held the power\nWhen the Ethics Committee started investigating Nunes, he recused himself from the Russia probe and picked Conaway to take over.\n\nNunes said he was stepping aside in April, after claiming that \u201cleftwing activist groups\u201d had falsely accused him of leaking classified information. Nunes said it was in the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the investigation to give Conaway control.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans voiced confidence in Conaway as the new face of the investigation. \n\n\u201cLook forward to working on investigation with @ConawayTX11,\u201d the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, Rep.

(Dowd has lately done the same, saying last weekend that the Justice Department should now \u201cbring an end to\u201d the \u201calleged Russia Collusion investigation.\u201d)\n\nDowd\u2019s exit is \u201ca largely mutual decision,\u201d coming because Trump had lost confidence in his legal strategy, and because Dowd was frustrated that Trump wanted to bring new attorneys on to the team, the Washington Post\u2019s Rosalind Helderman, Carol Leonnig, and Ashley Parker report. \n\nThe Post team also reports that Dowd \u201cdisagreed vehemently with Trump over a legal strategy\u201d at one point in recent weeks, though it\u2019s not clear what that is. Meanwhile, the New York Times\u2019 Michael Schmidt and Maggie Haberman report that Dowd is leaving because he \u201cconcluded\u201d that Trump \u201cwas increasingly ignoring his advice.\u201d\n\nTrump insisted on Twitter just 11 days ago that he was \u201cVERY happy with my lawyers\u201d and had no plans to shake up the team. But days later, he decided to bring aboard longtime conservative lawyer Joseph diGenova \u2014 who has argued on television that the Justice Department and FBI are trying to frame the president. And this might not be the end of the shakeup, either.\n\nTrump\u2019s legal team, explained\n\n\nThe Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out. Wrong. I am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow. They are doing a great job and.....\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 11, 2018\n\n\n\n\nTo keep the various members of Trump\u2019s legal team for the Mueller investigation straight, you have to keep in mind that some are outside lawyers representing Donald Trump personally, while other are official White House staffers charged with representing the office of the presidency.\n\nThe personal legal team:\n\n\nAfter last May, when Trump fired FBI director James Comey and Mueller was then appointed as special counsel, Trump put outside lawyer Marc Kasowitz in charge of his personal legal defense. But Kasowitz only lasted about two months \u2014 he was pushed out in July, amidst the Trump team\u2019s hapless response to the revelation of Don Jr.\u2019s meeting with a Russian lawyer, and amidst news that Kasowitz had sent profane and threatening emails to a stranger (\u201cWatch your back, bitch\u201d).\nThen, it was John Dowd who Trump anointed as his lead personal lawyer. Dowd had decades work of experience representing defendants accused of white-collar crimes, including in political scandals (and also, famously, investigated baseball player Pete Rose\u2019s gambling scandal for Major League Baseball back in the 1980s). He resigned Thursday.\nTrump\u2019s personal legal team also includes Jay Sekulow, a longtime conservative activist lawyer, who frequently appears on television.\nAnd just days ago, Joseph diGenova, a conservative lawyer had legal roles in high-profile political scandals for decades (and also frequently appears on television), joined Trump\u2019s personal legal team too.\n\nThe White House legal team:\n\n\nInside the White House, meanwhile, Russia- and scandal-related legal matters were first handled by White House Counsel Don McGahn. \nBut last summer, the mustachioed Ty Cobb joined the White House and became its lead lawyer handling Mueller investigation matters \u2014 reportedly at Dowd\u2019s suggestion. (Cobb also became famous for his repeated rosy claims that Mueller\u2019s investigation would soon wrap up \u2014 claims that did not quite pan out.)\n\nIs Trump opting for a more reckless legal strategy \u2014 or is he just looking for better help?\nSince diGenova has been going around claiming the FBI and Justice Department framed Trump, one might be tempted to conclude that his hiring, coupled with the president\u2019s recent rhetoric, means Trump is shifting toward a more confrontational, reckless, and even conspiratorial legal strategy. \n\nHowever, recent reports have also revealed Trump\u2019s interest in hiring two very highly respected mainstream lawyers \u2014 Emmet Flood (who represented President Bill Clinton during the impeachment saga), and Ted Olson (who\u2019s believed to be one of the best Republican litigators around \u2014 but is famous for overturning California\u2019s same-sex marriage ban). Neither hire has panned out, but the interest could indicate that Trump simply thinks he needs better representation than Dowd has been providing.\n\nThat would make sense, since Dowd\u2019s gotten his fair share of criticism. Back in December, Trump sent a tweet in which he said he fired Michael Flynn because he lied to the FBI. After many observed that this was a seeming admission of obstruction of justice \u2014 since if Trump knew Flynn committed a crime, his later request that Comey stop investigating Flynn would be an attempt to cover up a crime \u2014 Dowd said that in fact he had drafted the tweet, and had just mixed up his facts wrong.\n\nA few months before that, Dowd was infamously overheard by a New York Times reporter discussing Trump\u2019s legal strategy with Ty Cobb, the top White House lawyer for the Russia probe, during lunch at a DC steakhouse. (Trump is also rumored to be considering firing Ty Cobb \u2014 something that, considering Cobb has been completely wrong about the Mueller investigation wrapping up quickly, would also make some sense.)\n\nSo it\u2019s not clear whether things are heading right now. It is possible that Trump could bring in a highly qualified and respected top lawyer to replace Dowd. It\u2019s also possible that ... he could go in a different direction. Because one problem is that highly qualified top lawyers don\u2019t seem to have much interest in representing Trump \u2014 CNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz reports that \u201c4 defense attorneys at different large law firms have been approached to join Trump\u2019s legal defense team in recent weeks,\u201d but \u201call 4 turned him down.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "German Lopez", "body": "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has moved to ban bump stocks, devices that effectively let semiautomatic weapons mimic machine guns.\n\nOn Friday, the US Department of Justice filed a regulation that will prohibit the devices \u2014 fulfilling Trump\u2019s request to do so. The regulation would classify these devices as banned \u201cmachineguns\u201d under current federal law. The regulation will now undergo a 90-day period for public comments, after which it could be changed or go into effect as is.\n\nThe measure comes more than a month after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, which killed 17, and on the eve of the gun violence\u2013focused March for Our Lives. But the gunman in the Florida shooting did not use a bump stock \u2014 meaning the ban would have had no impact on the massacre there.\n\nThe bump stock ban originally came up in response to the Las Vegas shooting last year, in which a shooter used the devices to kill 58 others and injure hundreds more. The gunman still may have carried out the shooting without bump stocks, but the devices at least made the shooting much deadlier \u2014 by turning his semiautomatic weapons into guns that closely simulated automatics.\n\nAutomatic weapons are what many Americans think of as machine guns. They can continuously fire off a stream of bullets by simply holding down the trigger \u2014 making them very deadly. Semiautomatic weapons, by contrast, fire a single bullet per trigger pull. The difference between an automatic and a semiautomatic effectively translates to firing hundreds of rounds a minute versus dozens or so in the same time frame.\n\nUnder federal law, fully automatic weapons are technically legal only if made before 1986, when Congress passed the Firearm Owners\u2019 Protection Act. So it\u2019s illegal to manufacture new automatic weapons for civilian use.\n\nBump stocks offer a way around the law, as the Associated Press explained shortly after the Las Vegas shooting:\n\n\nThe device basically replaces the gun\u2019s shoulder rest, with a \u201csupport step\u201d that covers the trigger opening. By holding the pistol grip with one hand and pushing forward on the barrel with the other, the shooter\u2019s finger comes in contact with the trigger. The recoil causes the gun to buck back and forth, \u201cbumping\u201d the trigger.\n\nTechnically, that means the finger is pulling the trigger for each round fired, keeping the weapon a legal semi-automatic.\n\n\nThere are other modifications that achieve a similar effect, including a crank that replaces the trigger and turns a gun into what a gun aficionado channel on YouTube called \u201ca mini Gatling Gun.\u201d\n\nShortly after the Florida shooting, Trump called on the Justice Department to ban bump stocks and similar devices. The Justice Department\u2019s decision to do so comes despite a reluctance \u2014 reported as recently as December \u2014 that the Justice Department or Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) have the legal authority ban bump stocks and similar devices.\n\nThe new regulation, as CNN host Jake Tapper reported, is likely to lead to court challenges.\n\nBut even if it survives, there\u2019s a big question of just how effective this ban will be.\n\nAmerica needs to go much further than a bump stock ban\nThe bump stock ban is among several proposals Trump has made to tighten gun controls after the Florida shooting, such as improving reporting to the background check system and raising the legal age for purchasing assault-style weapons from 18 to 21. Even if all of these efforts are successful, it\u2019s unclear just how much of an effect this would all have \u2014 because they do little to quickly address the core problem behind US gun violence.\n\nThe US is unique in two key \u2014 and related \u2014 ways when it comes to guns: It has way more gun deaths than other developed nations, and it has far more guns than any other country in the world.\n\nThe US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate as Canada, more than seven times as Sweden, and nearly 16 times as Germany, according to UN data compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.)\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Javier Zarracina/Vox\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nMass shootings actually make up a small fraction of America\u2019s gun deaths, constituting less than 2 percent of such deaths in 2013. But America does see a lot of these horrific events: According to CNN, \u201cThe US makes up less than 5% of the world\u2019s population, but holds 31% of global mass shooters.\u201d\n\nThe US also has by far the highest number of privately owned guns in the world. Estimated in 2007, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 88.8 guns per 100 people, meaning there was almost one privately owned gun per American and more than one per American adult. The world\u2019s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 54.8 guns per 100 people.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Max Fisher/Washington Post\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nAnother way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world\u2019s population, yet own roughly 42 percent of all the world\u2019s privately held firearms.\n\nThese two facts \u2014 on gun deaths and firearm ownership \u2014 are related. The research, compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health\u2019s Injury Control Research Center, is pretty clear: After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths.\n\n\u201cWithin the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide,\u201d David Hemenway, the Injury Control Research Center\u2019s director, wrote in Private Guns, Public Health.\n\nFor example, a 2013 study, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, found that, after controlling for multiple variables, a 1 percent increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate at the state level.\n\nThis chart, based on data from researcher Josh Tewksbury, shows the correlation between the number of guns and gun deaths among wealthier nations:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nGuns are not the only contributor to violence. (Other factors include, for example, poverty, urbanization, and alcohol consumption.) But when researchers control for other confounding variables, they have found time and time again that America\u2019s high levels of gun ownership are a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers. \n\nThis is in many ways intuitive: People of every country get into arguments and fights with friends, family, and peers. But in the US, it\u2019s much more likely that someone will get angry at an argument and be able to pull out a gun and kill someone.\n\nGun control measures can help address this by reducing the amount of people who own guns, whether over time or immediately.\n\nThe research supports gun control: A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence \u2014 a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives.\n\nBut not all gun control is made equal. Consider the specifics of the US: If the key problem is that America has too many guns, then it needs to do something to reduce the number of guns in circulation quickly \u2014 something akin to Australia\u2019s response to a mass shooting in the late 1990s, when the country passed sweeping restrictions on firearms and enacted what was effectively a gun confiscation program for certain types of weapons. That policy not only cut the amount of guns in circulation, but, based on the research, may have cut the firearm homicide and suicide rates too.\n\nThe policies Trump has backed wouldn\u2019t achieve that. They could over time reduce the number of guns in circulation \u2014 by imposing barriers that future would-be buyers won\u2019t be able to overcome \u2014 but they don\u2019t do anything to immediately take guns out of circulation. In fact, this is typical in US policy responses to guns: After the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that killed 26, the bill Congress considered (but didn\u2019t pass) would not have implemented even universal background checks, and it certainly wouldn\u2019t have created a mandatory buyback program like Australia\u2019s.\n\nNone of that is to say that milder measures are useless. Connecticut\u2019s law requiring handgun purchasers to first pass a background check and obtain a license, for example, was followed by a 40 percent drop in gun homicides and a 15 percent reduction in gun suicides. Similar results \u2014 in the reverse \u2014 were reported in Missouri when it repealed its own permit-to-purchase law. It\u2019s difficult to separate these changes from long-term trends (especially since gun homicides have generally been on the decline for decades now), but a review of the evidence by RAND linked milder gun control measures, including background checks, to reduced injuries and deaths \u2014 and that means these measures likely saved lives.\n\nBut if America wants to get to the levels of gun deaths that its European peers report, it will likely need to go much further.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Anna North", "body": "Rep. Dan Lipinski almost lost his primary on Tuesday night against a challenger who had never run for office before.\n\nThe fact that Marie Newman, a first-time progressive candidate inspired to run in part by the election of President Donald Trump, almost beat Lipinski, a rare anti-abortion Democrat and an entrenched multi-term incumbent, says a lot about the country as a whole. \n\nIn the wake of Trump\u2019s election, voters are especially energized around issues that have sometimes been dismissed as \u201cidentity politics\u201d \u2014 reproductive and other civil rights. Issues that Newman, who supports abortion rights, made central to her campaign. And even though Newman didn\u2019t win, the fact she came so close is an encouraging sign for the wave of women in difficult races this year.\n\nNewman came from behind and almost won\nNewman started the race far behind her opponent. Polls in January gave Lipinski a 24-point lead, according to USA Today, and a February survey commissioned by the Lipinski campaign put Newman\u2019s name recognition in the district at just 13 percent. \n\nWhile Newman had directed a national anti-bullying nonprofit and served as a state spokesperson for the gun-control group Moms Demand Action, she had never run for office before. Lipinski, meanwhile, had served seven terms in Congress, taking over from his father, William Lipinski \u2014 together, the two had served a combined 35 years.\n\nWilliam Lipinski had a major hand in getting his son into Congress in the first place, according to David Bernstein of Chicago magazine, who wrote in 2010 that \u201cafter winning the 2004 primary election William withdrew and then urged Democratic Party leaders to slate Daniel\u2014living in Tennessee at the time\u2014virtually assuring his son\u2019s victory against token Republican opposition.\u201d\n\nDespite Lipinski\u2019s long entrenchment in Chicago politics, Newman was able to make up nearly all of her polling deficit. As of Wednesday morning, Lipinski was ahead 51 percent to 49 percent with 98 percent of districts reporting, according to CNN \u2014 a lead of about 2,124 votes.\n\n\u201cAfter reviewing the results, we know that we lost by a thin margin,\u201d Newman said in a statement conceding the race on Wednesday. \u201cIt was a good fight and I am so proud of the grassroots movement we built.\u201d\n\nNewman had help in her fight, including support from progressive groups like NARAL Pro-Choice America; Emily\u2019s List, which helps elect pro-choice Democratic female candidates to office; and Planned Parenthood. But Lipinski had help too, including a seven-figure investment from the centrist groups No Labels and Country Forward, and a six-figure spend by the anti-abortion organization Susan B. Anthony List, which bought Facebook ads, dispatched canvassers to knock on doors, and sent direct mail asking voters to \u201cimagine someone killing a 7-pound baby for any reason, or no reason at all.\u201d\n\nNewman\u2019s performance could be good news for reproductive rights, and for candidates like her\nMuch of Newman\u2019s campaign focused on painting Lipinski as out of touch with his district on a number of issues, including health care (he voted against the Affordable Care Act), immigration, and reproductive rights. These issues are especially important to Democrats in the wake of Trump\u2019s election, according to research by Jennifer Lawless, director of the Women  Politics Institute at American University. And Newman\u2019s strong performance on Tuesday showed that her approach, while not quite enough to push her over the top, still resonated with Chicago-area voters.\n\nNewman may also have succeeded in pushing Lipinski to the left. \u201cSince we started our campaign, Dan Lipinski has moved his position on health care, a path to citizenship, and the need for a fair minimum wage,\u201d she said in her concession statement. \u201cWe put him on notice that we expect better for all of the people in our district.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the fact that Newman was able to perform so well against an incumbent could be a good sign for the wave of women running for office this year, many of them in tough races. An NPR analysis published on Tuesday cautioned that \u201cthe influx of women candidates, beyond being heavily Democratic, features a glut of Democratic women running in races currently considered to be easy Republican wins.\u201d \n\nSpecifically, 49 percent of Democratic women running for congressional or gubernatorial seats, not including incumbents, are in \u201clikely\u201d or \u201csafe\u201d Republican districts, NPR\u2019s Danielle Kurtzleben wrote.\n\nSome of those women are sure to lose in November (or in their primaries before then). But Newman\u2019s relative success suggests that the right newcomer can motivate voters this year, even against a powerful incumbent. \n\n\u201cThe momentum is with Democratic pro-choice women,\u201d said a spokesperson for Emily\u2019s List, citing historic victories for women in the Virginia state legislature last year, as well as more recent wins at the state and local level. Women first-time candidates endorsed by Emily\u2019s List this election cycle include Gina Ortiz Jones, who would be the first lesbian, first Iraq War veteran, and first Filipina American to hold a House seat in Texas if she wins in the state\u2019s 23rd District in November, according to HuffPost. \n\nAnother is Lauren Underwood, the first African-American woman to run for Congress from Illinois\u2019s 14th District. On Tuesday, she won her primary against six men.\n\nNewman, meanwhile, is focused on the future, pledging to work to unseat Lipinski in 2020. As Erin Vilardi, founder and CEO of VoteRunLead, told NPR, a credible run in one election can help a candidate get more name recognition and party clout for a future run.\n\nWhether or not she decides to run again, her primary race showed that a female first-time candidate running on a progressive platform can mount a serious challenge to a longtime incumbent \u2014 an important lesson for November and beyond.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Dylan Scott", "body": "In a remarkable twist of karma, health care could defeat Republicans at the polls this November.\n\nOpposition to the Affordable Care Act helped sweep the GOP into power eight years ago. But after they spent the last year failing to repeal it while the Trump administration waged a quiet administrative war against the law, Republicans in Congress are facing the very real possibility that health care could animate the backlash that could force them out of power next year.\n\nThat is the subtext of this week\u2019s fight in Congress over whether to include stabilizing the health care law in the government spending bill. Republicans who support stabilization cite reducing premiums as their top priority: Outside experts have projected a 40-percent drop in premiums for ACA plans if stabilization measures were put in place, though estimates from the Congressional Budget Office are not quite as rosy. Those lawmakers haven\u2019t fallen in love with Obamacare or anything, but they see the political utility of lowering premiums.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, know they have a winning issue on their hands. Progressive operatives note that 2019 premiums are supposed to be announced in October \u2014 just a few weeks before the election. Given that last year\u2019s premium increases were rightly attributed to Trump\u2019s sabotage \u2014 and that voters tend to blame the party in power anyway for what is right or wrong with their health care \u2014 that could provide more ammunition for the Democrats in their final attacks right before voters head to the polls.\n\nFrom special elections over the last year, we know health care has been a powerful motivator for Democratic voters. In his razor-thin win in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th congressional district, Democrat Conor Lamb decisively won the health care vote. Polling uniformly shows Americans trust the minority party in Congress over the majority on health care.\n\nRepublicans can\u2019t undo all of the damage of the last year. They have already voted for various unpopular repeal bills that would have left 20 million fewer Americans with health insurance and that would have unwound protections for people with preexisting conditions. \n\nThose attacks are baked in. The GOP\u2019s only remaining hope is to try to mitigate premium increases for next year \u2014 and then hope health care isn\u2019t enough to carry a blue wave.\n\nObamacare stabilization is really about the midterms\nIf you read between the lines, the impetus for Republicans who have spent eight years demonizing Obamacare deciding now to help it is pretty clear: Premiums are going up, they will keep going up without new federal funding, and Americans will blame the people in power if they do.\n\n\u201cRates will go up. The individual market will probably collapse,\u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), who has led the stabilization talks over the last year, said on the Senate floor last week, describing what would happen without a stabilization plan. \u201cThere will be 11 million people who are between jobs, who are self-employed, who are working, who literally cannot afford insurance, and they\u2019re not going to be very happy. And they\u2019re going to blame every one of us, and they should.\u201d\n\nThe polling bears this out, specifically that Republicans will take the blame for the state of Obamacare, even if they hate the law. The Kaiser Family Foundation recently found that 60 percent of Americans believe Republicans are responsible for the ACA going forward. And nothing matters more to voters on health care than its cost.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Kaiser Family Foundation\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nRepublicans already have a mess on their hands of their own making. The Trump administration\u2019s multifaceted crusade against the health care law \u2014 slashing outreach budgets and pulling the law\u2019s cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers \u2014 were already to blame for a 20 percent premium hike this year. Then Congress repealed the individual mandate in their tax bill, a huge political victory given the GOP\u2019s vehement opposition to the mandate but one that insurers have said would drive up premiums even more next year.\n\nThe Republican solution to these problems that they have created is $30 billion in reinsurance funding, proposed by Alexander, Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) and House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Greg Walden (R-OR). They want to pass the funding as part of the government spending bill that must be approved by Friday to avoid a shutdown.\n\nAlexander has clung to evidence that the plan would drive down premiums: 40 percent, according to the consulting firm Oliver Wyman, or a more modest 10 to 20 percent drop, according to the Congressional Budget Office. In either case, the stabilization bill would help avert a round of damning October headlines about skyrocketing insurance costs on the GOP\u2019s watch. (The CBO also projects a slight rise in the uninsured rate because the proposal would end up making insurance more expensive for some people who receive ACA subsidies. But that would not happen immediately.)\n\nIf they can get it passed, that is. House conservatives have always been dubious about stabilizing Obamacare, and now Democrats don\u2019t sound enthused either. \n\nThey might not want to give Republicans a win because of the politics \u2014 like I said, Democratic operatives are keenly aware of when premiums are announced \u2014 but the Trump White House made it easier for them by demanding anti-abortion riders be attached to the plan and by trying to codify an administration proposal that would unwind the ACA\u2019s protections for preexisting conditions.\n\nThat has allowed Democrats to oppose the stabilization bill on solid policy ground, while at the same time denying Republicans a win that would soften the electoral environment for the GOP.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve learned from the special elections\nFrom the Republican perspective, shoring up the insurance markets would at best stop the bleeding. Because the early returns in the midterm elections, and in the public debate over health care, have been brutal for the majority party.\n\nAt the macro level, Americans clearly trust Democrats more than Republicans on the issue. A Politico/Morning Consult poll from November found that 44 percent of voters trusted the Democrats more, compared to 34 percent who trusted Republicans more. (USA Today and Suffolk found a similar breakdown: 43 percent trusted Democrats the most, 15 percent said they trusted Trump, and 10 percent trust Republicans in Congress \u2014 harsh numbers for the GOP any way you cut them.)\n\nOn top of that, the ACA \u2014 the Republican policy boogeyman for the last decade \u2014 has never been more popular than it is today, after withstanding a year of GOP attacks.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Kaiser Family Foundation\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nSo it should come as no surprise that Democrats are already landing substantial wins on health care in this cycle\u2019s special elections thus far.\n\nIt started last summer, with Jon Ossoff\u2019s unexpectedly strong showing to replace Georgia congressman Tom Price. As Jeff Stein documented at the time for Vox, voters in that red district were overwhelming motivated by the health care debate raging on Capitol Hill over a GOP plan projected to increase the ranks of the insured by 20 million or so people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the No. 1 issue,\u201d Ossoff supporter Gopi Nath, 48, told Stein. Three-quarters of voters, even in that red-tinted district, opposed the Republican repeal bill.\n\nA few months later, in Alabama, Doug Jones surged to his shocking upset in another deep-red state by dismissing the GOP\u2019s \u201crepeal and replace\u201d promises as a political slogan and by fiercely advocating for a funding extension for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. \n\nThe most decisive win for Democrats \u2014 and for health care \u2014 was in the Pennsylvania 18th, where Trump won by 20 points just a year ago, a district Republicans had held for 15 years. The Democratic candidate, Lamb, won by less than 1,000 votes, and health care could make a compelling case it put him over the top.\n\nFrom a Public Policy Polling exit poll, taken the day after Pennsylvania\u2019s special election:\n\n\nHealth care was a top issue for 52 percent of voters: 15 percent said it was the most important issue for them and another 37 percent said that it was very important.\nThe health care voters broke hard toward Lamb: 64 percent of those who said it was their No. 1 issue backed the Democrat, and 62 percent of the people who said it was very important supported him.\nObamacare broke even in a district that Donald Trump won by 20 percentage points in 2016: 44 percent of voters supported the law, and 42 percent opposed it.\nMeanwhile, 52 percent of PA-18 voters said they opposed the Republican plans to repeal the health care law, and only 39 percent approved.\n\nThese candidates have settled on a playbook that Democrats should be able to deploy in the most Republican-leaning states and districts across the country: Slam Republicans for trying to take health insurance away from 20 million people and for trying to take away the ACA\u2019s protections for people with preexisting conditions.\n\nTake a look at Wisconsin, a reddening state that should be a battleground in 2018. There, Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin \u2014 up for her first reelection, with constituents feeling either ambivalent or uninformed about her \u2014 has made health care her signature issue. Baldwin had a preexisting condition of her own when she was a child, and she has spent the last few weeks slamming the Trump administration for undermining the ACA.\n\n\u201cHer signature issue right now is health care. Every alternative that the Republicans are offering activates progressives, and the independents are like, \u2018I\u2019m not sure about this one, gang,\u2019\u201d Scot Ross, a progressive activist in the state, told me. \u201cI think that is a feather in Sen. Baldwin\u2019s cap.\u201d\n\nSo a Democratic candidate struggling to build an identity, up for reelection in a state that Republicans have slowly conquered since 2010, turned to health care as her best bet for the fall. There is no better evidence of how health care politics have changed.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Emily Stewart", "body": "Credit reporting agency Equifax in September revealed that a data breach had left the information of 145 million customers exposed. The company waited weeks before disclosing the incident to the public, during which time three executives sold nearly $2 million worth of the company\u2019s shares.\nNot even six months later, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, under interim director Mick Mulvaney, is scaling back an investigation into what happened, according to a new report. It\u2019s the latest example of how the CFPB, which was created under the Obama administration to look out for consumers in the financial products and services  space, is stepping back from that under Trump. \nReuters reported on Monday that Mulvaney, who President Donald Trump in November tapped to temporarily head the CFPB after Director Richard Cordray stepped down, has pulled back from a full-scale probe into how Equifax failed to protect customer data. Sources told the publication that Mulvaney has not ordered subpoenas against Equifax or sought sworn testimony from executives, which it would be expected to do in a full-scale probe. It has put a pause on plans for tests of Equifax\u2019s data protection practices and turned down offers from other federal regulators for help in on-site credit bureau exams. \nTo be sure, the CFPB is not permitted to acknowledge an open investigation, but one was reportedly opened under Cordray. \u201cThe bureau has the desire, expertise, and know-how in-house to vigorously pursue hypothetical matters such as these,\u201d agency spokesman John Czwartacki told Reuters. \nCFPB representatives did not respond to an emailed request for comment from Vox. \nAmericans \u201cdeserve an explanation\u201d from Mulvaney if the Reuters report is indeed true, said Yana Miles, senior legislative counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending, in an emailed statement. \u201cThe public deserves to have a consumer protection watchdog that\u2019s going to keep financial companies and institutions accountable and transparent to the public,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is even more the case with credit bureaus, which have immense power over our financial lives.\u201d\nJust because the CFPB may be scaling back its probe doesn\u2019t mean Equifax will escape scrutiny entirely. As Reuters notes, Equifax has said it is under investigation by every state attorney general and faces more than 240 class action lawsuits. The Federal Trade Commission is examining the breach as well. \nA refresher on the Equifax breach: it was bad\nEquifax in September announced that 143 million of its US-based users \u2014 about half of all of the people in the country \u2014 had their personal information compromised from mid-May through July 2017, including Social Security numbers, birthdates, addresses, and other data. (Equifax later revised up its number of consumers affected to 145.5 million.) The company waited about six weeks between discovering the data breach and publicly announcing it. \nAfter it first announced the data breach, Equifax offered customers affected free credit monitoring and identity protection services \u2014 as long as they agreed to a forced arbitration clause that barred them from joining forces with other wronged customers to sue the company. After a backlash, the company dropped the forced arbitration clause. \nEquifax CEO Richard Smith in late September stepped down. In October, he testified before the Senate Banking Committee and faced questions about Equifax\u2019s handling of consumer data and the breach, executive stock sales, and broader issues pertaining to credit bureaus such as Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian, which handle the personal information of millions of consumers. (Credit bureaus are partly regulated by multiple agencies.) \u201cEquifax and this whole industry should be completely transformed,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said during the hearing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to change this industry before more people are injured.\u201d\nThis is just the latest example of the CFPB\u2019s changing mission\nMulvaney, who is director of the Office of Management and Budget, has been pretty aggressive at the CFPB since President Trump tapped him as interim director in November. He has revised the bureau\u2019s mission statement, adding in a line about \u201cregularly identifying and addressing outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome regulations\u201d and another about \u201cconsistently enforcing\u201d consumer financial law. \nUnder Mulvaney, the bureau hasn\u2019t announced any new enforcement actions. It has announced plans to reconsider a rule that would have imposed restrictions on payday and short-term lenders, such as making sure borrowers would be able to pay them back, and delayed a rule on prepaid cards that increased consumer protections. It dropped an investigation into World Acceptance Corporation, an installment lender that was accused of trying to profit from repeat borrowers. Mulvaney also declined to request any funding for the CFPB this quarter. \n\u201cIn a very few number of days, the acting director has done a great deal of damage,\u201d Aaron Klein, fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution and former Treasury Department aide, recently told me. \u201cWhat seems to be happening at the CFPB is kind of a reflexive, anti-whatever the last guy did approach.\u201d\nBeyond the policy and enforcement measures, some of what Mulvaney has done at the CFPB has been symbolic, and verging on petty. In December, the CFPB renamed a fellowship program for law students and recent graduates that had been named after Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who was known in the early 20th century as the \u201cpeople\u2019s lawyer\u201d for taking on major moneyed interests, including JP Morgan\u2019s railroad monopoly. \nThe fellowship was renamed after Joseph Story, a 19th century Supreme Court justice known for his defense of property rights and economic liberty. Story was a stanch opponent of President Andrew Jackson, of whom Trump is a professed fan, so it\u2019s not clear exactly what Mulvaney was going for in all of this. Carter Dougherty, communications director of Americans for Financial Reform, noted as much on Twitter.\n\n\nTHREAD: Mick Mulvaney @MickMulvaneyOMB has renamed @CFPB legal program to honor a justice who hated President Andrew Jackson, the very same president whom Trump says he reveres. 1/11\u2014 Carter Dougherty (@CarterD) January 2, 2018\n\n\n\nTrump has not yet indicated who he might nominate as permanent director of the CFPB, but in the interim, Mulvaney seems determined to quite a bit of damage. \u201cIt\u2019s discouraging to see that every week Mulvaney is finding new ways to sabotage the consumer bureau,\u201d Miles, from the Center for Responsible Lending, said.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Emily Stewart", "body": "There are perhaps few individuals whose career arcs have been more altered by Donald Trump\u2019s presidency than Preet Bharara. The former US attorney for the Southern District of New York, who was fired by the president last year after refusing to quit, this time last year was Wall Street\u2019s top cop. \nHe is now a leading voice of the opposition, hosting a podcast, offering a voice of reason on the Russia investigation, and, this week, helping launch a new initiative to turn the norms that failed to restrain Trump into laws that would actually rein in his successors. \nIn a USA Today op-ed on Monday, Bharara and former New Jersey Republican Gov. Christine Todd Whitman announced the launch of a democracy task force at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s School of Law. The task force\u2019s purpose is to examine norms on items such as financial conflicts, political interference with law enforcement, and the appointment of public officials, and issue recommendations on policies that \u201ccan be enacted that mend the gaps in our system and ensure we have a government that functions ably, competently and with the trust of the American people.\u201d\nTrump has continually tested the ethical and normative limits, whether by refusing to release his tax returns, remaining entwined in his businesses, or reportedly meddling in the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russia. Office of Government Ethics head Walter Shaub quit his job over the summer to join an outside ethics group after clashing with Trump multiple times on conflicts of interest. \nTrump\u2019s presidency has revealed how many traditions of the presidency are just that \u2014 traditions, not requirements. They\u2019re historical nice-to-haves that assume the president will continue to follow suit. Bharara and Whitman\u2019s task force hopes to give them some teeth. \n\u201cIt\u2019s taking the lessons and transgressions noted on the part of this administration and preventing those things from happening again in the future,\u201d Bharara told me.\nThey face an uphill battle. Congress could pass a law tomorrow requiring the president to release his tax returns or truly divest from his businesses. But so far, Republicans on the Hill have been less than eager to constrain the president.\nStill, Bharara and Whitman are optimistic. I spoke with Bharara about the task force\u2019s goals, his thoughts on the current state of our union, and what he thinks of some of the recent developments at the Justice Department and the FBI. \u201cEverything is on the table so long as it serves the purpose of figuring out which traditions are no longer acceptable on an honor system and need to be enforced,\u201d he said.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nEmily Stewart\nCan you talk a little bit about this initiative you\u2019ve launched \u2014 the democracy task force \u2014 what the idea behind it is, and what you\u2019re hoping to get out of it? \nPreet Bharara\nThe idea is, as we lay out in the op-ed, that there are lots of people of goodwill and good faith on both sides of the political aisle and all across the spectrum. And I think a lot of people \u2014 and I\u2019ve discovered this just from being in the country as a citizen paying attention, but also from interviewing guests on the podcast \u2014 there are a lot of people who believe there are certain things that need to be addressed on a bipartisan basis. \nThere are a lot of people of good faith that think there is some overreaching going on. And a lot of people are naturally focusing on the everyday, what happens today, what happens tomorrow; the news cycle is so rushed and so crazed that it\u2019s almost like people are reacting in the moment, in a frenzy. \nIn conversations with the Brennan Center and with other folks, we thought there should be some focus on the long-term detriment to institutions and all the ways in which the current administration \u2014 and every administration does some version of this \u2014 but the ways in which the current administration is defying all these norms that presents the question: Which of those things should we make sure are codified into hard laws? \nWe don\u2019t consider this to be partisan at all; that\u2019s why there\u2019s a Republican former governor and me. We have [former Republican senator and defense secretary] Chuck Hagel, we have Don Verrilli, who was Obama\u2019s solicitor general, to really sort of think more deeply over a period of time. \nWe\u2019re not on a 24-hour deadline. We want to think long-term about the country, ways that we ensure democracy, and there are a lot of things that are on the table. We haven\u2019t convened and done our work yet, but we\u2019re hoping we can make commonsense proposals that can be implemented in the coming years, some of which, maybe, while this president is in office, and some that can be done later. \nThe example we use in the op-ed is a powerful one. You had two popular presidents, Roosevelt and Kennedy, both of whom did things that the American people decided, \u201cYou know what? That was a bit much. It\u2019s a bit rich to put your own brother in as attorney general.\u201d And I think it\u2019s useful, after every presidency, to think about these things, and that\u2019s sort of the animating principle for this. \nEmily Stewart\nRight, so those examples you cited, FDR staying on for four terms and Congress enacting a two-term limit for presidents; JFK appointing his brother attorney general and Congress passing an anti-nepotism law; all of the laws enacted after Nixon \u2014 that all took place in a different moment. Right now, we have a Congress that is funding the government in three-week increments. Do you feel like this might be out of touch with what\u2019s possible right now?  \nPreet Bharara\nThe point of this is that it\u2019s a long-term effort. We\u2019re not suggesting we\u2019re going to run through the halls of Congress right now and say, \u201cPass this thing we drafted overnight!\u201d In fact, that\u2019s how Congress tends to do things, and it doesn\u2019t turn out well. \nWe\u2019re hoping to have a lot of people who care about the country for different political perspectives, very different political perspectives, think about both what\u2019s good, what\u2019s right, what\u2019s practical, and, my view would be, as one of the co-chairs, what is politically salable to people in the future. \nLook, I don\u2019t know what Congress is going to look like in 12 months when the next session is sworn in. There are members of the task force who probably have one view and I have a different view. But I think the hope is that the more voices there are talking about what kinds of reforms you need and what kinds of laws you might need, people will come on board. \nThe other thing is people are more likely to act with common sense and in the interest of the public if we\u2019re enacting things \u2014 and not everyone will love what I\u2019m about to say \u2014 if we\u2019re enacting things for the future that will affect the next president, whether it\u2019s a Democrat or a Republican. Some things are impossible to pass because you have political allies of the current administration who don\u2019t want to hamper the current administration. We\u2019re saying there may be things that we need to do to curtail overreaching on the part of the current president. \nMore importantly, I think, we\u2019re talking about the long-term, not just about Donald Trump but about any future president, Democrat or Republican. And I think a lot of people might get on board \u2014 not knowing who the eventual nominee or president will be in the future \u2014 on an idea, for example, for there to be a requirement, not just a tradition, that people who run for president disclose their tax returns. \nThe next time around, it could be a deeply conflicted, rich Democrat running for president who says, \u201cHey, screw it, Donald Trump didn\u2019t have to do it, I\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d I don\u2019t think Republicans who are currently allies of Donald Trump, because there\u2019s a lot of hypocrisy here we\u2019re looking to cut through, would like that either. So that\u2019s just an example of the kind of thing I think, over time, could be a proposal that carries some weight.\nEmily Stewart\nSo this is really a longer-term play.\nPreet Bharara\nI mean, we\u2019re not talking about glaciers. But we\u2019re not talking about the 24-hour news cycle. Maybe there are things that we\u2019ll propose in the coming months that can be acted upon quickly, but the thrust of this is to have some time to think deeply and wisely about these issues and develop consensus over time. \nEmily Stewart\nIs your focus only on the presidency, or are you also planning to look at other areas of government \u2014 say, Congress? For example, you have House Republicans voting to release that secret memo put together by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA).\nPreet Bharara\nThe heart of this and what spurred it is a look at the executive branch. As Gov. Whitman pointed out on television, yeah, everything\u2019s open. When we\u2019re fully constituted and meeting and talking about it, I think everything is on the table so long as it serves the purpose of figuring out which traditions are no longer acceptable on an honor system and need to be enforced, and that includes regular order in Congress, I suppose. I think that\u2019s an important part of it; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the central part of it. What we\u2019re talking about more is the executive branch, but other branches are open to discussions, scrutiny, and reform as well. \nEmily Stewart\nSo if you were to boil this down, this is looking for lessons learned from the Trump presidency and how to put that into law.\nPreet Bharara\nYeah, the way I always put it \u2014 which is a very nerdy way of saying it \u2014 is which soft norms should be enacted into hard laws. And yeah, it\u2019s taking the lessons and transgressions noted on the part of this administration and preventing those things from happening again in the future.\nEmily Stewart\nTo shift gears a little bit, what are your thoughts on FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe\u2019s exit? The situation, obviously, isn\u2019t entirely similar to yours, but as another Justice Department official [who was] pushed out, what\u2019s your take on it? \nPreet Bharara\nI don\u2019t know all the facts or the details. There was a report that suggested that [FBI Director] Christopher Wray threatened to resign rather than remove McCabe, and then it looks like it removed McCabe, so I don\u2019t know if there was a change in circumstances. \nWhat I do know is, my personal interactions with Andy McCabe tell me that he is a good and honorable person. I worked cases with him as a junior prosecutor, a line prosecutor, out of the Southern District of New York 15 years ago on the Russian organized crime squad. I know him to be a good, upright, and honorable person, and I don\u2019t like or enjoy the character assassination I see of him and other people. \nEmily Stewart\nSo last week we had this report that President Trump tried to order the firing of special counsel Robert Mueller last summer, and over the weekend, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said Trump firing Mueller would be the end of his presidency. What do you think would happen if he did?\nPreet Bharara\nLindsey Graham says a lot of things that he changes his mind on, because he\u2019s a politician, like a lot of politicians. And I like Lindsey Graham, but he\u2019s a little bit of a weathervane himself.\nWhat would happen? I don\u2019t know. It would be very bad for the country. A lot of people are on record saying that they would take it very seriously, but that remains to be seen. It\u2019s a real concern and fear that people should have. \nEmily Stewart\nFor just an everyday person looking at the Russia investigation and the Mueller investigation right now, what should they be looking out for to have a sense of the direction it\u2019s going in?\nPreet Bharara\nMy view is, which reporters don\u2019t like, watch and see what the public actions of Bob Mueller are. Nothing speaks more loudly than his announcements of charges, indictments, and guilty pleas, and everything else is speculation. \nA lot of these news reports are correct, and a lot of them are not fully correct, and sometimes the devil is in the details. Sometimes, when there are reports that someone in the White House told someone else to do something, it may be more nefarious than is being reported, based on the limited sources that people have, or it may be less nefarious. I\u2019d like to see the results of the actual investigators with subpoena power and grand jury power and see what they come up with.\nEmily Stewart \nAnd finally, in light of Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, how would you characterize the state of the union right now?\nPreet Bharara\nIn peril. In peril.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Emily Stewart", "body": "According to state-run exit polls and early returns, Vladimir Putin has won another term as Russia\u2019s president. He faced no genuine opposition during his presidential campaign, and used all of the tools of his government\u2019s well-oiled propaganda machine to ensure he received a huge percentage of the vote.\n\nPutin\u2019s win, which cements him as one of the most powerful leaders in modern Russian history, means he will remain in office until at least 2024. He has spent years using brute force to reestablish Russia\u2019s prominence as a world power, and his aggressive approach included invading and annexing part of eastern Ukraine, and helping Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad retain his hold on power despite years of brutal fighting. \n\nPutin has also benefitted from the election of Donald Trump, who is arguably the most pro-Russian US president in modern history. The American intelligence community unanimously believes that Moscow interfered in the 2016 election to sway its result towards Trump, but the president has both angrily dismissed those assertions and shied away from seriously punishing Russia for its meddling. Trump has not yet weighed in on Sunday\u2019s election.\n\nStill, there are some signs that President Trump may finally be willing to confront Putin for at least some of his misdeeds. On Thursday, March 15, Trump joined the UK and other European allies in accusing Moscow of using a deadly nerve agent to poison a former Russian spy and his daughter not far from their home in the British town of Salisbury. \n\nThat same day, the US Treasury Department announced long-awaited sanctions to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential elections. The measures targeted more than 20 Russian individuals and organizations, including the Internet Research Agency, a Kremlin-linked troll farm that sought to interfere in the election, and Yevgeny Prigozhin, known as \u201cPutin\u2019s chef,\u201d for his role in bankrolling Russian hackers.\n\nThis means that Putin\u2019s latest victory may not be as sweeping as the numbers would suggest. Putin won at the ballot box, but whether he\u2019ll keep winning in his confrontations with the US, the UK, and other Western countries remains to be seen.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly surprising that Putin won\nHeading into Sunday\u2019s election, there was little doubt that Putin would win \u2014 the question was, largely, by how much. \n\nAccording to a nationwide exit poll conducted by All-Russia Opinion Research Center (VTsIOM), a state-run entity, Putin won 73.9 percent of Sunday\u2019s presidential vote, beating out seven other candidates.\n\nHis nearest challenger, Communist Party candidate Pavel Grudinin, received 11.2 percent of the vote, and ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky had 6.7 percent. The Central Elections Commission said Putin had won about 72 percent of the vote with 22 percent of the country\u2019s precincts reporting. In 2012, Putin received just under 65 percent of the vote. \n\nAccording to the Associated Press, there were widespread reports of ballot-box stuffing and forced voting on Sunday, and Putin was trying to win by a large margin to ensure his mandate to govern is indisputable. His most visible opponent \u2014 anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny \u2014 wasn\u2019t even on the ballot. He was barred from running because he was convicted of fraud in a case that was widely considered to be politically motivated.\n\nAhead of the election, voter turnout was considered to be the main signifier of Putin\u2019s hold on Russia. Independent surveys show that most Russians approve of Putin as president, which might have kept people home as they may have assumed the results were already decided. \n\nThe Kremlin was also reportedly aiming to surpass 2012\u2019s 65 percent turnout level. At 6 pm Moscow time on Sunday, Russia\u2019s Central Election Commission said nationwide turnout was slightly above the level it reached during the 2012 election at that time. \n\nAfter casting his ballot in Moscow on Sunday, Putin said he sought a level of turnout that \u201cgives me the right to perform the duty of president,\u201d according to the New York Times. \u201cI am sure I am offering the right program to the country.\u201d \n\nIt is also worth noting that the 2012 Russian election arguably laid the groundwork for Putin\u2019s election meddling in the American presidential election in 2016. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton raised questions about the legitimacy of 2012\u2019s Russian vote, which Putin took personally and has never forgiven. US intelligence agencies believe that may be why he tried to ensure she lost in 2016.\n\nPutin is facing more pushback on the global stage \nPutin\u2019s Sunday victory may give him even more power in Russia, but he is facing increasing pressure from the international community due to a recent nerve agent attack in the UK and Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nOn March 4, Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury, England. It turned out they had been poisoned with a highly toxic nerve agent.\n\nEight days later, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that Russia was behind the attack on the Skripals. When asked about the event later that day, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to directly blame Russia but said that \u201cwe offer the fullest condemnation\u201d of the attack.\n\nBut on Thursday, the White House issued a joint statement with allies to support Britain\u2019s claim, which said: \u201cThe United Kingdom thoroughly briefed its allies that it was highly likely that Russia was responsible for the attack. We share the United Kingdom\u2019s assessment that there is no plausible alternative explanation.\u201d\n\nMoscow, however, denies it had any hand in the attack but has said it will cooperate with a British investigation if it receives samples of the nerve agent believed to have been used. \n\nThe sanctions that the US Treasury Department issued on Thursday have a bit more of a backstory. In January 2017, the US intelligence community assessed that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election, helping Trump win the White House. Last August, Trump reluctantly signed into law the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), which was designed to make old sanctions against Russia permanent, and to pressure Trump to impose new ones. \n\nThe legislation forced Trump to impose costs on Putin for interfering in America\u2019s democratic process and for his interventions in Ukraine and Syria. Republican and Democratic lawmakers crafted the bill in response to Trump\u2019s unusual warmth toward Russian President Vladimir Putin and his refusal to blame Russia for election interference; it passed both chambers almost unanimously \u2014 98-2 in the Senate and 419-3 in the House \u2014 and it was clear that Congress would override a presidential veto. \n\nBut Trump resented Congress\u2019s move to box him in on Russia policy. The president slammed the legislation in a signing statement, calling it \u201cseriously flawed,\u201d and said that he could \u201cmake far better deals with foreign countries than Congress.\u201d CAATSA was intended to force Trump to impose sanctions in late January \u2014 but he missed the deadline. Instead, the administration released a list of 210 Russian leaders and billionaires with purported ties to Putin in order to show that the administration was watching them.\n\nThen, on March 6, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats announced that new sanctions on Russia were imminent. Mnuchin added that Trump was \u201cfully supportive of the work we\u2019re doing.\u201d On Thursday, March 15, the measures were finally announced. Senior administration officials told reporters that the sanctions were meant to punish Russia for interfering in the 2016 election and for masterminding a global cyberattack, known as NotPetya, that hit large corporations and hospitals in the US and Europe last summer.\n\n\u201cThe administration is, arguably for the first time, directly acknowledging and responding to Russia\u2019s intervention in the 2016 campaign,\u201d said Sean Kane, a former sanctions official at the Treasury Department.\n\nThe new measures target five Russian organizations and 19 Russian individuals. The big organizational targets include two Russian intelligence agencies, known by their acronyms FSB and GRU, and prominent individuals like Prigozhin. That means people connected to the intelligence agencies, and Prigozhin himself, cannot travel to America or do business with American companies, and will soon see their US assets frozen. Experts also say the timing of the sanctions was surely meant to show support for London and condemn Moscow after the nerve agent attack.\n\nThe question remains, though \u2014 does this mean Trump\u2019s attitude toward Russia has changed? Well, it\u2019s complicated.\n\nIs Trump tough on Russia now?\nDespite the sanctions, Trump continues to minimize the extent of Russia\u2019s involvement in his election. He thinks Russia didn\u2019t interfere \u2014 and that Democrats use the Trump-Russia narrative as an excuse for losing the election. Trump has famously called the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russia a \u201cWITCH HUNT!\u201d\n\nEven Trump\u2019s own national security team said he could be tougher on Russia. On February 13, Coats, the intelligence director, told the Senate Intelligence Committee that Russia would continue to interfere in American elections, saying, \u201cFrankly, the United States is under attack.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later, on February 27, Adm. Michael Rogers, who leads US Cyber Command, said during a congressional hearing that Trump had yet to ask him to take measures against Russia\u2019s hackers. \u201cIf we don\u2019t change the dynamic here, this is going to continue, and 2016 won\u2019t be viewed as something isolated,\u201d Rogers told the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cThis is something that will be sustained over time.\u201d\n\nOther military leaders have echoed the admiral\u2019s sentiment, including Army Lt. Gen. Paul Nakasone, Trump\u2019s nominee to replace Rogers after he retires this spring. \u201cI would say right now they do not think much will happen to them,\u201d he said of Russia during one of his confirmation hearings on Thursday, March 1. \u201cThey don\u2019t fear us.\u201d\n\nThat, in part, is why experts seem skeptical that Trump will suddenly become a Russia hawk. Trump has \u201ca reluctance ... to speak clearly about the threat Russia poses to the United States and our allies,\u201d Evelyn Farkas, formerly the Pentagon\u2019s top Russia official, said in an interview. \n\nAnd lawmakers, many of whom are usually critical of the president, feel he could do more to punish Russia. California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement on Thursday that if the president believes Thursday\u2019s action \u201csufficiently addresses the sanctions package Congress sent to respond forcefully to Moscow\u2019s election interference, then he is sorely mistaken.\u201d\n\nTrump likes to boast that he\u2019s much tougher on Russia than his predecessor Barack Obama. But this past week is the first time he really did anything to back up that claim. \u201cBy no means will this constitute the end to our ongoing campaign to instruct Mr. Putin to change his behavior,\u201d a senior administration official told reporters on Thursday morning.\n\nThe US president has yet to weigh in on the latest Russian election results, and it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how he\u2019ll respond.

This is in part due to fundamentals that favor the party out of power in midterm elections, but President Trump\u2019s unpopularity has also given Democrats across the country something to rally around. And special elections have been very good for Democrats so far; they have swept a number of state races in red districts in Virginia, Wisconsin, and Kentucky, plus the Senate race in Alabama.\n\nLamb rarely mentions Trump in his campaign speeches.

Job declines in the US coal industry will likely continue, Obama regulations are not responsible for its ills, and nothing the federal government can do, short of declaring martial law and forbidding the closure of coal-fired power plants, can save it. \nTrump exploited coal\u2019s cultural resonance in his campaign\nCoal has always had strong cultural resonance in the US. \n\nIn his campaign, Trump seized on that resonance with an odd kind of fervor, using miners as props in political rallies and promising, again and again, to put them back to work. He has managed to make the fate of coal miners a synecdoche for the fate of the white working class writ large.\nWhat\u2019s distasteful is that Trump has won the allegiance of coal communities by reinforcing and amplifying the lie they have been told by right-wing media and politicians for years: that Obama is responsible for the coal industry\u2019s (and their) recent woes. \nIt\u2019s not true.

The struggles facing Appalachian coal country are very real. Unemployment, ill health, drug addiction, stress, and depression have ravaged the region. Now thousands of retired coal miners are in danger of losing their pensions and health care benefits. \n(Guess who has refused to schedule a vote on a bill that would address that crisis? One Addison Mitchell McConnell, Republican leader of the Senate. Guess who had a plan to funnel $30 billion to suffering Appalachian communities? One Hillary Rodham Clinton, the competent, boring president America might have had, if not for her emails.) \nIt does people in the region no good to believe that coal jobs will come roaring back once pesky pollution regulations are overturned. It sets them up for more disappointment and wastes time and energy they could be devoting to finding a new and better future for their communities. \nSo let\u2019s put this story to rest once and for all, with numbers. Let\u2019s look at what has happened to US coal, its future prospects, and what Trump can and can\u2019t do for it. \nHelpfully, the Columbia Center on Global Energy Policy released a superb report on this subject back in April 2016, authored by Trevor Houser, Jason Bordoff, and Peter Marsters. It is a close empirical analysis of coal\u2019s history, what has happened to it recently, and what is responsible. Also: great graphs. It\u2019s really worth reading if you have 50 pages\u2019 worth of curiosity about this stuff, but if you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll cover the highlights.\nCoal\u2019s recent decline has been rapid and brutal\nLet\u2019s start with the facts to be explained.\nIn 2011, US coal was riding high, recovering from the recession and planning enormous expansion. Then between 2011 and 2016, it absolutely cratered. US coal production dropped by 27 percent. Domestic demand fell 30 percent. Demand for exports dried up. \nThe combined market value of the country\u2019s four big coal companies dropped from $33 billion to $150 million (yes, you read that right). Three of the four declared bankruptcy, in the process shedding hundreds of millions in retiree pension and health care obligations. Some 120,000 retired miners and dependents are now at risk of losing what they have left.\nAnd more than 58,000 coal miners and contractors lost their jobs, the latest chapter in the long decline in US coal mining employment.\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        (CGEP)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nNationally, the loss of 58,000 jobs is not a big deal. (The US economy creates more than 100,000 jobs a month.) But the losses were highly concentrated in mining communities. In Mingo County, West Virginia, for example, overall employment fell from 8,513 to 4,878. Imagine: Half the people in your community lose their jobs in the space of five years, in what is effectively the only local industry.\nIt left coal communities devastated and desperate.\nExactly what has waged war on coal, and how much\nSo what\u2019s responsible for this wreckage? Houser et al. set out to put some numbers on it. \nThey did so by comparing coal\u2019s actual performance with 2006 Energy Information Administration projections, corrected for the decline in overall demand (which the EIA, like everyone else, completely failed to anticipate). Then they did the same for natural gas and renewables. Finally, they \u201cexplored how each fuel\u2019s share of total interconnect-level generation varied in 2016 from what the EIA had projected.\u201d \nComparing projections with actual performance, they were able to quantify how much of coal\u2019s projected market share was eaten up by competitors (and other forces). Here are the culprits, the leading brigades in the \u201cwar on coal,\u201d listed by size:\n\nNatural gas: 49 percent\nLower-than-expected demand: 26 percent\nRenewable energy: 18 percent\nObama regulations: 3 to 5 percent\n\nThe impact of regulations was calculated somewhat differently, based on the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s projected costs, which historically have tended to be much lower than industry\u2019s projections but much higher than actual after-the-fact costs. And the researchers modeled what would happen if Obama\u2019s most significant regulations simply vanished. In reality, they won\u2019t vanish; they will probably just be weakened after months or years of rulemaking and legal challenge. \nSo 5 percent should be considered an unrealistically high upper bound for the impact of Obama\u2019s regs. (There\u2019s much discussion of methodological challenges in the report.)\nWhat\u2019s clear is that the \u201cwar on coal\u201d was led by cheap, fracked natural gas. Renewables and efficiency played vital supporting roles. Obama\u2019s regulations were, in comparison, a peashooter. \nThe secret weapon in the war on coal: collapsing Chinese demand\nMost discussion of declining demand for US coal focuses on the US electricity sector (which is responsible for 93 percent of domestic coal consumption), specifically the twin booms in natural gas and renewables. And those are indeed significant (if oft-told) stories. \nBut the most important \u2014 and most overlooked \u2014 story on coal demand is international.\nI wrote a longer post on the subject here, but the TL;DR version is: In the first decade of the 21st century, Chinese demand for coal went through the roof. \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        (CEGP)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nFor a while, China was able to keep up with demand with domestic coal. But eventually its internal supply lines grew strained, and it started importing more, increasing the price of coal on international markets \u2014 particularly metallurgical coal, which is used to make steel (and which Appalachia provides). US exports boomed.\n\u201cWhile only 12 percent of this growth was actually shipped to China,\u201d Houser et al. write, \u201cit was China-driven growth in global coal prices that made US exports to closer markets in Europe and Latin America commercially viable.\u201d\nIt was exports that were driving the US coal boom in 2011 \u2014 and it was exports that account for more than half the decline in demand through 2016.\nChina\u2019s demand for coal plateaued and recently began declining. Even if it rallies a little here and there (as it did this year), it is never going back to gangbusters growth. (And no, as the report discusses at length, growth in India won\u2019t be enough to make up the difference.)\nCoal executives did not see the China pivot coming. At all. They made huge bets on the premise that Chinese demand would grow forever. They screwed themselves. \nWell, actually, they\u2019ll be fine \u2014 they\u2019re even getting bonuses! (Seriously.) They screwed their workers, the landscapes they operate in, and, as it turned out, US politics. \nTrump\u2019s blustery regulatory rollback can\u2019t do much for coal\nTo find out what Trump could possibly do for US coal demand, the researchers modeled scenarios in which the following Obama rules were simply canceled:\n\nEPA\u2019s CO2 standards for new power plants\nEPA\u2019s CO2 standards for existing power plants (the \u201cClean Power Plan\u201d)\nEPA\u2019s methane regulations for new oil and gas production\nThe Bureau of Land Management\u2019s methane regulations for both new and existing oil and gas production on federal lands\nThe Department of Interior\u2019s coal leasing moratorium on federal lands \n\nAs I said \u2014 and Brad Plumer described in detail \u2014 permanently getting rid of those rules will be enormously difficult in practice. It will take years, and the result won\u2019t be no rules but, at best, weakened rules. So this is a theoretical upper bound on what Trump can accomplish with his attack on Obama\u2019s rules.\nThere\u2019s tons of interesting discussion in the report, but it\u2019s all captured in this graph:\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        (CEGP)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThis shows historical US coal consumption and projections of coal consumption in the face of Obama\u2019s rules (or their absence). Those are the red and blue lines.\nBut note: The red Trump line is the central projection, based on the EIA\u2019s projections of the price of natural gas and renewables. The EIA could well be \u2014 and usually has been \u2014 wrong about how prices will evolve. There\u2019s enormous uncertainty.\nSo the shaded red area shows the range of Trump projections, based on scenarios in which natural gas and renewables turn out cheaper (or more expensive) than the EIA expects.\nThe most notable feature of this result is that the range of uncertainty around the Trump scenario is greater than the difference between the Trump scenario and the Obama scenario. In other words, over coming decades, market trends promise to be more consequential for US coal consumption than all Obama\u2019s rules combined. \nAnd it\u2019s worth remembering that natural gas and renewables have both tended to prove cheaper than EIA projections. Here, for instance, are recent natural gas prices compared with forecasts (\u201cAEO\u201d stands for the EIA\u2019s Annual Energy Outlook):\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        (CEGP)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nProjections keep showing prices plateauing or rising; real prices keep falling. The same is true for EIA projections on solar and wind.\nIf EIA is still underestimating natural gas and renewables \u2014 as seems likely \u2014 then it is entirely possible that US coal consumption could decline so much that it completely swamps the effect of Trump\u2019s executive order. Just as market developments were primarily responsible for coal\u2019s decline, it is market developments that will primarily determine its future. Trump, like Obama, is wielding a peashooter. \nAt the very best, Trump\u2019s regulatory assault, if it is coupled with unexpectedly high natural gas and renewable energy prices, could boost US coal consumption back up to 2015 levels. \n\u201cThe problem,\u201d Plumer wrote in a previous post on this, \u201cis that in 2015, mining employment was still at near-historically low levels. There were only about 63,000 miners in America that year \u2014 somewhat higher than today\u2019s levels of 50,000 \u2014 but still lower than at any point since the 1980s.\u201d\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Sad!\n      \n      \n        (CEGP)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nIn reality, Trump\u2019s regulatory assault is likely to have as many failures as successes. Natural gas prices, renewable energy prices, and overall demand are likely to be beneath projections (again). US coal consumption and coal mining jobs are likely to continue declining. The market\u2019s war on coal will continue.\nThat is a far cry from Trump\u2019s promises to coal miners.\n\n\n\"Basically, you know what this is?\" Trump says to miners as he signs exec order. \"You know what it says, right? You\u2019re going back to work.\"\u2014 Juliet Eilperin (@eilperin) March 28, 2017\n\n\n\nWhat coal mining communities actually need to rebound\nThe report concludes with a short discussion of the kinds of things that might actually help suffering coal mining communities. It touches on a few of the local efforts underway and notes that the federal government can help:\nThere is a lot the federal government can do to help accelerate locally driven economic diversification efforts. Infrastructure investment, tax credits, and repurposing of abandoned mine land that has other economic use can attract new investment and job creation. Expanded broadband access is particularly important as it can overcome the geographic barriers that limit coal communities\u2019 physical access to both suppliers and markets and enable new types of economic activity. Competitive grants can help get nascent economic diversification initiatives off the ground. And the federal government can help provide retirement and healthcare security by passing the Miners\u2019 Protection Act.\n(More on the Miners Protection Act \u2014 sponsored by West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and a bipartisan list of 25 other senators \u2014 here.)\nTrump\u2019s budget proposed to slash funding for many of the existing federal programs that help Appalachia, most notably the Appalachian Regional Commission and the Economic Development Administration. Those are just a few of the cuts he favored that would hurt coal communities and workers. Spending has to be cut, after all, to make way for Congress\u2019s enormous tax cut for corporations and the wealthy.\nAnd thus far, Trump has been publicly silent about the threat to miner pensions, though he\u2019s assured Manchin in private that he intends to speak up about it, and he usually keeps his promises, so that\u2019s all good.\nThe GOP\u2019s loyalty to coal communities seems to extend exactly as far as rolling back pollution regulations, and no further. Coincidentally, rolling back pollution regulations also enriches fossil fuel executives (and disproportionately impacts the health of working-class families). Certainly helping coal communities is never prioritized over, say, high-end tax cuts. At least miners get to appear as props in political rallies, though.\nAnd all the while, Trump just keeps lying to them. The whole GOP does. More than a few Democrats, too.\nWhatever solutions might benefit coal communities, surely it must begin with telling them the truth: US coal is not coming back. Coal jobs are not coming back. Imposing more pollution on already-suffering communities won\u2019t change that.\n\nThe only way forward is through investment in regional economic diversification and development. It will be a hard road \u2014 new industries and opportunities will not grow as fast as coal fell \u2014 but it is the only road. Waiting for coal to come back is about as fruitful as waiting for the South to rise again.\nIt\u2019s time for these communities to hear the truth from those they trust.

He swore to stand up to the pharmaceutical companies, long revered as among Washington\u2019s powerful interests. He told Time, in his Person of the Year interview in December 2016: \u201cI\u2019m going to bring down drug prices. I don\u2019t like what has happened with drug prices.\u201d\nUnder Trump, drug companies have undertaken a concerted campaign to shift the discussion about drug prices to a conversation about out-of-pocket costs, in which health insurers and pharmacy benefits managers are under the microscope. \nThe companies\u2019 campaign appears to have borne fruit, judging by regulatory changes being pursued by the Trump administration on Medicare. Trump has also filled the executive branch with officials closely tied to the drug industry; his new pick to lead Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, was most recently a top executive at Eli Lilly. \nAs Azar was sworn into office Monday, Trump promised again that he would bring prescription drug prices \u201cway down.\u201d But experts say that in first year of Trump\u2019s presidency the drug industry has gained the upper hand in the lobbying campaign against its foes in the health care industry.\n\u201cI think they think they had a good year. They dodged a bullet,\u201d Len Nichols, a health policy professor at George Mason University, told me. \u201cI think of the pharmaceutical pricing issue as somewhat of a titanic struggle between pharma and the plans. If you think of it that way, in the Trump administration, pharma won Round 1.\u201d\nTrump promised repeatedly during the campaign he would bring down drug prices\nTrump was in many ways unlike any candidate \u2014 particularly any Republican \u2014 who came before him. Exhibit A: his promise to bring down drug prices. Back in January 2016, he was arguing that Medicare should be directly negotiating the prices it pays for medications and blaming the lobbying power of the drug companies for preventing it.\nIt was a position far closer to that of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), an avowed democratic socialist, than a more conventional Republican like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. But Trump was on firm populist ground. Fresh off the outrage over \u201cpharma bro\u201d Martin Shkreli, alleged price-gouging by his former company Valeant Pharmaceuticals, and groundbreaking but costly hepatitis C drugs, the public had named drug prices as their No. 1 priority for American health care in late 2015.\nThat furor hasn\u2019t faded much in the intervening months. Last spring, the Kaiser Family Foundation again found drug costs right near the top of the public\u2019s priorities.\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Kaiser Family Foundation\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nTrump viscerally tapped into that anger, and he stuck with the issue throughout the 2016 campaign. Advocating for a big-government approach to lowering drug costs put him at odds with the Republican Party but in line with what Americans say they want.\nHe wasn\u2019t afraid to use the most vivid rhetoric at his disposal to describe the ills of the pharmaceutical industry.\n\u201cThey\u2019re getting away with murder,\u201d Trump told reporters in January 2017, picking up on the exact language Sanders had used during the Democratic primary. \u201cPharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power.\u201d\nCandidate Trump was onto something very real: Americans do spend more per person on drugs than any other country in the world. As health insurance plans shift to higher out-of-pocket costs for their customers, people feel more and more of that burden.\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Sarah Kliff/Vox\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nHopes were high among the advocates working to lower drug prices. The industry was skittish. The stage was set for a showdown.\nDrug prices haven\u2019t been a priority for Trump\u2019s White House\nBut a big fight over drug prices never materialized. Instead, the Trump administration has been successfully courted in many ways by the pharmaceutical industry.\nThe industry was already launching its bold counteroffensive in the pricing debate: Three days after Trump was sworn into office, the trade association PhRMA announced a new advertising campaign to rebrand drug makers as leaders in medical innovation. \nThe campaign would have happened no matter who was in the White House, and PhRMA\u2019s new president, Steve Ubl, has marshaled a new strategy at the group, seeking to more directly engage in the debate, industry officials say. The industry association took steps to rid itself of some bad actors too. There was, to some extent, a legitimate response to the shifting public discourse about drug prices.\nBut there was no guaranteeing what kind of audience pharma would find in President Trump, given what he had said before he took office. During his first month in office, several top pharma executives met with the new president at the White House.\nComing out of that meeting, Trump was using language that sounded much more familiar \u2014 and much more comfortable \u2014 to drug companies. He was talking about increasing competition and lightening the regulatory burden to get drugs approved. \n\u201cThere has been an education of Mr. Trump,\u201d one top industry insider told me. \u201cTo where the real costs are, to the impact of other players in the system, and to the cost benefits of medicine in the system.\u201d\n\u201cIt was important,\u201d this person said of the White House meeting. \u201cThe CEOs showed respect to the president. They came, they sat around the table, they were chastened by his comments. ... It began a pathway of sincere dialogue. \u2018Okay, you wanna talk? Let\u2019s talk.\u2019\u201d\n(Another sign of the times: When Trump rubbed shoulders with the global elite in Davos, Switzerland, last week, two top drug executives got a seat at the White House\u2019s private dinner.)\nTrump\u2019s campaign pledge to have Medicare directly negotiate drug prices never seriously resurfaced after that meeting. A promised executive order on drug prices never materialized; Politico reported in June that a list of the possible policy changes that had been pulled together \u201cinclude[d] policies that read like gifts to the drug industry.\u201d\nTrump selected an industry-favored nominee to lead the Food and Drug Administration, Scott Gottlieb. After his first health secretary was forced to step down amid a scandal over charter jet travel, the president turned to Azar, who oversaw drug pricing at Eli Lilly for years, to lead the agency. \nWhile Gottlieb has earned praise for the work he has done at the FDA to increase competition, and Azar will enter HHS having pledged to do more on drug prices, they are nonetheless far afield from Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric. They have never signed on to the policies that Trump pushed as a candidate. \nAzar took a far more nuanced tone than his boss in his Senate confirmation hearing, noting that private Medicare Part D plans already do negotiate prices themselves, while cracking open the door \u2014 but hardly rushing through it \u2014 for tweaking other parts of Medicare to address drug costs.\n\u201cWhen populism meets reality, reality usually wins,\u201d Kim Monk, who tracks health policy for investors at Capital Alpha, told me. \u201cThe folks he\u2019s brought in tend to be free market folks, industry folks who don\u2019t like the government negotiating drug prices because they don\u2019t believe it would work.\u201d\nThe discussion about drug \u201cprices\u201d isn\u2019t about prices anymore\nTrump\u2019s promises coming into office were unambiguous: He wanted to bring down drug prices, and he planned to confront the pharmaceutical industry directly. But a year later, the discussion about drug prices has shifted to something else. \nThe spotlight has been turned on health plans, for structuring benefits so that customers are paying more out of pocket for medications. Scrutiny is also on pharmacy benefits managers, the mysterious third parties that often oversee drug transactions and take a cut of the profits for themselves.\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Carolyn Y. Johnson meticulously documented how the drug industry has successfully put its industry adversaries under the microscope in the price debate. It\u2019s been a campaign with millions of dollars and hundreds of hours of lobbying manpower behind it. \nThe drug industry is happy to take the credit for the paradigm shift, arguing that the campaign has had resonance because it highlights a real problem \u2014 the byzantine infrastructure that helps inflates drug costs.\n\u201cWe have been part of an education effort to broaden the bull\u2019s-eye,\u201d the industry insider told me. \u201cI want people to know as much as possible about where their health care dollars go.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a net win for drug companies. \u201cI think pharma is very happy to have the policy debate turn to the distribution chain,\u201d Monk said.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s agenda has reflected this new orientation. HHS has proposed changes to Medicare that would cut down on practices used by health plans disparaged by pharmaceutical companies. Those practices include not counting assistance that drugmakers provide to their customers toward the out-of-pocket maximum that Americans with private Medicare Part D plans are required to pay. \nThe administration is also reviewing changes to another federal program that gives certain hospitals a mandated discount on drug prices, which drug companies have long said is exploited by hospitals without benefiting patients. \nAt the FDA, Gottlieb has been praised by all sides for the steps his agency has taken to encourage more generic competition: The agency approved 1,000 generics in 2017. But that is an area where drugmakers have said they are willing to compromise \u2014 because they prefer to make it easier for cheaper generic drugs to come to the market than to have more direct government intervention.\n\u201cScott is quite sincere and doing what he can on the generic competition,\u201d Nichols said, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much nice little window dressing around the edges.\u201d\nThese are all real issues, experts say: Health plans and pharmacy benefits managers do share some of the blame for the high costs that Americans are paying out of pocket. Increased generic competition should do something to help get more cheap drugs on the market. The hospitals drug program might be in need of more scrutiny.\nBut they all have something else in common: They aren\u2019t about the list prices that pharmaceutical companies set when they introduce a new drug. Lowering the out-of-pocket costs that normal people feel is worthwhile, Walid Gellad, a co-director at the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh, told me. But that won\u2019t bring down the gross costs of prescription drugs.\nAnd as long as those costs remain high, somebody is going to pay the bill. Health insurers could be required to reduce what some people pay out of pocket for medicine, but if they are, then they will simply raise premiums on everybody to make up for it.\n\u201cEverybody still talks about drug prices, but most of the time, they\u2019re talking about the cost sharing for drugs,\u201d Gellad said. \u201cThe efforts that we\u2019ve seen so far are meant to reduce what people pay, but they\u2019re not going to reduce drug prices.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re just going to raise premiums, or try to offset it another way,\u201d he said of insurance plans. \u201cSomeone\u2019s gonna pay the price if the price doesn\u2019t come down.\u201d\nSo the systematic problems are still there \u2014 though pharma would counter that their medicines provide a unique value to the health care system, keeping costs down over the long term, and dismiss critics who they say won\u2019t be satisfied unless the industry takes a direct hit. \nBut the point is: Nobody, especially President Trump, is really talking about prices anymore.\n\u201cPatient out-of-pocket costs are certainly a problem that needs to be addressed,\u201d Sachs said, \u201cbut it can\u2019t be the solution to drug pricing.\u201d\nPharma is trying to behave itself \u2014 sort of \u2014 to avoid Trump\u2019s wrath\nAllergan CEO Brent Saunders famously promised in fall 2016, before Trump\u2019s win but while drug prices were still the dominant health care issue, that his company would not raise any list prices higher than 10 percent as part of a \u201csocial contract.\u201d\nOther companies have done the same. Long frustrated that industry outsiders like Shkreli have given their sector a bad name, the big-time pharmaceutical firms have been doing what they can to avoid bad headlines and risk bringing Trump\u2019s ferocious anger back down on them.\n\u201cThe restraint, I think, is because the industry\u2019s savvy and they\u2019re not tone-deaf to the tenor of things,\u201d the industry insider told me. \u201cNobody is smarter than the people in this industry. It\u2019s not a cynical view. It\u2019s the opposite. They are not going to do stupid, self-destructive things.\u201d\nIn other words, the pharmaceutical industry is hoping to stay out of the headlines \u2014 and Trump\u2019s Twitter feed \u2014 by keeping their price hikes in check.  Just this month, drugmakers announced a new spate of price hikes, but they largely stayed within that 10 percent limit, Reuters reported. \nIt\u2019s smart politics for the drug industry, but experts warn against creating a new status quo where 10 percent raises are seen as the norm \u2014 or, worse, as restraint.\n\u201cIf we say it\u2019s okay to have single-digit price increases, we\u2019re saying it\u2019s okay for a price to double in seven or eight years. No one should think that that\u2019s okay, or that\u2019s self-policing,\u201d Gellad said. \u201cThe idea that high-single-digit price increases are somehow okay is mind-boggling.\u201d\nIt also gives the false impression that list prices are the only way drug companies can pad their profits.\nAllergan \u2014 the trendsetter on self-imposed limits on price increases \u2014 got into trouble with a federal judge late last year for trying to sell its expiring patents on some of its drugs to a Native American tribe to extend the life of the patent and maintain its monopoly on the drugs for a while longer, which would bring in millions of dollars in additional revenue.\nThe convoluted scheme never attracted the same level of outrage as Martin Shkreli or the price hikes for EpiPens and insulin, perhaps because it dealt with the minutiae of US patent law, an area essential for pharmaceutical firms but far more impenetrable to the average American than tripling a drug\u2019s price.\nThe Trump presidency isn\u2019t over, of course, not by a long shot. Industry officials are still on guard after his vitriolic entry into office.\nRight now, HHS is actually reviewing a waiver for Massachusetts to allow its Medicaid program to more aggressively restrict access to certain drugs as a negotiating tactic with drugmakers. How the administration responds could signal whether it is willing to take steps to deliver on Trump\u2019s promises. \nBut so far, Trump is taking it easy on pharma.\n\u201cThey want to lower drug prices without hurting the industry\u2019s revenue,\u201d Gellad said. \u201cEverything the administration has done so far seems to fall in that category.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Tara Golshan", "body": "On Wednesday, the White House released a statement expressing President Donald Trump\u2019s support for the omnibus, a $1.3 trillion funding package that would majorly boost military and domestic programs. Thirty-six hours later, Trump was threatening to veto the bill and shut down the government over Twitter.\n\nHe ultimately didn\u2019t follow through, begrudgingly signing the omnibus Friday afternoon. But the apparent break down in the intervening hours opened a window into the Republican Party\u2019s strategy with Trump: how congressional leaders try to keep business moving as usual under an extremely unusual \u2014 and often unpredictable \u2014 president.\n\nTo a degree, Trump\u2019s frustrations with the spending bill were understandable; the final spending package ignored most of the White House\u2019s hardline immigration agenda. It reined in funding for immigrant detention facilities, didn\u2019t defund so-called \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d and barely touched the border wall. Yet again, the deep ideological division between the White House and Republicans on Capitol Hill had reared its head.\n\nBut for nearly a day, House Speaker Paul Ryan sold Trump on everything else: a bill that would boost military spending, address the opioid crisis, and even put $1.6 billion toward border wall funding (the part about how all that money came with a lot of restrictions was likely left out of the pitch). \n\nThis is a story about how Republican leaders nearly failed to execute what has become a road-tested strategy with Trump: keeping him from reality.\n\nTrump gave in this time. But he had a warning for Congress: \u201cNever again.\u201d\n\nRepublicans had to spin the spending bill not just for voters, but for Trump\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had been dispatched to sell the president on the spending bill. It was a success.\n\n\u201cThe President and the leaders discussed their support for the bill, which includes more funds to rebuild the military, such as the largest pay raise for our troops in a decade, more than 100 miles of new construction for the border wall and other key domestic priorities,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders released in a statement shortly after the meeting. \n\nThat night, Trump declared victory on Twitter: He had won $1.6 billion in border wall funding and the biggest budget for the military in history. He griped about having to make wasteful spending concessions to Democrats, but it seemed like water under the bridge.\n\nThe next morning, Ryan went on Fox  Friends \u2014 one of Trump\u2019s favorite morning shows, which he often live-tweets \u2014 reaffirming the president\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cThis is the Trump-Jim Mattis budget for the military,\u201d Ryan said on air. \u201cThis funds the wall, fixes the military, fights opioids, does the things that we said and does not fund Gateway \u2014 gives Donald Trump the decision on Gateway.\u201d\n\nThe strategy became clear: focus Trump on the military spending. Repeat the $1.6 billion number. \n\nThe reality, of course, was very different. \n\nSure, the spending bill does include some border wall funding \u2014 $1.6 billion worth (which is much less than the $25 billion the White House asked for) \u2014 but it comes with a lot of strings attached; most of the funding will have to go toward repairing existing fencing or toward double fencing where barriers already exist. In other words, this isn\u2019t money for Trump\u2019s big, beautiful wall. Overall, the spending bill largely dismissed Trump\u2019s immigration agenda.\n\nYes, the $900 million infrastructure spending proposal for Gateway, a commuter rail and tunnel proposal connecting New York and New Jersey, which Trump threatened to veto the spending bill over, was left out \u2014 but there was more than $500 million in grants and Amtrak funding that could be allocated toward Gateway without the Department of Transportation\u2019s stamp of approval.\n\nHow the \u201cTrump-Jim Mattis budget\u201d became the \u201cswamp budget\u201d\nRyan wasn\u2019t on Fox  Friends Friday morning, and it showed. They had a very different message about the spending bill.\n\nThe omnibus was no longer the \u201cTrump-Jim Mattis budget\u201d for the military. It was the \u201cswamp budget.\u201d Fox contributor Pete Hegseth called it a \u201cMitch McConnell special.\u201d He said there was \u201cno wall\u201d and that Democrats had taken over the process in the Senate.\n\n\n\nOn Fox  Friends this morning, Pete Hegseth said of the omnibus, \"this is a swamp budget, this is a Mitch McConnell special,\" savaged it because \"no wall.\" pic.twitter.com/tTAIWj5til\n\u2014 Matthew Gertz (@MattGertz) March 23, 2018\n\n\n\n\nWe can\u2019t say for sure that Trump was watching Friday morning. But that\u2019s almost beside the point. The departure from Republican leaders\u2019 spin was a show of the deep ideological divides within the Republican Party. Conservatives overwhelmingly came out against this spending bill for liberal spending on domestic programs and a lack of policy wins. It didn\u2019t defund Planned Parenthood or sanctuary cities, and it didn\u2019t prioritize school choice.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus, a group of the House\u2019s most conservative lawmakers, called it an \u201cinsult to America\u2019s taxpayers, as well as their many rank-and-file representatives who had no say in the omnibus negotiations.\u201d Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) a deficit hawk, called it \u201cgrotesque,\u201d and Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) took it one step further, saying the bill was a \u201cgreat-dane-sized whiz down the leg of every taxpayer in this country.\u201d \n\nAnd as Vox reported last week, the White House, which often espouses the views of Congress\u2019s most conservative hardliners, had increasingly grown dissatisfied with the spending bill over immigration. Trump officials had even been back-channeling conservative ideas with conservative allies on Capitol Hill. Needless to say, Trump\u2019s base wasn\u2019t going to like this spending bill.\n\nBy Friday morning, reality had set in once again. At 8:55 am, Trump was threatening a veto.\n\n\n\nI am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\n\u2014 Donald J.

At the same conference, he repeated the words \u201cno collusion\u201d seven times in a single answer. \nThis week, CNN reported that Trump still remains unconvinced Russia interfered in the 2016 election.\nThere\u2019s more\nCNBC on Friday listed multiple instances of Trump\u2019s public doubting of Russian interference in US politics. Add to the list above the following:\n\nIn April 2017, Trump told John Dickerson on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation it\u2019s hard to figure out who\u2019s responsible for hacking. \u201cKnowing something about hacking, if you don\u2019t catch a hacker, okay, in the act, it\u2019s very hard to say who did the hacking,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWith that being said, I\u2019ll go along with Russia. It could have been China. It could have been a lot of different groups.\u201d In the same interview, he called collusion allegations a \u201cphony story\u201d and said he didn\u2019t know if the Russian meddling story was, too.\nTrump has repeatedly called Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into what happened in the 2016 election \u2014 and into the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with a foreign power \u2014 a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 18, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues, two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold, Democrats and Russians!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 23, 2017\n\n\n\nThe president has also asked why the Obama administration didn\u2019t do more if Russia was really interfering in the 2016 election. \u201cWhy did the White House wait so long to act?\u201d he tweeted in December 2016, as president-elect.\n\n\nIf Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 15, 2016\n\n\n\nMost of Trump\u2019s criticism of the Russia investigation has focused on collusion, which the president has spent a lot of time denying. (Part of the White House\u2019s response to Mueller\u2019s Friday indictments of Russian companies and individuals literally included the words \u201cNO COLLUSION.\u201d) But to say that Trump never doubted the entire Russia interference story is a lie. Call it fake news.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Andrew Prokop", "body": "Special Counsel Robert Mueller is close to flipping another former Trump staffer. \nRick Gates \u2014 Paul Manafort\u2019s longtime junior business partner, and a 2016 Trump campaign staffer \u2014 is \u201cfinalizing\u201d a plea deal in which he\u2019d cooperate with the Mueller investigation, CNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz and Sara Murray report. Gates has been in negotiations with Mueller\u2019s team about cooperating for over a month, their report says, citing sources familiar with the case. \nBack in October, Mueller\u2019s team indicted Gates and Manafort on a combined 12 counts that mostly focused on alleged money laundering, failure to disclose financial assets, and false statements regarding their work for the government of Ukraine and a Russia-affiliated Ukrainian political party \u2014 matters that didn\u2019t have anything specific to do with Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. (Both pleaded not guilty.)\nBut apparently, Mueller didn\u2019t intend to stop there. The special counsel\u2019s team had prepared superseding indictments that would add to or replace the original charges against both Manafort and Gates, per an earlier CNN report. Facing an expensive legal defense with no end in sight, Gates signed a new lawyer who has been working on cutting him a plea deal.\nThe biggest question, though, is whether Gates\u2019s possible flip is mainly bad news for Paul Manafort concerning those lobbying and money laundering charges ... or whether it would have even bigger implications for the investigation into Russian interference as a whole, and into President Trump specifically.\nBecause if Manafort were to know of anything that could implicate Trump in connection with Russia, it seems quite plausible Gates would know it too.\nWho is Rick Gates?\nBasically, Gates is Paul Manafort\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and right hand man, who was at his side during his past decade of lobbying and foreign work, before going with him to join the Trump campaign.\nManafort, who is two decades older than Gates, had worked for Republican politicians, controversial dictators, and corporate interests before his career took a turn in the mid-2000s. He \u201call but vanished from the Washington scene\u201d and began focusing on business activities in Eastern Europe, as Politico later reported. \nThis began with advising work for the Russian oligarch and aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, and soon moved into the political realm with advising work for the Party of Regions \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian political party \u2014 and its leader, Viktor Yanukovych. \nGates joined Manafort\u2019s firm in 2006 and began managing much of its Eastern Europe portfolio soon afterward, often working out of Kiev, according to the New York Times. In particular, Gates was to run a new private equity company called Pericles that Manafort was starting, to fund investments in Ukraine and Russia.\nBut in recent years, these business ventures went awry. President Yanukovych was forced to flee Ukraine due to protests and clashes over his pro-Russian policies. Pericles, meanwhile, collapsed in a messy legal battle, as Deripaska, its leading funder,  accused Manafort and Gates of cheating him of millions. (An essential recent profile of Manafort by Franklin Foer in the Atlantic has more details on the pair\u2019s Ukrainian work.)\nThen, as part of an effort from Donald Trump to professionalize his presidential campaign, he brought Manafort aboard in March 2016. With Manafort came Gates. And as the original campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, saw his star fall, Manafort\u2019s portfolio gradually expanded until he was effectively running the whole operation. In mid-May, Manafort was officially named campaign chair and chief strategist. \nThough Trump fired Manafort in August 2016, Gates stayed on with the campaign through the general election, and later served on Trump\u2019s inaugural committee and worked at a pro-Trump outside group until March 2017.\nWhat was Rick Gates was indicted for?\nOn October 30, 2017, in the first public indictments of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Manafort and Gates were charged with a total of 12 counts.\nThe gist of the charges was that Manafort and Gates \u201cacted as unregistered agents\u201d of the government of Ukraine and Ukrainian politicians, generating \u201ctens of millions of dollars in income\u201d which they then \u201claundered\u201d through \u201cscores of United States and foreign corporations, partnerships, and bank accounts.\u201d You can read the full indictment here.\nIt\u2019s helpful to think of the charges in two separate but related buckets: one is money laundering, and the second is false statements or failure to disclosure foreign work.\nOn the money laundering front, Manafort and Gates were both charged with a broader \u201cconspiracy to launder money\u201d and separate specific charges on their failure to report foreign bank and financial accounts.\nThen there are the false statements and failure to disclose charges. They are:\n\nActing as an unregistered agent of the government of Ukraine, its then president and one of its major political parties.\nMaking false and misleading statements under the Foreign Agents Registration Act related to that Ukraine work.\n\nNow, these charges don\u2019t necessarily seem to have anything to do with potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia \u2014 Mueller\u2019s main investigative job. \nBut he likely saw these separate charges against Manafort and Gates as a means to this end. The stronger the evidence he has against either or both of them, the more pressure he can exert to get them to cooperate in the probe into Russian interference.\nWould Gates be flipping just on Manafort \u2014 or on Trump?\nGates is far younger than Manafort (he\u2019s only 45 years old), and he has young children. So though Gates pleaded not guilty, speculation almost immediately began over whether he might flip to avoid a long prison sentence. \nThe big question, though, is just what this flipping might entail \u2014 and whom Gates might implicate.\nIt is possible that Gates\u2019s cooperation would primarily be useful to Mueller as a means to pressure Manafort further. After all, Gates certainly has in-depth knowledge about Manafort\u2019s activities over the past decade-plus. His cooperation could make it easier to make a case against Manafort \u2014 or to get Manafort himself to flip.\nBut there are other possibilities as well.\nAfter all, Gates worked on the Trump campaign. And unlike his fellow cooperator George Papadopoulos, he actually had a high-level job there which had him work quite closely with the person running the campaign for several months: Manafort.\nFor instance, there have been recent reports that Mueller is keenly interested in the White House\u2019s story about the June 9, 2016 meeting Donald Trump Jr. arranged with a Russian lawyer in Trump Tower for purposes of getting dirt on Hillary Clinton.\nGates wasn\u2019t at that meeting \u2014 but Manafort was. And if anything inappropriate involving Russian interference with the campaign did happen there, one person Manafort just might tell could be his close friend and business partner of over a decade, Rick Gates.\nThat is to say that, while Gates\u2019s potential cooperation could just be about providing information on Manafort\u2019s business, it\u2019s not out of the question that it\u2019s about providing information on potential collusion with Russia. \nIt is also worth noting that Mueller has also looked closely into events during the transition period after Trump won but before he was sworn in. And while Gates didn\u2019t officially work on the transition, he worked as the deputy chair of Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, so he was in the president-elect\u2019s orbit at the time.\nSo if Gates does flip, the bigger picture is that Mueller would then three former Trump aides \u2014 that we know of \u2014 cooperating and providing him with information. If criminal collusion did happen, that would put the special counsel in a better position than ever to uncover it.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Alex Ward", "body": "Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have concluded their year-long investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Their key finding: Neither President Donald Trump nor anyone involved in his campaign colluded with Russia. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found no evidence of collusion,\u201d Rep. Mike Conaway (R-TX), the leader of the committee\u2019s investigation, told reporters on Monday, adding that there was \u201cperhaps some bad judgment, inappropriate meetings, inappropriate judgment at taking meetings,\u201d but nothing that amounted to a coordinated and deliberate effort to work with Russians to win the White House. \n\n\u201c[O]nly Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn or someone else like that could take these series of inadvertent contacts with each other, meetings, whatever, and weave that into some sort of a fiction and turn it into a page-turner, spy thriller,\u201d Conaway said.\n\nHe also said that while Republicans on the committee agree that Russia did interfere in the 2016 presidential election, they \u201cdisagree with the narrative that they were trying to help Trump.\u201d \n\nThat directly contradicts the US intelligence community assessment from January 2017, which clearly states that Russia wanted Trump to win. It also contradicts special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s indictment of 13 Russians for working to help Trump win by sowing divisions via the Internet.\n\nNone of this is likely to satisfy Democrats on the committee, who have consistently argued that Republicans had no real intention of finding out the truth. For example, Democrats claim Republicans didn\u2019t use the full power of the committee to subpoena documents or compel further testimony that key witnesses withheld from investigators. \n\nCommittee Democrats also say that Republicans on the committee never interviewed key witnesses including former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and Manafort\u2019s associate Rick Gates \u2014 all of whom special counsel Robert Mueller has indicted in his investigation. \n\nAccording to CNN, Conaway hadn\u2019t told Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the committee\u2019s top Democrat, on Monday that Republicans concluded the investigation.\n\nThat, and today\u2019s surprise announcement, underscores the just how dysfunctional and hyperpartisan the committee has functioned throughout the entire process.\n\nExpect even more partisanship\nThis is the same committee that produced two divergent and high-profile memos earlier this year addressing alleged abuses by federal law enforcement against the Trump campaign. \n\nThe so-called \u201cNunes memo,\u201d drafted by close ally of President Donald Trump, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), claimed the FBI illegally surveilled a low-level Trump foreign policy adviser. In response, Schiff, Nunes\u2019s counterpart on the committee, wrote his own memo rebutting Nunes\u2019s account point by point. \n\nThe drama surrounding the differing accounts led to a public, partisan fight about whether or not the FBI is politically biased against Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the Democrats will choose to release their own report, contradicting the GOP\u2019s effort. In other words, expect that yawning partisan gap to widen even further. \n\nRepublicans, who will show their 150-page report to Democrats on Tuesday, will likely use their report as fodder for their campaign to protect Trump. In fact, they might even use it to further delegitimize \u2014 and demonize \u2014 special counsel Robert Mueller probe into Trump-Russia collusion. (Recall: Mueller is the only one that can actually bring criminal charges against the president; the House Intelligence Committee looked into Russia\u2019s interference during the election.) \n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, will say there\u2019s more to investigate due to ample evidence of collusion \u2014 but that Republicans chose to obstruct the probe instead.\n\nThat means there\u2019s really one last hope for a bipartisan effort on the Trump-Russia issue: the Senate Intelligence Committee. A Senate aide confirmed to Vox that the Senate committee will continue to interview witnesses and review documents. The committee\u2019s chairman, Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC), has yet to announce any intention conclude the interviews phase.\n\nTo date, Burr\u2019s committee has largely worked in a bipartisan fashion to complete its probe. But it\u2019s unclear if that bonhomie will continue after the GOP report is made public.\n\nIn effect, Conaway\u2019s announcement threatens to make the already politically charged probe even more politically charged \u2014 which could lead into a further breakdown in congressional decorum.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Rachel Wolfe", "body": "Is the government secretly being controlled by an unelected group of officials \u2014 a so-called \u201cdeep state\u201d? The majority of the country seems to think so, according to a Monmouth University poll released Monday. \n\nOnce thought of as the domain of conspiracy theorists (and, later, the president of the United States) the perception of unelected officials having undue influence has gone mainstream. Seventy-four percent of respondents said the deep state, \u201ca group of unelected government and military officials who secretly manipulate or direct national policy,\u201d \u201cdefinitely\u201d or \u201cprobably\u201d exists.\n\nOnly 37 percent of Americans said they were at least \u201csomewhat familiar\u201d with the term \u201cdeep state.\u201d However, given the description, 27 percent said the deep state definitely exists and 47 percent saying it probably exists. \n\nBefore bringing up the question of the Deep State, Monmouth University asked respondents whether unelected officials in Washington as a whole had too much power.

Trump has largely outsourced his agenda to the congressional GOP and their allies inside his administration. As a result, he has pursued policies similar to what Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz or Jeb Bush might have pursued: repeal of Obamacare, tax cuts for corporations, deregulation for the energy industry. When he goes to Davos \u2014 and, note, he goes to Davos! \u2014 he gives the kind of speech any Republican might give at Davos. \nIdeologically disruptive forces like Steve Bannon have been forcibly ejected from Trump\u2019s orbit, and the president himself has abandoned his more heterodox views on taxes, trade, health care, and China. Trump remains an immigration hardliner, but of a sort that has long been represented within the Republican Party. \nTrump\u2019s opponents can take comfort in their success at resisting and wounding this incarnation of Trump\u2019s White House. Given the economy\u2019s performance and the GOP\u2019s dominance of Congress, it is surprising how little the Trump administration has achieved, and how steep the price has been. The effort to repeal Obamacare was a debacle. The tax cuts passed, but they passed while polling in the 20s and 30s \u2014 a disaster given that the policy, at least in its early years, is designed to shovel free money at families and corporations. \nA comparison of Gallup tracking polls shows the severity of the GOP\u2019s problems: At about this point in Obama\u2019s presidency, with a brutal 9.9 percent unemployment rate, 50 percent of the country approved of Obama\u2019s job performance; Trump, with a 4.1 percent unemployment rate, is polling at 39 percent. The toxicity is spreading through Trump\u2019s party too: Democrats are up by more than 7 percentage points in polls asking Americans whom they will support in the next congressional election. \n\u201cHe is a highly divisive figure,\u201d says George Edwards, a political scientist at Texas AM who studies presidential rhetoric. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t convince anyone on the other side. He doesn\u2019t move the public. He cannot reach out beyond people already committed to him.\u201d\nBut there is another Trump presidency \u2014 that of Donald J. Trump, reality television star and international brand. This is the presidency that I suspect matters more to Trump himself, the one that he pursues during his morning \u201cexecutive time,\u201d the one he furthers with every tweet, the one he obsessively monitors on cable news. This is the presidency for which the measures of achievement aren\u2019t bills passed or jobs created but headlines grabbed and mindshare held. \nThis is the presidency that, for all its collateral damage, is succeeding beyond Trump\u2019s wildest dreams. This is the presidency that few have figured out how to resist. \nTrump\u2019s law: attention creates value\nThe secret to Trump\u2019s success, the insight that has separated him from his competitors, is that he has cared less about the nature of the coverage he received than that he received coverage at all. \n\u201cEven a critical story, which may be hurtful personally, can be very valuable to your business,\u201d Trump said in his 1987 book The Art of the Deal. He goes on to recall the lesson he learned being attacked for a particularly gaudy skyscraper he sought to build. \u201cThe point,\u201d he says, \u201cis that we got a lot of attention, and that alone creates value.\u201d\nThis is the law by which Trump lives his life. Attention creates value, at least for him. Before Trump, every politician hewed to the same basic rule: You want as much positive coverage, and as little negative coverage, as possible. Trump upended that. \nHis rule, his realization, is that you want as much coverage as possible, full stop. If it\u2019s positive coverage, great. If it\u2019s negative coverage, so be it. The point is that it\u2019s coverage \u2014 that you\u2019re the story, that you\u2019re squeezing out your competitors, that you\u2019re on people\u2019s minds. \nThis was Trump\u2019s true political innovation: He realized that presidential campaigns \u2014 and particularly presidential primaries \u2014 had become reality shows, and the path to victory was to get the most attention, even if much of that attention was negative.\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nIn this, Trump either intuited or stumbled into a profound insight about the media: It\u2019s easier to get bad press than good press. There is an old line about the media: We don\u2019t cover the planes that land safely. Most politicians try to get media coverage while landing the plane safely. They stage photo ops at factories, give prepared statements, deliver carefully crafted speeches. The result is dull, predictable, normal \u2014 and ignored. \nTrump dominates news cycle after news cycle by crashing planes into Twitter. He is everywhere, seemingly all the time. He says things no national politician in history would have dared say, things that the press covers because they are outrageous, controversial, unnerving, appalling. \nTrump is demanding and receiving our attention, crowding out everything else, accepting that it\u2019s better to be hated than to be ignored.\n\u201cThere is a range of Trump coverage and attention that a conventional politician would find devastating that Trump finds exhilarating,\u201d says Ron Klain, who served as chief of staff to Vice Presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden.  \nEvery so often, someone will suggest that we just ignore Trump\u2019s words, his riffs, his tweets. But Trump controls a nuclear arsenal. His tweets are \u201cconsidered official statements by the president of the United States,\u201d according to Sean Spicer, who served as Trump\u2019s first press secretary. \nThese are words that start wars, that drive deportations, that set policy, that end negotiations, that empower bigots, that reveal scandals, that represent our country. That the president of the United States is acting outrageously, or worryingly, or offensively, is important. As much as Trump might treat his presidency like a reality show, it remains a presidency, and lives are in the balance.\nYet in owning our attention, in driving the agenda, in setting both the terms and tone of the debate, and in doing so by generating constant negative attention, cultural conflict, and emotional alarm, Trump makes us a little more like him, and politics a little more like the tribal clash he says it is.\nTrump is winning. The country is losing. \nTwo weeks ago, Trump, after much fanfare, held his \u201cFake News Awards.\u201d He had teased the event on Twitter for weeks, sending journalists into paroxysms of mockery and frustration. This was, as so much is with Trump, an exercise that was simultaneously ridiculous and dangerous, comic and illiberal. The \u201cawards\u201d turned out to be complaints about stories Trump had already complained about, tied to a fundraising plea for the Republican Party. \nIn response, many in the media played into his hands, joking that it was an honor just to be considered, lamenting that they didn\u2019t win, acting out of anger and exhaustion more like the opposition party he says we are.\n\u201cIt says so much about our current media moment that the president would announce plans to shame news organizations with his first-annual \u2018Fake News Awards\u2019 and every reporter would be praying to God they made the list,\u201d wrote Kyle Pope, the editor of the Columbia Journalism Review. \nTrump drives his opponents to respond in kind, to adopt just a little more of his tone and language and pitch. Twitter swells with jabs and nicknames, cries of \u201cSad!\u201d and \u201cFake news!\u201d Even when it doesn\u2019t succumb to that behavior, the media is laser-focused on Trump\u2019s words, behavior, decisions, grievances. America ends up having the fights Trump wants us to have.\nTrump understands this power. He knows he can wrest the news cycle back at a moment\u2019s notice. In September, amidst Puerto Rico\u2019s misery and bad news for the GOP\u2019s congressional agenda, Trump lashed out at kneeling NFL protestors, creating a multi-week firestorm that didn\u2019t have policy stakes, but drove a deep wedge into our cultural divisions. \n\n\nSports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017\n\n\n\nThe whole episode was, again, a mixture the surreal and the scary. Here was the President of the United States choosing to ignite a racialized controversy, telling the mostly white attendees at his rallies that \u201cpeople like yourselves\u201d shouldn\u2019t have to see \u201cthose people\u201d kneeling during the anthem. Trump sent Vice President Mike Pence to an NFL game with instructions to walk out if the players kneeled \u2014 which was exactly what happened. It was a transparent effort to distract us, to inflame our divisions, to lure us to have the fight Trump wanted to have rather than continue discussing his flailing governance.\nAnd yet it worked. Coverage of this was everywhere \u2014 it dominated not just the political press, but also sports media. Trump\u2019s opponents were angry \u2014 the president was a racist, he was dismissing police brutality, he was turning us against each other. His supporters were indignant \u2014 the president was a patriot, he was defending the flag and the country. There were takes, late-night comedy bits, searching interviews, angry tweets, earnest explainers. \nBy the time Trump was done, the NFL, which had previously been viewed favorably by both Democratic and Republican voters, had become one of the most divisive brands in the US. Trump had successfully made us angrier at each other, he had absorbed more of American life into the tribalized war of our politics and he had done so on his terms. \nThe NFL skirmish was one of many clashes Trump caused during his first year in office. As this analysis from Echelon Insights shows, Trump dominated the national conversation on almost every day of 2017, and that was true no matter whether you looked at liberals or conservatives or political elites or everyone. The mindshare he occupies, the energy he consumes, is vast:\n\nI say none of this from atop a soapbox. I am as guilty of it as anyone, and more guilty of it than most. \nI find it hard to resist commenting on Trump\u2019s tweets. I find it hard to tear myself away from his daily outrages, even when I know they\u2019re less important than other things I could cover. I find it hard not to respond to him in kind, not to let his language, his energy, his approach, infect mine. \nBut there is a cost to this. \nPart of the cost is political. Trump sees the world as zero-sum tribal warfare, and the way he operates, the way he acts, the rage and fear and shock he calls forth in his opponents, makes it more so. As my colleague Matt Yglesias observes, this seems, on the margins, to work for Trump \u2014 his approval ratings rise slightly in periods in which the news is dominated by angry clashes over his behavior, and fall when the story turns back to the more ordinary outrages of his policy agenda.\nPart of the cost is social. Keeping politics at this pitch for four years is a terrible strain on an already divided country. Dozens of news stories have recorded psychologists reporting patients streaming into their office with Trump-related anxiety. Trump is deepening the threats we feel \u2014 and, in some cases, the threats we truly face \u2014 from each other; he is breaking us into warring factions in the hopes that that collision will strengthen his supporters\u2019 loyalty to him. \nSome of it is an opportunity cost \u2014 there are so many other conversations we could be having, so many other stories we could be covering. It is hard, amid Trump, to see beyond Trump \u2014 to the technological changes transforming our society, to the international forces reshaping our world, to the leaders and doers who are building a better future.\nThere is a section of Michael Wolff\u2019s Fire and Fury that has stuck with me. It speaks to the size of Trump\u2019s achievement, the unprecedented nature of his success, and it is true: \n\n[I]t might be a central tragedy of the news media that its old-fashioned and even benighted civic-minded belief that politics is the highest form of news has helped transform it from a mass business to a narrow-cast one. ... Politics has gone one way, the culture another. The left-right junkies might pretend otherwise, but the great middle doesn\u2019t put political concerns at the top of their minds. \nAnd yet, contravening all cultural and media logic, Donald Trump produced on a daily basis an astonishing, can\u2019t-stop-following-it narrative. And this was not even because he was changing or upsetting the fundamentals of American life. In six months as president, failing to master almost any aspect of the bureaucratic process, he had, beyond placing his nominee on the Supreme Court, accomplished, practically speaking, nothing. And yet, OMG!!! There almost was no other story in America \u2014  and in much of the world. That was the radical and transformational nature of the Trump presidency: it held everybody\u2019s attention. \n\nThis is, I think, Trump\u2019s true purpose in public life: to have everyone talking about him, looking at him, reacting to him. He cares more about his coverage than his impact; he is much more committed to what\u2019s said about him on Fox  Friends than what\u2019s written about him in the history books. Trump\u2019s Reality Show White House has been an unstoppable force, dominating our attention, coarsening our politics, making us angrier and more afraid and more distant from each other. In this, he\u2019s succeeding \u2014 winning, even.\nIt is easy to dismiss this dimension of Trump\u2019s presidency. Does it really matter if the president is heightening the conflicts in political life, if he is deepening our cultural divides, if he is activating and validating our tribal identities and hatreds every time he turns on his phone? It does. \nIn their book Why Washington Won\u2019t Work, political scientists March Hetherington and Thomas Rudolph identify trust as an essential component of functional political systems. The more we mistrust each other, the more we fear each other, the harder it is for politics to function, for politicians to justify compromise, for parties to accept the legitimacy of the other side. \n\u201cPartisans today are polarized not in their policy preferences but rather in their feelings about each other,\u201d write Hetherington and Rudolph. \u201cAs a result, political trust has polarized by party, leading to an absence of policy consensus and a gridlocked political system with little incentive to compromise.\u201d\nThis is a theme that Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt pick up in How Democracies Die:\nWhen parties view one another as mortal enemies, the stakes of political competition heighten dramatically. Losing ceases to be a routine and accepted part of the political process and instead becomes a full-blown catastrophe. When the perceived cost of losing is sufficiently high, politicians will be tempted to abandon forbearance. Acts of constitutional hardball may then in turn further undermine mutual toleration, reinforcing beliefs that our rivals pose a dangerous threat.\nEven before Trump, American politics was becoming dangerously angry, polarized, bitter. In this, Trump\u2019s rise is more symptom than cause. But his presidency has been an accelerant, and the consequences of it are yet untold.\nThere are three years left in Trump\u2019s term. It will not be good for the country if they all feel like Trump\u2019s first.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Dylan Scott", "body": "The next battle in the Republican civil war is taking shape in Mississippi.\n\nThere, in the deep South, 80-year-old Republican Sen. Thad Cochran is retiring after four decades in the Senate. He will soon be replaced by a new senator appointed by Gov. Phil Bryant, who has been in close contact with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell over the past few months as it became clear that Cochran\u2019s health would not allow him to serve much longer. Cochran\u2019s seat will be on the ballot in November \u2014 and hard-right conservatives have had their eye on Mississippi for months.\n\nCould it be Alabama all over again?\n\nWaiting in the wings is conservative insurgent Chris McDaniel, a former state senator with ties to the neo-Confederate movement, who was prepared to challenge Mississippi\u2019s other Republican senator at Steve Bannon\u2019s urging. But now he\u2019s running for Cochran\u2019s open seat.\n\nMcDaniel already challenged Cochran in a bitterly contested 2014 Republican primary  \u2014 it involved a break-in and a suicide \u2014 and to this day his supporters contend that election was stolen from him in part because many of the black voters in the state lined up behind Cochran. \n\nMcDaniel could triumph among Republicans. But his history of racially charged remarks in a state that is one-third black could make him vulnerable against a good Democratic candidate.\n\n\u201cMississippi is a red state, but I think most people would be surprised to learn that [John] McCain only won the state by 13 points, and [Mitt] Romney by 12. It is actually substantially less red than Alabama,\u201d Sean Trende, an elections analyst at RealClearPolitics, told me in an email. When you add it all up, Mississippi is a \u201clighter load than Alabama.\u201d\n\nThen you have the Trump factor. Right now, he is refusing to back Bryant\u2019s choice for the Cochran seat, which could set the stage for an insurgent upset on the GOP side.\n\nMississippi\u2019s senate race should be a familiar drama \u2014 the establishment versus the far-right wing, McConnell versus Bannon. GOP leaders are clearly maneuvering, based on all the available reporting, to appoint a viable replacement who will be able to hold off McDaniel and keep the seat safely red in November. \n\nThe race shaping up has some election watchers seeing Alabama again: An ultra-conservative prevails against the GOP establishment\u2019s preferred candidate and then falters in a race against a Democratic candidate with the right credentials to compete in the deep South.\n\nChris McDaniel versus the Republican establishment, explained\nFirst things first: The Mississippi race will be a jungle primary. That means every candidate runs in the first race on Election Day in November. If one candidate gets 50 percent of the total vote, they win. But if they don\u2019t \u2014 and it seems unlikely, with a strong Democratic candidate and a fractured GOP field \u2014 the top two candidates face each other in a runoff election that same month. (One of them could be the Democrat \u2014 who we\u2019ll get to in a bit.)\n\nMcDaniel is in. He was originally going to challenge Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), a favorite target of alt-right mastermind and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. McDaniel had discussed his Wicker challenge with Bannon before announcing, Mississippi Today reported last fall, and his potential candidacy had received favorable coverage on Breitbart, Bannon\u2019s former employer. But McDaniel switched over to the open Cochran race after the senator said that he would step down in April.\n\nIt probably doesn\u2019t make much difference to Bannon, who clearly sees Mississippi as fertile ground for the alt-right populist revolution he is still trying to get off the ground.\n\n\u201cMitch McConnell is a literal anchor tied to the hips of folks like Roger Wicker and Thad Cochran,\u201d Andy Surabian, a Bannon adviser, told NBC News last fall. \u201cWe expect the anti-establishment wave we are seeing across the country today to hit Mississippi like a tsunami in 2018 and beyond.\u201d\n\nBryant\u2019s pick to replace Cochran on April 1 instead is Cindy Hyde-Smith, the state\u2019s agriculture commissioner. She would be Mississippi\u2019s first woman senator.\n\nMcDaniel had once upon a time lobbied Bryant to name him as Cochran\u2019s replacement, the Washington Post reported, but the governor was not interested.\n\nThere is a lot of bad blood between McDaniel and the Republican establishment, leftover from the 2014 primary. Bryant even took a swing at McDaniel this week after the state senator announced that he would switch from the Wicker to the Cochran race.\n\n\u201cThis opportunistic behavior is a sad commentary for a young man who once had great potential,\u201d Bryant told the Jackson Clarion-Ledger. \n\nThe newspaper reported that Bryant was looking for a candidate who was particularly well suited to beating McDaniel. The governor seems to have settled on Hyde-Smith, but the White House and Washington Republicans aren\u2019t on board with his choice. Politico reported Wednesday that Trump won\u2019t campaign for or endorse Hyde-Smith because the White House is worried her history as a Democrat (she switched parties in 2010) could make her vulnerable.\n\nThe Post reported last month that McConnell had urged Bryant to appoint himself to the Senate. He would be the strongest possible candidate in the fall election, having won a number of statewide elections since the 1990s and currently possessing an approval rating above 50 percent.\n\nBryant passed up the Senate seat, but he clearly shares the establishment\u2019s interest in stopping McDaniel. Which brings us back to 2014.\n\nLet\u2019s remember how absolutely surreal the 2014 campaign was\nMcDaniel has to be taken seriously because he mounted a very credible challenge against Cochran in 2014. Let\u2019s start with the math: In the first round of the GOP\u2019s jungle primary that year, McDaniel actually got more votes (49.5 percent) than Cochran (49 percent) \u2014 a man named Thomas Carey got the remaining votes. But McDaniel did not get the needed 50 percent, so he and Cochran had a rematch.\n\nIn that showdown, Cochran narrowly prevailed over McDaniel, 51 percent to 49 percent, but not without a lot of bitterness and allegations of wrongdoing on both sides.\n\nBut those are the vote totals. That\u2019s not the memorable part. In brief \u2014 and to understand why Bryant and other establishment Republicans are so hellbent on beating McDaniel this year \u2014 here is your unofficial rundown of the 2014 Mississippi primary, courtesy of Talking Points Memo:\n\n\nA 26-year-old blogger and McDaniel supporter \u2014 nicknamed \u201cConstitutional Clayton\u201d \u2014 broke into the nursing home where Cochran\u2019s wife resides and took pictures of her for an attack ad accusing the senator of infidelity with one of his aides.\nThat blogger later went to jail for the break-in conspiracy. On a more tragic note, one of his alleged conspirators committed suicide during the investigation.\nChuck Johnson, the infamous conservative raconteur, accused the Cochran campaign of bribing black voters to support the senator.\nJohnson was later investigated by the Mississippi attorney general for his report and allegations that he actually bribed a source of the accusations he made against Cochran.\nBut after the election, the McDaniel campaign did file a lawsuit accusing the Cochran camp of soliciting Democratic votes, which they said would invalidate the results. The suit was eventually rejected by the state Supreme Court.\n\nIn other words, the McDaniel campaign tried to use the specter of black voters to delegitimize an election result \u2014 a problematic tactic, to say the least, given the state senator\u2019s history of racially charged remarks.\n\nThe 2014 race is still a sore point for everybody involved. Just this week, McDaniel said:\n\n\u201cWhat I have is a situation in which I\u2019m running for the same seat I ran for in 2014 \u2014 the seat we felt we won in 2014. Now God had other plans for that, obviously, and that\u2019s okay and we accept that. All I\u2019m asking for now is to be allowed to finish that term that we ran for in 2014.\u201d\n\nAnd that explains equally well, on the establishment side of the equation, why Bryant and other Republican leaders are so intent on defeating McDaniel again. McDaniel and his supporters had maligned Cochran, a titan of Mississippi Republican politics, and deployed dirtier-than-dirty tactics to try to unseat him.\n\nThe hypothetical path for another Democratic win in the Deep South\nAll of this leads to a pretty serious opening for Democrats. So who is the Democrat in this race? \n\nFormer Democratic Congress member Mike Espy \u2014 who comes with some of his own baggage after being acquitted of bribery charges in the 1990s \u2014 has already announced that he will run for Cochran\u2019s seat with the backing of Democrats in the state. The 64-year-old represented the Jackson area in Congress for six years before serving as President Bill Clinton\u2019s secretary of agriculture from 1993 to 1994. \n\nBut he was forced to step down amid an ethics investigation. Allegations were made that he improperly received airplane and sports tickets. Epsy was eventually acquitted on all charges, but it more or less ended his career in politics; he has been out of public office for nearly 25 years, spending the past decade as a private attorney.\n\nIf Espy proves to be a strong Democratic candidate, he will likely lock up one of the spots for the runoff election. That means the initial vote will function as a quasi-Republican primary: The top two GOP candidates will be vying to come in first or second and earn the right to face Epsy. And with Democratic turnout up all around the country, that could put Espy on the map in a real way. \n\n\u201cI think against a more traditional Southern Republican, you get maybe something that looks like the presidential numbers, tightened a bit for turnout,\u201d Trende told me.\n\nIt\u2019s far too early to say who will prevail in the Republican civil war: We don\u2019t even know who Bryant will appoint to Cochran\u2019s seat. If the establishment candidate wins, do not expect much of a race. Maybe things will be a little closer than usual.\n\nBut if McDaniel wins and faces Epsy in a one-on-one runoff, things start to get interesting.\n\nEpsy certainly starts with some challenges: He could have lost his skills in retail politics, he might not be adept at fundraising, etc. But if he shows up in game shape, he could have some real advantages in Mississippi against McDaniel.\n\nThe conservative candidate has a troubling list of, shall we say, racially charged rhetoric and affiliating with more openly racist people:\n\n\nHe spoke at a neo-Confederate conference in 2013.\nHe recently appeared on a radio show with a host who traffics in anti-Semitic 9/11 conspiracies.\nHe has blamed \u201chip-hop\u201d for gun violence, saying that it is \u201cmorally bankrupt\u201d and destroyed community values,\nTPM had a long rundown in 2014 of McDaniel\u2019s various remarks about reparations and \u201cmamacitas.\u201d\n\nWith some solid fundraising and spending, Epsy can turn out more black voters \u2014 already about one-third of the state\u2019s electorate \u2014 and he could then bring the race down to single digits, Trende told me.\n\n\u201cAt that point, you\u2019re really not talking about convincing that many whites to either state home or vote Democrat because of McDaniel\u2019s racialized statements,\u201d he said.\n\nEpsy, it should be noted, said kind words about Cochran as he announced his candidacy and the Clarion-Ledger wrote that Epsy has long been considered the model for the kind of black candidate who could win crossover white voters in Mississippi.\n\nWe\u2019re a long way from an Alabama-style upset coming to fruition in its neighbor state.

And last year, at least eight North Korean ships carrying fuel sailed from Russia to North Korea despite officially declaring that they were headed to other destinations. \n\nWhile there isn\u2019t definitive evidence that those ships violated international law, experts say the activity bore classic signs of sanction evasion tactics. In other words, Russia seems to be doing the literal opposite of what Trump wants.\n\nSyria, ISIS, and Iran\nAs mentioned above, Russia fuels the Syrian conflict, but Russia\u2019s meddling there takes many forms \u2014 and each one offers a different reason to doubt Moscow has any interest in working with Trump there.\n\nRussia, to take one example, is impeding any serious effort at finding a diplomatic solution to the fighting. In late February, it took three days for the United Nations to approve a resolution for a month-long ceasefire in Eastern Ghouta due to Russian objections. Moscow\u2019s representative initially vetoed the resolution on February 22, saying that reports of widespread civilian casualties were nothing more than \u201cmass psychosis.\u201d Instead, Russia proposed amendments that would allow it and Syrian forces to continue targeting anti-Assad groups. \n\nMore than 1,000 civilians have died in the Assad regime\u2019s accelerated air and ground campaign in Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of the capital Damascus, over the past month.\n\nAs for ISIS, Russia says it is in Syria to kill terrorists \u2014 which is also Trump\u2019s stated Syria policy \u2014 but has instead targeted anti-Assad rebels and indiscriminately bombed civilian areas. Last month, Russian mercenaries fought against US forces in Syria. No Americans died or received injuries, but about 200 Russians perished in the firefight.\n\nFinally, Russia is a major Iranian ally, and fights alongside Tehran in Syria. Iran provides fights and weaponry to its proxies and other militia groups, like Hezbollah, that help keep Assad in power. Russia has not condemned Iran\u2019s weapons influx into Syria.\n\nAnd here\u2019s one example: With Russian and Iranian help, Assad retook control of the major city of Aleppo in December 2016 after months of brutal fighting. That proved a turning point in the war and allowed Assad to regain control of the country.\n\nSo if Trump wants Putin to help in Syria, he\u2019ll have to convince Putin to do the opposite of everything he\u2019s tried to accomplish over the past few years.\n\nUkraine\nTrump\u2019s reference to the ongoing war there is particularly bizarre. Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014 and seized parts of Crimea, a southern peninsula, and eastern parts of the country. A low-level war has raged there ever since.\n\nBut to be extra clear: There would be no conflict in Ukraine if Russia had not invaded it. And as my colleague Zack Beauchamp reported, there are no signs the war will end any time soon.\n\nHere\u2019s why: A close Putin friend, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has a relationship with a mercenary group called Wagner. Wagner has reportedly played a major part in Russia\u2019s incursion, recruiting gunmen to fight on Russia\u2019s behalf without appearing in its uniform. Last summer, the US Treasury officially sanctioned Wagner and its director, Dmitry Utkin, for threatening \u201cthe peace, security, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nSo expect more Russian involvement in fueling Ukraine\u2019s war, not less.\n\n\u201cComing Arms Race\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear what Trump really meant by this, but here\u2019s a possibility: On March 1, Putin bragged during a major speech that his country now possed a nuclear-powered cruise missile that can reach the United States, nuclear weapons that can evade any missile defense system, and unstoppable drone submarines that could blow up foreign ports.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence Russia has any of these capabilities yet, but it made some experts nervous that Russia had more advanced weaponry than America. But Putin\u2019s boast was perhaps partially in response to the new Nuclear Posture Review the Pentagon released in February. The report details America\u2019s desire to develop newer and smaller nuclear bombs, in part to make them more usable.\n\nIn effect, Trump may be fueling an arms race with Moscow \u2014 even though he\u2019s asking for Russia\u2019s help to end the escalation.\n\nTrump clearly still thinks he can turn Putin from a foe to a friend. Putin seems likelier to take Trump\u2019s naivet\u00e9 and refusal to call his bluff as a green light to cause even more of the problems Trump keeps asking him to solve.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "German Lopez", "body": "It\u2019s going to happen again. There will be another mass shooting in America.\n\nIt\u2019s tragic to even write those words, but this is the clear pattern I\u2019ve seen since I began covering mass shootings for Vox in 2014: A horrific tragedy happens. There are calls for action. Maybe something gets introduced in Congress. The debate goes back and forth for a bit. Then people move on \u2014 usually after less than a week or two. And so there\u2019s eventually another shooting.\n\nAs a reporter, I have become eerily attuned to this horrible American ritual. I do the same thing every single time we get news of a mass shooting: verify reports, write a \u201cwhat we know\u201d article, and then begin to update our old pieces on guns. I do this almost instinctively at this point \u2014 and that terrifies me. No one should get used to this.\n\nThere are signs that the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, which killed at least 17 people and injured at least 14 others, could have a different outcome. There are protests already planned: the National School Walkout, the March for Our Lives, and more to come. Students with highly sympathetic stories are speaking up. The sense of outrage seems to be sustained in the week after the shooting.\n\n\u201cPoliticians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have ever been done to prevent this, we call BS,\u201d Emma Gonzales, a student survivor, said in a speech at a gun control rally that went viral. \u201cThey say that tougher gun laws do not decrease gun violence. We call BS. They say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun. We call BS. They say guns are just tools like knives and are as dangerous as cars. We call BS. \u2026 They say that no laws could have been able to prevent the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred. We call BS.\u201d\n\nBut I remain skeptical. The federal government did nothing after 6- and 7-year-olds were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 20 children, six adults, and himself in 2012. Since then, there have been more than 1,600 mass shootings, killing more than 1,800 people and wounding more than 6,400. Many of these events led to protests and calls for actions, but Congress refused to budge every time.\n\nAs I see it, the core issue is that America as a whole refuses to even admit it has a serious problem with guns and gun violence. And more than that, lawmakers continue acting like the solutions are some sort of mystery, as if there aren\u2019t years of research and experiences in other countries that show restrictions on firearms can save lives.\n\nConsider President Donald Trump\u2019s speech responding to the Florida shooting: His only mention of guns was a vague reference to \u201cgunfire\u201d as he described what happened. He never even brought up gun control or anything related to that debate, instead vaguely promising to work \u201cwith state and local leaders to help secure our schools and tackle the difficult issue of mental health.\u201d\n\nThis is America\u2019s elected leader \u2014 and he essentially, based on his public response, ignored what the real problem is. And although the White House has in recent days come around to bipartisan proposals to very slightly improve background checks and ban bump stocks, the compromises amount to fairly small changes to America\u2019s weak gun laws.\n\nIn my coverage of these shootings, I\u2019ve always focused on solutions through studies and policy ideas that would tamp down on the number of shootings. The good news is there are real solutions out there.\n\nBut America can\u2019t get to those solutions until it admits it has a gun problem and confronts the reality of what it would mean to seriously address it.\n\n1) America has a unique gun violence problem\nThe US is unique in two key \u2014 and related \u2014 ways when it comes to guns: It has way more gun deaths than other developed nations, and it has far more guns than any other country in the world.\n\nThe US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada, more than seven times that of Sweden, and nearly 16 times that of Germany, according to United Nations data compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.)\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Javier Zarracina/Vox\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nMass shootings actually make up a small fraction of America\u2019s gun deaths, constituting less than 2 percent of such deaths in 2013. But America does see a lot of these horrific events: According to CNN, \u201cThe US makes up less than 5% of the world\u2019s population, but holds 31% of global mass shooters.\u201d\n\nThe US also has by far the highest number of privately owned guns in the world. Estimated in 2007, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 88.8 guns per 100 people, meaning there was almost one privately owned gun per American and more than one per American adult. The world\u2019s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 54.8 guns per 100 people.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Max Fisher/Washington Post\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nAnother way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world\u2019s population yet own roughly 42 percent of all the world\u2019s privately held firearms.\n\nThese two facts \u2014 on gun deaths and firearm ownership \u2014 are related. The research, compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health\u2019s Injury Control Research Center, is pretty clear: After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths.\n\n\u201cWithin the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide,\u201d David Hemenway, the Injury Control Research Center\u2019s director, wrote in Private Guns, Public Health.\n\nThis chart, from researcher Josh Tewksbury, shows the correlation between the number of guns and gun deaths among wealthier nations:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Josh Tewksbury\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nGuns are not the only contributor to violence. (Other factors include, for example, poverty, urbanization, and alcohol consumption.) But when researchers control for other confounding variables, they have found time and time again that America\u2019s high levels of gun ownership are a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers. \n\n2) The problem is guns, not mental illness\nSupporters of gun rights look at America\u2019s high levels of gun violence and argue that guns are not the problem. They point to other issues, from violence in video games and movies to the breakdown of the traditional family.\n\nMost recently, they\u2019ve focused particularly on mental health. This is the only policy issue that Trump mentioned in his speech following the Florida shooting.\n\nBut as Dylan Matthews explained for Vox, people with mental illnesses are more likely to be victims, not perpetrators, of violence. And Michael Stone, a psychiatrist at Columbia University who maintains a database of mass shooters, wrote in a 2015 analysis that only 52 out of the 235 killers in the database, or about 22 percent, had mental illnesses. \u201cThe mentally ill should not bear the burden of being regarded as the \u2018chief\u2019 perpetrators of mass murder,\u201d he concluded. Other research has backed this up.\n\nThe problem, instead, is guns \u2014 and America\u2019s abundance of them.\n\nAs a breakthrough analysis by UC Berkeley\u2019s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins in 1999 found, it\u2019s not even that the US has more crime than other developed countries. This chart, from Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University, shows that the US is not an outlier when it comes to overall crime:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Jeffrey Swanson and ICVS\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nInstead, the US appears to have more lethal violence \u2014 and that\u2019s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns.\n\n\u201dA series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,\u201d Zimring and Hawkins wrote. \u201cA preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Jeffrey Swanson and OECD\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThis is in many ways intuitive: People of every country get into arguments and fights with friends, family, and peers. But in the US, it\u2019s much more likely that someone will get angry at an argument and be able to pull out a gun and kill someone.\n\n3) The research shows that gun control works\nThe research also suggests that gun control can work. A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence \u2014 a strong indicator that restricting access to firearms can save lives.\n\nConsider Australia\u2019s example.\n\nIn 1996, a 28-year-old man walked into a cafe in Port Arthur, Australia, ate lunch, pulled a semiautomatic rifle out of his bag, and opened fire on the crowd, killing 35 people and wounding 23 more. It was the worst mass shooting in Australia\u2019s history.\n\nAustralian lawmakers responded with legislation that, among other provisions, banned certain types of firearms, such as automatic and semiautomatic rifles and shotguns. The Australian government confiscated 650,000 of these guns through a gun buyback program, in which it purchased firearms from gun owners. It established a registry of all guns owned in the country and required a permit for all new firearm purchases. (This is much further than bills typically proposed in the US, which almost never make a serious attempt to immediately reduce the number of guns in the country.)\n\nAustralia\u2019s firearm homicide rate dropped by about 42 percent in the seven years after the law passed, and its firearm suicide rate fell by 57 percent, according to a review of the evidence by Harvard researchers.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to know for sure how much of the drop in homicides and suicides was caused specifically by the gun buyback program. Australia\u2019s gun deaths, for one, were already declining before the law passed. But researchers David Hemenway and Mary Vriniotis argue that the gun buyback program very likely played a role: \u201cFirst, the drop in firearm deaths was largest among the type of firearms most affected by the buyback. Second, firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates per capita fell proportionately more than in states with lower buyback rates.\u201d\n\nOne study of the program, by Australian researchers, found that buying back 3,500 guns per 100,000 people correlated with up to a 50 percent drop in firearm homicides and a 74 percent drop in gun suicides. As Matthews explained, the drop in homicides wasn\u2019t statistically significant because Australia already had a pretty low number of murders. But the drop in suicides most definitely was \u2014 and the results are striking.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Javier Zarracina/Vox\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nOne other fact, noted by Hemenway and Vriniotis in 2011: \u201cWhile 13 gun massacres (the killing of 4 or more people at one time) occurred in Australia in the 18 years before the [Australia gun control law], resulting in more than one hundred deaths, in the 14 following years (and up to the present), there were no gun massacres.\u201d\n\n4) State and local actions are not enough\nA common counterpoint to the evidence on gun control: If it works so well, why does Chicago have so much gun violence despite having some of the strictest gun policies in the US?\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made this argument after the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting: \u201cI think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country. That certainly hasn\u2019t helped there.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Chicago has fairly strict gun laws (although not the strictest). And it\u2019s true that the city has fairly high levels of gun violence (although also not the worst in the US).\n\nThis doesn\u2019t, however, expose the failure of gun control altogether, but rather the limit of leaving gun policies to a patchwork of local and state laws. The basic problem: If a city or state passes strict gun control measures, people can simply cross a border to buy guns in a jurisdiction with laxer laws.\n\nChicago, for example, requires a Firearm Owners Identification card, a background check, a three-day waiting period, and documentation for all firearm sales. But Indiana, across the border, doesn\u2019t require any of this for purchases between two private individuals (including those at gun shows and those who meet through the internet), allowing even someone with a criminal record to buy a firearm without passing a background check or submitting paperwork recording the sale.\n\nSo someone from Chicago can drive across the border \u2014 to Indiana or to other places with lax gun laws \u2014 and buy a gun without any of the big legal hurdles he would face at home. Then that person can resell or give guns to others in Chicago or keep them, leaving no paper trail behind. (This is illegal trafficking under federal law, but Indiana\u2019s lax laws and enforcement \u2014 particularly the lack of a paper trail \u2014 make it virtually impossible to catch someone until a gun is used in a crime.)\n\nThe result: According to a 2014 report from the Chicago Police Department, nearly 60 percent of the guns in crime scenes that were recovered and traced between 2009 and 2013 came from outside the state. About 19 percent came from Indiana \u2014 making it the most common state of origin for guns besides Illinois.\n\nThis isn\u2019t exclusive to Chicago. A 2016 report from the New York State Office of the Attorney General found that 74 percent of guns used in crimes in New York between 2010 and 2015 came from states with lax gun laws. (The gun trafficking chain from Southern states with weak gun laws to New York is so well-known it even has a name: \u201cthe Iron Pipeline.\u201d) And another 2016 report from the US Government Accountability Office found that most of the guns \u2014 as much as 70 percent \u2014 used in crimes in Mexico, which has strict gun laws, can be traced back to the US, which has generally weaker gun laws.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the stricter gun laws in Chicago, New York, or any other jurisdiction have no effect, but it does limit how far these local and state measures can go, since the root of the problem lies in other places\u2019 laws. The only way the pipeline could be stopped would be if all states individually strengthened their gun laws at once \u2014 or, more realistically, if the federal government passed a law that enforces stricter rules across the US.\n\n5) America probably needs to go further than anyone wants to admit\nAmerica\u2019s attention to gun control often focuses on a few specific measures: universal background checks, restrictions on people with mental illnesses buying firearms, and an assault weapons ban, for example. It is rare that American politicians, even on the left, go much further than that. Something like Australia\u2019s law \u2014 which amounts to a confiscation program \u2014 is never seriously considered.\n\nAs Dylan Matthews previously explained, this is a big issue. The US\u2019s gun problem is so dire that it arguably needs solutions that go way further than what we typically see in mainstream proposals \u2014 at least, if the US ever hopes to get down to European levels of gun violence.\n\nIf the fundamental problem is that America has far too many guns, then policies need to cut the number of guns in circulation right now to seriously reduce the number of gun deaths. Background checks and other restrictions on who can buy a gun can\u2019t achieve that in the short term. What America likely needs, then, is something more like Australia\u2019s mandatory buyback program \u2014 essentially, a gun confiscation scheme. \n\nBut no one in Congress is seriously proposing something that sweeping. The Manchin-Toomey bill, the only gun legislation in Congress after Sandy Hook that came close to becoming law, didn\u2019t even establish universal background checks. Recent proposals have been even milder, taking small steps like banning bump stocks or slightly improving the existing system for background checks.\n\nPart of the holdup is the Second Amendment. While there is reasonable scholarly debate about whether the Second Amendment actually protects all Americans\u2019 individual right to bear arms and prohibits stricter forms of gun control, the reality is the Supreme Court and US lawmakers widely agree that the Second Amendment does put barriers on how far restrictions can go. That would likely rule out anything like the Australian policy response short of a court reinterpretation or a repeal of the Second Amendment, neither of which seems likely.\n\nSo the US, for political, cultural, and legal reasons, seems to be unable to take the action that it really needs.\n\nNone of that is to say that milder measures are useless. Connecticut\u2019s law requiring gun purchasers to first obtain a license, for example, was followed by a 40 percent drop in gun homicides and a 15 percent reduction in suicides. Similar gains were seen in Missouri. It\u2019s difficult to separate these improvements from long-term trends (since gun homicides have generally been on the decline for decades now), but some of the decreases are likely linked to new restrictions on guns \u2014 and that means these measures truly saved lives.\n\nBut if America wants to get to the levels of gun deaths that its European peers report, it will likely need to go much further.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Emily Stewart", "body": "The White House is backing away from the gun control measures President Trump said he would back last month.\n\nThe administration unveiled Sunday its plan to combat school shootings following the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, in February that left 17 people dead. In the plan: a proposal to arm teachers. Not in it: a proposal to raise the age limit on buying certain assault rifles from 18 to 21.\n\nTrump calls on states to pass \u201crisk protection orders\u201d that allow law enforcement to take guns away from individuals they see as a threat to themselves or others, and pushes for Congress to pass two pieces of legislation on background checks and violence prevention programs. \n\nThe president is renewing his support for arming teachers and other school employees as well.\n\nThe White House will also create a federal task force to be led by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that will examine possible solutions for improving safety in schools \u2014 but the commission has no deadline for its findings. \n\n\u201cFar too often, the focus has been only on the most contentious fights, the things that have divided people and sent them into their entrenched corners,\u201d DeVos said on Sunday. \u201cBut the plan that we\u2019re going to advance and talk about is a pragmatic plan to dramatically increase school safety and to take steps to do so right away.\u201d\n\nRemember that gun control meeting in February? Trump apparently doesn\u2019t.\nPresident Trump in a meeting with lawmakers less than two weeks ago expressed openness to a lot of gun control measures that had Democrats cheering \u2014 while rightly skeptical of his declarations. \n\nHe expressed openness to raising the age for buying certain assault rifles to 21, supported a background check proposal from Sens. Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) that has twice failed in the Senate, and even seemed to express support for an assault weapons ban proposal from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). He said law enforcement should take firearms from individuals deemed dangerous and then go to court. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of the NRA,\u201d he told Toomey when he said his bill didn\u2019t address changing the gun purchase age limit.\n\nBut that Trump appears to have left the building. His administration\u2019s proposal is aiming at more low-hanging fruit:\n\n\nThe president will call on states to pass \u201crisk protection orders,\u201d temporary, court-issued orders that allow law enforcement to remove firearms from individuals who are a threat to themselves or others. They also prevent such individuals from buying new guns. \nThe president will urge Congress to pass the Fix NICS Act, a bipartisan bill sponsored by Sens. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Chris Murphy (D-CT). The legislation seeks to strengthen background checks by punishing federal agencies that don\u2019t submit criminal records to the national criminal background check system for firearms and by giving states financial incentives to report. \nTrump is also backing the STOP School Violence Act, which doesn\u2019t address guns but provides an annual grant to schools for \u201cevidence-based\u201d training programs and revamped reporting systems. \nThe administration will work with states to provide \u201crigorous firearms training to specially qualified volunteer school personnel.\u201d It will use existing Justice Department funding.\nThe White House will focus on increasing the \u201cintegration\u201d of mental health primary care and family services and support programs that use court-ordered treatment.\nThe administration will conduct a full audit and review of the FBI tip line. \n\nThe Justice Department on Saturday also formally submitted a rule to ban bump stocks, devices that can turn high-capacity rifles into automatic weapons. The rule would take months to implement if implemented at all, as there is debate as to whether the president can act on that front without Congress. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot Trump isn\u2019t doing\nTrump isn\u2019t endorsing the Toomey-Manchin proposal that would extend background checks on gun purchases made online. He certainly isn\u2019t calling for an assault weapons ban, and he\u2019s backed off of raising the age limit to 21. \n\nWhen asked by reporters on Sunday about Trump\u2019s change of tune, administration officials said the president wants Congress to \u201cact now,\u201d without obstruction. They said the age is a \u201cstate-based discussion going on right now\u201d and something the commission will look at. \n\nWhen asked about the president\u2019s February comments that his administration was going to \u201cwork on getting the age up to 21 and 18\u201d and said it \u201cdoesn\u2019t make sense\u201d that handguns can\u2019t be bought until 21 but assault weapons can, DeVos in an appearance on Today on Monday demurred. \u201cThe plan is really the first step in a more lengthy process, and the proposals that the president has put forward really encompass a lot of things that are supported on a broad bipartisan basis in Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is on the table.\u201d \n\nTrump in a string of tweets on Monday defended his administration\u2019s proposals. \n\n\n\nVery strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by White House. Legislation moving forward. Bump Stocks will soon be out. Highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry, subject to State Law. Armed guards OK, deterrent!.......\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n....On 18 to 21 Age Limits, watching court cases and rulings before acting. States are making this decision. Things are moving rapidly on this, but not much political support (to put it mildly).\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2018\n\n\n\n\nOf avoiding changing the gun purchase age limit, Trump said he is watching court cases and rulings before acting. The National Rifle Association on Friday sued to block part of a Florida gun law that would raise the age limit to buy firearms to 21 just hours after the legislation was signed. \n\nTrump said on Twitter on Monday that there was \u201cnot much political support (to put it mildly)\u201d for raising the age limit. A recent Politico/Morning Consult poll found that 82 percent of Americans support requiring a person to be 21 to purchase an assault-style weapon, and 81 percent support requiring a person to be 21 to buy a gun. A separate Survey Monkey poll found that three-quarters of Americans across all age groups support setting a minimum age of 21 to buy an AR-15 style rifle. \n\nIt\u2019s not clear whose \u201cpolitical support\u201d Trump believes is lacking on the age limit issue. Perhaps from the NRA \u2014 the president met with the group at the White House on March 1, the day after his White House meeting with lawmakers. \n\n\n\nGood (Great) meeting in the Oval Office tonight with the NRA!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 2, 2018\n\n\n\n\nGiving teachers guns is probably a bad idea\nAdministration officials on Sunday said that the Justice Department will provide assistance to states to help partner with state and local law enforcement to provide firearms training with school personnel. In other words, they\u2019re going to give guns to teachers and hope it helps.\n\nThe proposal propels the narrative that a good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy with a gun \u2014 and one that is probably wrong. As Vox\u2019s German Lopez recently pointed out, there is no good research on the effect of arming teachers or the effect of putting more armed police or security in schools. And based on the evidence we do have, there\u2019s enough to suggest that putting more guns in schools could actually make gun violence worse. The problem in the US is that there are so many guns in circulation, making it easier for conflict to escalate to gun violence. More guns are likely to make the problem better, not worse. \n\nToday\u2019s Savannah Guthrie on Monday asked DeVos for specifics on the idea to arm teachers, and she repeatedly hedged on giving definitive answers. She said she did not have a \u201cpercentage\u201d in mind for how many teachers would need to be armed to be effective  in boosting security but didn\u2019t believe teachers in every classroom or every grade should have guns.\n\n\u201cThe point is that schools should have this tool if they choose to use the tool,\u201d DeVos said. \u201cCommunities should have the tools, states should have the tool, but nobody should be mandated to do it.\u201d\n\nTrump on Monday took a more aggressive tack and on Twitter said that arming teachers and guards would serve as a \u201cdeterrent.\u201d He suggested that schools that are gun-free zones are an \u201copen invitation\u201d for shooters to enter.\n\n\n\nIf schools are mandated to be gun free zones, violence and danger are given an open invitation to enter. Almost all school shootings are in gun free zones. Cowards will only go where there is no deterrent!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2018\n\n\n\n\nDeVos\u2019s commission will gather various stakeholders to discuss potential solutions. It has no deadline for its findings.\nAs for the school safety commission, DeVos said on Sunday in a call with reporters that she would bring together a \u201cwide array\u201d of education practitioners \u201cto help identify best practices and solutions that are working in communities and states across our country.\u201d She said they would focus on identifying risks early on, starting with social and emotional wellbeing and increased access, consistency, and transparency in mental health services.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when the commission will act. Senior administration officials said the matter is \u201curgent,\u201d but there\u2019s no deadline that would \u201cprevent it from being a deliberative process.\u201d An official said the public would \u201ccertainly see responses in under a year\u201d for the commission\u2019s recommendation.\n\nPresident Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday mocked \u201cblue-ribbon committees\u201d that do nothing but \u201ctalk, talk, talk,\u201d specifically referring to committees on opioids and drugs. When asked about why Trump thinks such committees are a bad idea for drugs but a good one for school safety, a senior administration official responded, \u201cWhy focus on a commission for this issue?\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Dylan Scott", "body": "He took shots at Congress, at Democrats, at the Senate\u2019s procedurals and promised that he would not sign another mega-spending package that is released at the last minute. But, this time, he did sign it.\n\nTrump\u2019s full remarks are below.\n\n\nThank you very much, everybody. We have a lot of good news to report. Some tremendous trade deals are being made with various countries. We\u2019re negotiating very long, very hard but very quickly. \n\nThe deal with South Korea, according to secretary Ross and Bob lighthizer, is very close to being finished, and we\u2019re going to have a wonderful deal with a wonderful ally. We\u2019re getting very close to it. It was a deal that was causing a lot of problems for our country in terms of employment and is very close to being finished, and we\u2019re going to have a wonderful deal with a wonderful ally. We\u2019re getting very close to it. It was a deal that was causing a lot of problems for our country in terms of employment and in terms of lots of other INGs. I might ask Secretary Ross to just say a few words about that, and then we\u2019re going to get on to this ridiculous situation that took place over the last week. So, secretary Ross?\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross\n\nThank you, Mr. President. We believe are relatively close to a pretty comprehensive resolution with the south Korean government. \n\nIt would encompass, if I goes through, both the 232s and broader trade issues. We hope sometime next week to be able to have a real announcement. \n\nDonald Trump\n\nThank you very much, Wilbur. I appreciate it. The last time we negotiated something like this, and as you know, it\u2019s always been a problem for our country. They get together and they create a series of documents that nobody has been able to read because it was just done. You tell me who can read that quickly. It takes a long time to read it. For the last eight years, deep defense cuts have undermined our national security. If you look at what\u2019s taken out, they hallowed our readiness as a military unit and put America at really grave risk. \n\nMy highest duty is to keep America safe. Nothing more important. \n\nThe omnibus bill reverses this dangerous defense as crazy as it\u2019s been, as difficult as it\u2019s been, as much opposition to the military as we\u2019ve had from the Democrats, and it has been tremendous. \n\nI tried to explain to them, the military is for Republicans and Democrats and for everybody else. But we have tremendous opposition to creating, really, what will be by far the strongest military that we\u2019ve ever had. \n\nWe\u2019ve had that from the Democrats. So if we take something for the military, they want something for, in many cases, things that are really a wasted sum of money. It\u2019s not right and it\u2019s very bad for our country. We\u2019re looking to do funding for our final fight in certain areas. As you know, we\u2019ve gotten just about 100% of our land back from ISIS. We have troop increases necessary to accomplish what we have to do, and we have, very importantly, a pay increase for our troops. \n\nAnd this will actually be the largest pay increase for our incredible people in over a decade. It increases total defense spending by more than $60 billion from last year and funds the addition ofritically needed ships, planes, helicopters, tanks and submarines. We have submarines being built the likes of which there is nothing anywhere in the world like the submarines we build. Our military equipment is the best equipment in the world. One of the things you saw two days ago with Saudi Arabia and with other countries, Saudi Arabia as an example is buying hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of our equipment. And we\u2019re getting very fast approvals on that. \n\nTherefore, as a matter of national security, I\u2019ve signed this omnibus budget bill. There are a lot of things I\u2019m unhappy about in this bill. There are a lot of things we shouldn\u2019t have had in this bill but we were, in a sense, forced if we want to build our military, we were forced to have. There are some things we should have in the bill. But I say to congress, I will never sign another bill like this again. I\u2019m not going to do it again. Nobody read it. It\u2019s only hours old. Some people don\u2019t even know -- it\u2019s $1.3 trillion. \n\nIt\u2019s the second largest ever. President Obama signed one that was actually larger, which I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t too happy with, either. But in this case it became so big because we need to take care of our military. And because the Democrats, who don\u2019t believe in that, added things that they wanted in order to get their votes. We have to get rid of the filibuster rule. We have to get rid of the filibuster rule and go to 51 votes in the senate if we\u2019re going to have really sustained, continued success. DACA recipients have been treated extremely badly by the Democrats. We wanted to include DACA. We wanted to have them in this bill. 800,000 people. \n\nAnd actually, it could even be more. And we wanted to include DACA in this bill. The Democrats would not do it. They would not do it. To prevent the omnibus situation from ever happening again, I\u2019m calling on congress to give me a line item veto for a government spending bills, and the senate must end. \n\nThey must end the filibuster rule and get down to work. Have to get a lot of great legislation approved, and without the filibuster rule, it will happen just like magic. I want to address the situation on border security, which I call national defense. I call it stopping drugs from pouring across our border. And I call it illegal immigration. It\u2019s all of those things. But national defense is a very important two words, because by having a strong border system, including a wall, we are in a position militarily that is very advantageous. And before I get off of that subject, I would like to ask secretary Mattis to talk about what we\u2019ve accomplished in terms of the military, because there has never been anything like we\u2019ve been able to do. Our military is very depleted but it\u2019s rapidly getting better, and in a short period of time it will be stronger than it\u2019s ever been. I would like Secretary Mattis to say a few words, please. \n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis:\n\nThank you, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. In 1790 in George Washington\u2019s first annual address to congress, he stated to be prepared for war is one of the most effective means of preserving the peace. As the President noted, today we received the largest military budget in history reversing many years of decline and unpredictable funding. And together we are going to make our military stronger than ever. We in the military are humbled and grateful to the American people for their sacrifices on behalf of this funding. \n\nNow it\u2019s our responsibility in the military to spend every dollar wisely in order to keep the trust and the confidence of the American people and the congress. Thank you.\n\nDonald Trump:\n\nThank you very much, general. The border we\u2019ve worked very hard on. We have a lot of, really by any standard a lot, but not by this standard, but we\u2019re going to make it go a long way. There\u2019s a lot of money coming to the border and it will be coming in a period of time. We funded the initial down payment of $106,000, but we\u2019ll be start work literally on Monday on not only some new wall -- not enough but we\u2019re working on that very quickly -- but also fixing existing walls and fixing acceptable fences. You have to be able to see through the other side to see what\u2019s coming. In many cases it\u2019s not a ptty picture when you look. \n\nBut you have to be able to see it. So we have $1.6 billion for the wall. That will start immediately. But you have to be able to see it. So we have $1.6 billion for the wall. That will start immediately. This is a short-term funding but it\u2019s immediate, starts immediately, and I\u2019d like to ask Secretary Nielsen to say a few words about what we\u2019ve done in terms of homeland security and what the bill does for homeland security. Thank you. \n\nHomeland Security Secretary Nielsen\n\nGood afternoon. We at the department of homeland security work very closely with the department of defense and we support this omnibus in the defense of our country. As the president has stated, under his leadership he has delivered for the Americans. This is for American enforcement. This will help us with our aviation security with some badly needed upgrades, and we look forward to working with congress on some additional needs that we have. \n\nI will say, however, it\u2019s unfortunate that congress chose not to listen to the security on the front lines. We will continue to make sure the wall is where we need it, how we need it as the president described and to make sure it serves the American people and the security of this nation. We will also work with congress to close the dangerous loopholes that the president has mentioned many times and to continue to increase our overall security. And finally, we thank those in congress who support the department of homeland security. I will continue to make myself available to them. I look forward to working with them, but we must fund the department and give it the tools and resources it needs to execute the mission the American people have asked us to do. Thank you. \n\nDonald Trump\n\nThank you very much, Secretary. So we have many elements in the bill that we wanted. Just to look at a few of them, we\u2019re providing $654.6 billion in total discretionary funding for defense. It\u2019s a record. All records for defense. There will be nobody that says that our military is going to be depleted like they\u2019ve been saying over the last long period of time. Long period of time. Frankly, beyond president Obama. That won\u2019t be happening. We\u2019re spending a lot of money on nuclear, our nuclear systems, to upgrade, and in some cases, brand new, whether it\u2019s submarines, nuclear submarines and others. So we\u2019ll have by far the most powerful nuclear force on Earth, and it will be absolutely in perfect shape and condition, and hopefully, praise be to god we don\u2019t ever have to use it. But there will be nobody that\u2019s even close. \n\nThis will give a substantial increase to people even outside of the military, but military related. Some of the many things that we\u2019re buying in the military, we have $23.8 billion to procure 34 Navy ships. Our Navy is at about the lowest point in terms of ships that it\u2019s been in over 100 years. And we\u2019re adding a significant number of extremely advanced vessels. $10.2 billion for 90 f-35 aircraft. That\u2019s the most sophisticated aircraft in the world, jet fighters. They\u2019re hard to find, they\u2019re hard to see, therefore they\u2019re hard to beat. It\u2019s very tough to beat a plane when you can\u2019t see it. This is the most advanced in the world. 10.2 billion for 90 f-35. We have 2.9 billion for 15 kc-46 tanker aircraft. \n\nThe tanker aircraft is very important based on everything. It allows our planes to travel anywhere in the world without landing. 1.8 billion for 24 fa-18F super hornet aircraft fighter jets. 1.7 billion for 10 pa -- the poseidons. Incredible stuff. 1 billion for the black hawk helicopter, fighting machine. 1.1 billion for the upgrade of 85 Abrams tanks. \n\n75 million for the cooperative programs that we\u2019re working with Israel and others on various missile defense systems. We\u2019re spending a lot of money on missile defense. We have a lot of defense that\u2019s been recently installed. \n\nWe\u2019re spending tremendous money on missile defense. You understand what that means? Everybody does. With what we have out there, missile defense is very very important. We are funding our border patrol agents and our I.C.E. Agents. They are working long hours under tremendously dangerous conditions. \n\nWe\u2019re adding large numbers of immigration judges, high quality judges. Not only are we adding them in the district court level and the federal level of court of appeals, but we\u2019re adding immigration judges at a very high level.\n\nSo while we\u2019re very disappointed in the 1.3 trillion, there\u2019s nobody more disappointed than me because the number is so large, we\u2019ll start coming down. We had no choice but to fund our military because we have to have by far the strongest military in the world. And this will be by far the strongest military that we\u2019ve ever had. So when you look all of these pages, a lot of that is devoted -- a lot -- to the military. \n\nI just want to thank members of congress for working so hard. While we can be disappointed in some ways, we have to also know that there are a lot of strings pulling everybody in different directions. \n\nThe Republican senators, the Republican congressmen and women have been steadfast in their fight for the border and steadfast for their fight on the military. We\u2019re also spending $6 billion on, as you know, various forms of drug control, helping people that are addicted. It\u2019s terrible problem, but this will be also -- this will be a record. We\u2019ll be suing certain drug companies for what they\u2019ve done with the opioids and we\u2019ll be bringing the suits at a federal level. The level of drugs that are being put out there and the power of this addiction is hard to believe. People go to the hospital for a period of a week and they come out and they\u2019re drug addicts. There has to be a better way. Doctors are way down now in their orders of the opioids, way down. It\u2019s a great thing. \n\nWe\u2019re also looking for, in our research funds, we\u2019re looking for a medicine that can stop the pain without the addiction so at people aren\u2019t going to become addicted to these incredible drugs. That\u2019s part of what we have. We\u2019re going to have $6 billion having to do with opioids and other problems that this country, and in fact the world, is having with drugs. So we\u2019re extremely proud of what we\u2019ve been able to do when it comes to our military. Our military will be far superior than to any military anywhere in the world. That\u2019s very import for us. You see the players out there, you see what we\u2019re dealing with. We are very happy with what\u2019s happened with opioids. We\u2019re very happy with what\u2019s happened with certain elements of the border. \n\nNot happy with $1.6 billion, but it does start the wall and we\u2019ll make that $1.6 billion go very far. I can say this, and I say this to DACA recipients. The Republicans are with you, they want to get your situation taken care of. The Democrats just fought every single inch of the way. They did not want DACA in this bill. And as you know, DACA is also tied to the wall for the major funding, the $25 billion for the wall and other things. So I think that will be coming up very soon. But I do want the hispanic community to know and DACA recipients to know that Republicans are much more on your side than the Democrats who are using you for their own purposes. \n\nWith that being said, I just want to thank everybody for being here. We\u2019re very proud of many of the items that we\u2019ve been able to get. We\u2019re very disappointed that in order to fund the military, we had to give up things where we consider, in many cases, them to be bad or them to be a waste of money. But that\u2019s the way, unfortunately, right now the system works. But we have a great country. We are going to have the greatest military we\u2019ve ever had, and lots of good things are happening. The trade situation we\u2019ll be talking about next week. \n\nHave many trade deals, not only a deal being made on south Korea which looks like it\u2019s very close to being finalized, but many other countries are now negotiating fair trade deals with us. So we\u2019ll be rolling them out as you see them. Part of the reason, frankly, that we\u2019re able to do that is the fact that we have the tariffs on steel and the tariffs on aluminum. Because it showed how unfair some of these trade deals that have been in existence for many years, how unfair they\u2019ve been. So it will be great for our country, and frankly, it will also be great for other countries. And it will be fair and it will be reciprocal. Thank you all very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Tara Golshan", "body": "Democrats want to make Texas blue \u2014 or at the very least, purple \u2014 and a massive surge in voter enthusiasm is giving them hope.\n\nEarly vote totals for Texas\u2019s midterm election primary\u2019s are looking good for Democrats, who are showing extremely high levels of enthusiasm. Democratic turnout has increased by 90 percent compared to the 2014 midterms and is even above the 2016 presidential election year levels. Republican early voter turnout is up by 17 percent from 2014, but still lagging behind 2016 turnout. \n\nWith a primary Election Day on Tuesday that will determine the Democratic and Republican frontrunners for all 36 congressional districts, a US Senate seat, and a governor\u2019s office, Democrats are hoping this early surge of energy among their base can carry through to November.\n\nThe energy is beginning to spook Republicans in the state. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is up for reelection, and his campaign told supporters the energy \u201cshould shock every conservative to their core.\u201d\n\nAt a GOP event, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) told supporters Democrats would \u201ccrawl over broken glass in November to vote,\u201d warning that Republicans \u201ccould get obliterated at the polls.\u201d \n\nTo be sure, early voting numbers don\u2019t dictate the outcome of elections (Hillary Clinton\u2019s early voting totals also looked pretty good going into Election Day), and November is still a long ways away. But in a state notorious for having some of the worst voter turnout in the country, this is a major sign that Democrats are motivated to get out to the polls.\n\nWhat we can \u2014 and cannot \u2014 take away from the early voting numbers\nEarly voting numbers aren\u2019t a good indicator of election outcomes, but they are a strong measure of voter enthusiasm; lots of early voters means lots of decided voters.\n\nAnd in Texas\u2019s biggest counties, Democrats are even surpassing their early voting numbers from the 2016 primaries, a presidential year. (Midterm election years usually see depressed voter turnout.) The state hasn\u2019t tracked early voting in smaller, more rural counties, where Republicans likely have a much larger advantage. \n\nEven so, the action is definitely putting Republicans on their toes. Democrats have already won several deeply red state special elections around the country and come close in several others. Their high fundraising numbers also can\u2019t be overlooked. Democratic favorite Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX), who\u2019s aiming to challenge Cruz in November, has already out-fundraised the Republican incumbent.\n\nMore participation in primary elections doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate with higher voter turnout in general elections. Republicans could \u2014 and have in the past \u2014 turned out in much higher numbers in the general election than in the primary. But there\u2019s no question that enthusiasm is high among Democrats. This means that in November they\u2019ll need to keep up their voter mobilization efforts in urban counties if they have any hope of winning over some Republican congressional seats.\n\nAs Vox\u2019s Ella Nilsen explained, Democrats are eyeing three districts in Texas for November \u2014 around Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio \u2014 all of which Hillary Clinton carried by a couple points in 2016 and have the potential to flip blue.\n\nDemocrats are banking on President Donald Trump\u2019s unpopularity to push people to the polls. And Republicans are taking the threat seriously. Trump\u2019s favorability in Texas isn\u2019t as high as a state with a deeply red reputation would suggest. In February, 78 percent of Democrats found Trump to be very unfavorable and only 53 percent of Republicans found Trump to be \u201cvery favorable.\u201d\n\nTexas is known for having terrible voter turnout\nHistorically, Texas has consistently ranked among the lowest voter turnout in the country.\n\nThe depressed electoral participation has been attributed to a host of reasons in the past, from acts of voter suppression to unmotivated voters. In 2010, slightly more than a third of eligible Texas voters decided the governor\u2019s race. Fewer than 30 percent voted in the 2014 midterm cycle\u2019s general election.\n\nBut as Texas Tribune\u2019s Alexa Ura and Ryan Murphy point out, Texas\u2019s turnout is also tied deeply to demographics:\n\n\nHopes for a swell in voter turnout often hinge on the state\u2019s burgeoning Hispanic population. But a breakdown of the population by age shows a third of Texas Hispanics aren\u2019t even of voting age. In fact, those under 18 make up the state\u2019s largest Hispanic age group. Meanwhile, those aged 45 to 64 make up the biggest age group of white Texans.\n\nTo be clear, Hispanic adults participate in elections at lower rates than their white and black counterparts overall, which makes them an easy target for voter mobilization efforts. But when it comes to convincing Hispanic voters to play a bigger role in elections, it doesn\u2019t help that they\u2019re already starting from behind.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, Texas\u2019s older population is much more likely to participate in elections than the young population, with the largest turnout from voters 65 years old and up. So while Texas is a young state, older Texans make up most of the vote.\n\nDemocrats are hoping Trump\u2019s unique unpopularity \u2014 and his targeted attacks toward the Hispanic population \u2014 can be enough to change the tide. \n\nThe enthusiasm for the primaries is proving to be some encouragement.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Andrew Prokop", "body": "Stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one. A Russian oligarch, a top Russian government official, and a high-end escort take a trip together on a yacht. Months later, after being thrown into a Thai prison, the escort claims she knows about secret Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. And she says she has tapes.\n\nIt sounds utterly absurd. And, to be clear, Anastasia Vashukevich (who also goes by the name Nastya Rybka) may not actually have anything close to what she claims she does. She\u2019s clearly self-interested \u2014 she\u2019s trying to avoid deportation back to her home country of Belarus and is asking the US to extradite her in exchange for her information. She also has a history of bizarre self-promotional stunts.\n\nBut Vashukevich\u2019s claims have been getting a surprising amount of attention from mainstream media sources \u2014 and for some understandable reasons.\n\nFor one, that wasn\u2019t just any oligarch she traveled with. It was Russian aluminum magnate and former Paul Manafort employer Oleg Deripaska. That\u2019s the oligarch whom Manafort wanted to privately brief and with whom he seems to have surreptitiously communicated, through an intermediary, while he chaired Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nFor another, it wasn\u2019t just any top Russian government official who accompanied them on Deripaska\u2019s yacht \u2014 it was Sergei Prikhodko, Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister, a longtime Putin ally who has a foreign policy portfolio and is a very high-ranking official indeed.\n\nFinally, the idea that Vashukevich might have secretly taped their conversations isn\u2019t just hypothetical. At least once, she clearly did it, recording the two men as Deripaska discussed US-Russia relations. She later posted the video on her public Instagram account, where it sat for many months, essentially unnoticed, until anti-corruption political activist and Putin critic Alexei Navalny discovered it and explained its import in a YouTube video, accusing the deputy prime minister of accepting bribes from the oligarch.\n\nNow, whether Vashukevich actually has 16 more hours of such recordings, as she says, and whether they are as damning as she claims, are different questions \u2014 ones we can\u2019t answer yet. But this saga has already had major ramifications \u2014 it\u2019s spurred the Russian government to block Navalny\u2019s website just weeks before Russia\u2019s presidential election, and to threaten to block YouTube and Instagram entirely in Russia as well.\n\nFurthermore, all this revives yet again the many unanswered questions of just what Manafort was really up to during the Trump campaign. Emails between Manafort and a business associate make clear that Manafort, who was badly indebted to Deripaska, wanted to use his newfound prominence to \u201cget whole.\u201d The emails also appear to reference Manafort\u2019s associate having a lengthy meeting with Deripaska and bringing back important messages. They also reference \u201ccaviar\u201d \u2014 an apparent code for money \u2014 in relation to him. And all this unfolded just days before this very voyage.\n\nVashukevich\u2019s Instagram corroborates her yacht trip\n\nBack in early August 2016, at the height of the US presidential campaign, the oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, and the deputy Russian prime minister, Sergei Prikhodko, took a multi-day yacht trip together off the coast of Norway. They invited several high-end escorts along for the trip, including Anastasia Vashukevich of Belarus, who was about 19 years old at the time.\n\nVashukevich, a frequent social media user, Instagrammed her trip, posting photos and video, apparently unbeknownst to the two men. In one video snippet she posted as part of a montage several months later, the men talk United States relations, and Deripaska says the following (according to a translation provided in Navalny\u2019s video):\n\nWe\u2019ve got bad relations with America, because the friend of Sergey Eduardovich [Prikhodko], Nuland\u2019s her name, is responsible for them. When she was your age, she\u2019s spent a month on a Russian whaling boat. She hates our country after this. Why is that?\n\nThe \u201cshe\u201d is in reference to Victoria Nuland, who was President Obama\u2019s top State Department official overseeing Russian relations and was loathed by many in the Russian government (a diplomatically embarrassing private conversation she had was once taped and leaked). In and of itself, Deripaska\u2019s remark here is hardly a bombshell \u2014 but it does tell us that Deripaska was willing to talk about such topics in front of Vashukevich.\n\nVashukevich\u2019s public Instagram posts of the yacht trip remained unnoticed for more than a year. (Here\u2019s her feed, which is NSFW.) In that time, she wrote a book called Who Wants to Seduce a Billionaire describing what she says was her affair with an oligarch, including a  detailed description of a yacht trip with him and a top politician (though she didn\u2019t name either man). Eventually, she went public in the Russian media about her affair with Deripaska.\n\nAll this seemed like a salacious but inconsequential story \u2014 until Vashukevich got the attention of Alexei Navalny.\n\nA leading Putin critic unraveled this tangled tale in a YouTube video\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Alexei Navalny awaits release in 2014.\n      \n      \n        Dmitry Serebryakov/AFP/Getty\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nAlexei Navalny, a lawyer, media commentator, and activist, is one of Russia\u2019s most high-profile critics of Vladimir Putin. He\u2019s organized demonstrations, exposed apparent corruption, and faced charges from the government, and he tried to challenge Putin for president in 2018 before his campaign was blocked by electoral authorities.\n\nOne day in September 2017, Vashukevich and a group of other scantily dressed women came by Navalny\u2019s campaign headquarters, at the same time as a camera crew, in an apparent attempt to cause an embarrassing scene for him. \n\nCurious who this group was and what they were up to, Navalny and his team researched them \u2014 and eventually disclosed their findings in a highly entertaining 25-minute YouTube video (it\u2019s in Russian but has English subtitles, and my quotes are from those subtitles). \u201cThey are some mildly insane activists who, either for money or for the show, take part in some highly unusual events,\u201d Navalny said. \n\nFor instance, just weeks after their activity at Navalny\u2019s office, Vashukevich and four other women stood nearly naked outside the US Embassy in what they claimed was a demonstration in support of Harvey Weinstein. One had \u201cLove you Harvey\u201d written on her body, another \u201cFuck me Harvey.\u201d (Naturally, Vashukevich Instagrammed it.) \n\nIn another video, Vashukevich said, \u201cI want to address Alexei Navalny. Alex, one of us will find you and fuck you and post the video of it on the internet. Because of you and those like you, people keep fighting wars now.\u201d Then in February, Vashukevich traveled to Thailand, where she began participating in a \u201csex seminar.\u201d\n\nAfter combing social media posts and reviewing Vashukevich\u2019s book, Navalny\u2019s team unraveled basically all of the truly bizarre tale laid out above \u2014 and realized just who was with Vashukevich on that Instagrammed yacht trip. Navalny\u2019s interest was in documenting and denouncing what he alleged was the blatant corruption and bribery of Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister. \n\nHis video caused an earthquake. Deripaska sued in a Russian court to try to get YouTube to take down Navalny\u2019s video, and to get either Instagram or Vashukevich to take down her posts of him. And a Russian government watchdog agency threatened to block all of YouTube and Instagram in Russia over the matter. Eventually, Vashukevich deleted some of her Instagram posts and Instagram agreed to take down the others. And while YouTube hasn\u2019t removed Navalny\u2019s video, the Russian government blocked Navalny\u2019s website in the country.\n\nBut then Vashukevich was arrested \u2014 and she claims to have more recordings proving Russian meddling in the US election\n\nThat\u2019s where things stood \u2014 until February 25, when Vashukevich and several others participating in her \u201csex seminar\u201d were arrested in Thailand for apparently completely unrelated reasons. (The New York Times reports that \u201cseveral attendees said that no sex had been involved\u201d in the seminar, and that it was instead about \u201cimproving communication and on perfecting the art of seduction.\u201d) \n\nVashukevich, who has posted Instagram videos and photos documenting her prison experience, is potentially facing deportation because she lacks a work permit. So she has gone public, alleging that she has secret knowledge of Russian interference in the US presidential election \u2014 and that she fears she wouldn\u2019t be safe if deported back to Russia or Belarus. An associate of hers who was also arrested wrote a letter to the United States seeking political asylum for the group, saying, \u201cWe have important information for USA and we risk our lives very much.\u201d\n\nThe Times\u2019s Richard Paddock then interviewed the detained Vashukevich this week, and she claimed she had more than 16 hours of audio recordings from her trip with Deripaska and Prikhodko. \u201cIf America gives me protection, I will tell everything I know,\u201d she said. \u201cI am afraid to go back to Russia. Some strange things can happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were discussing elections,\u201d she went on. \u201cDeripaska had a plan about elections.\u201d And she claimed they had conversations with three people who spoke English fluently and who she thought were Americans. (Again, we don\u2019t know whether this is true or self-serving.)\n\nThe reason Vashukevich\u2019s claims could matter: Paul Manafort and Oleg Deripaska seem to have been in contact right before her trip\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Drew Angerer/Getty\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nLeaving aside Vashukevich\u2019s claims, which are currently very far from proven, there are still many questions about Paul Manafort and whether he tried to make contact with Oleg Deripaska while he was also chairing Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. (Manafort has since been indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team, but not in relation to this.)\n\nDeripaska was an old client of Manafort\u2019s \u2014 in fact, the connected oligarch was one of Manafort\u2019s first clients in what proved to be a very lucrative line of business in Russia and Eastern Europe. But things went awry between the two \u2014 they had a falling-out that ended in a lawsuit, with Deripaska claiming Manafort cheated him of millions.\n\nSo when the badly indebted Manafort got a high-profile job advising Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in March 2016, Manafort saw an opportunity. He emailed his business associate Konstantin Kilimnik in early April about his newly high media profile, writing, \u201cHow do we use to get whole,\u201d and \u201cHas OVD operation seen?\u201d (These are Deripaska\u2019s initials.)\n\nThen in July, Manafort and Kilimnik exchanged emails about Deripaska again, as the Washington Post and the Atlantic reported last year. \u201cI am carefully optimistic on the issue of our biggest interest,\u201d Kilimnik said. \u201cHe will be most likely looking for ways to reach out to you pretty soon.\u201d Manafort wrote that if Deripaska \u201cneeds private briefings we can accommodate.\u201d\n\nThe pair\u2019s emails on the topic grew vaguer and more cryptic as the summer continued. In late July, Kilimnik wrote to Manafort, \u201cI met today with the guy who gave you your biggest black caviar jar several years ago. We spent about 5 hours talking about his story, and I have several important messages from him to you.\u201d This, again, is believed to be about Deripaska, with \u201ccaviar\u201d thought to be code for money.\n\nKilimnik and Manafort arranged a meeting in New York City to discuss the matter on August 2 \u2014 Kilimnik wrote that he had a \u201clong caviar story\u201d to tell and \u201cseveral important messages.\u201d (They have claimed this meeting was unrelated to the US presidential campaign.)\n\nDeripaska took the now-infamous yacht trip with Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister a few days after this. \n\nManafort, unexpectedly, didn\u2019t end up lasting much longer on the Trump campaign \u2014 he was fired on August 19. But there are still a great many questions about what, exactly, happened between him, Kilimnik, and Deripaska beforehand.\n\nFurthermore, as Navalny points out, Vashukevich\u2019s posts provide what had been a missing link in this particular collusion theory. Navalny says in his video that though Deripaska was viewed as close to Putin, many oligarchs are, and the theory always lacked any indication that \u201cDeripaska transmits any information to him.\u201d\n\nYet now we know that just days after Deripaska seems to have had a very important conversation with Manafort\u2019s associate and sent important messages, Deripaska took a multi-day yacht trip with one of the highest-level officials in the Russian government, in which they discussed politics and the United States.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is surely very curious about the content of those discussions.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Emily Stewart", "body": "This week, Facebook looks like it\u2019s trying to give Russia the benefit of the doubt. Rob Goldman, vice president of ads at Facebook, used Twitter on Friday to applaud Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s indictments of multiple Russian people and companies for their interference in the 2016 election. Goldman said he also wanted to clear a few things up \u2014namely, that he doesn\u2019t believe that Russia\u2019s main goal was to sway the 2016 election. On Sunday, however, James Clapper, former director of national intelligence under the Obama administration, clapped back: of course Russia was trying to influence the election. Obviously both can\u2019t be true. \nGoldman\u2019s reasoning was based on the fact that a majority of Russian ad spending on Facebook happened after the election. \u201cThe main goal of the Russian propaganda and misinformation effort is to divide America by using our institutions, like free speech and social media, against us. It has stoked fear and hatred amongst Americans,\u201d Goldman wrote. \u201cIt is working incredibly well. We are quite divided as a nation.\u201d he wrote. The executive pointed to a Houston anti-Islamic protest in May: \u201cAmericans were literally puppeted into the streets by trolls who organized both sides of the protest,\u201d he said.

In an appearance on CNN\u2019s State of the Union with Dana Bash on Saturday, the general hit back at Goldman\u2019s assertion. \u201cWell, it\u2019s false, as far as I\u2019m concerned, because there\u2019s no question what the Russians were trying to do,\u201d Clapper said, noting that all evidence points to that being the case, whether you want to acknowledge it or not. \u201cClearly, the Russians were trying to affect the election.\u201d\nClapper said the Russians had three main goals in their campaign to interfere in American politics: \nFirst was simply to sow discord and discontent in this country. And, unfortunately, we\u2019re a good target for that right now. And, secondly, to hurt Hillary Clinton, which starts with this strong personal animus that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has for the Clintons, both, and then, of course, as things evolved, to support Trump.\nThere is one thing, however, that Clapper and Goldman seem to agree on: Russia is definitely going to try it again. \u201cThe Russian campaign is ongoing,\u201d Goldman wrote on Twitter on Friday. \u201cThey\u2019re going to continue to do it,\u201d Clapper said on Sunday.\nClapper also said he believes that more revelations are coming: \u201cI do think there are other shoes to drop here besides this indictment.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Andrew Prokop", "body": "It\u2019s now clear that special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation is now looking into a whole lot more than just Russia.\n\nA set of recent reports citing witnesses interviewed in Mueller\u2019s probe all suggest that the special counsel is pursuing angles related to potentially corrupt foreign influence on a wide range of people in Trump\u2019s orbit \u2014 with the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Turkey, and China all being mentioned as subjects of his investigators\u2019 questioning.\n\nFirst, CNN\u2019s Shimon Prokupecz, Kara Scannell, and Gloria Borger reported that Mueller was looking into Jared Kushner\u2019s efforts to get foreign investors for his family real estate company\u2019s projects during the transition \u2014 and that his investigators have asked witnesses about Kushner\u2019s talks with a Chinese insurance company and with a former prime minister of Qatar. \n\nThen, NBC News\u2019s Carol Lee, Julia Ainsley, and Robert Windrem reported that Mueller\u2019s team has also asked about Kushner\u2019s conversations with potential investors from Russia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 with an eye toward whether these business talks \u201clater shaped White House policies.\u201d (The report claims that Qatari officials claim to have evidence that Kushner coordinated with Gulf states to hurt Qatar, but have \u201cdecided against cooperating with Mueller for now out of fear it would further strain the country\u2019s relations with the White House.\u201d)\n\nThen, this weekend, the New York Times\u2019 Mark Mazzetti, David Kirkpatrick, and Maggie Haberman reported that businessman George Nader, an adviser to the United Arab Emirates government who visited the White House several times last year, had become a focus of Mueller\u2019s probe. Investigators have specifically asked \u201cabout any possible attempts by the Emiratis to buy political influence by directing money to support Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign,\u201d the Times reports.\n\nFinally, Axios\u2019s Jonathan Swan got a hold of a grand jury subpoena Mueller\u2019s team sent to a witness this February. The subpoena demands \u201call communications\u201d this person sent or received involving not only Trump himself, but nine other named Trump associates since November 1, 2015. In addition to the fact that the subpoena names many people, note that it is not limited in any way to Russia-related communications. \n\nAll this paints a picture of a very wide-ranging investigation that\u2019s investigating not just Russian interference with the 2016 campaign and Russian ties to Trump, but potentially corrupt foreign influence involving a wide circle of Trump associates.\n\nIs all this mainly about getting more leverage for the Russia case \u2014 or is Mueller pursuing something else big?\nNow, Mueller\u2019s investigation had already gone somewhat beyond Russia collusion, with last October\u2019s indictments of Paul Manafort and Rick Gates on charges based on work they did for Ukrainian politicians before the 2016 campaign. But Manafort and Gates worked for the faction of Ukrainian politicians aligned with the Kremlin, so this wasn\u2019t all that far removed from Russia. The recent reports indicate a far broader focus (though other reports make clear he\u2019s still also looking into the central question of Russian interference, too).\n\nThe big mystery, though, is whether Mueller is focusing on all these other topics mainly out of a desire to help him make a Russia-related case \u2014 or whether potential corruption related to Gulf countries and other foreign players are now a new focus in his investigation in and of itself.\n\nThe Manafort and Gates Ukraine charges, for instance, were widely believed to be pursued by Mueller\u2019s team primarily because he wanted one or both of them to \u201cflip\u201d (as Gates eventually did). So perhaps these new areas of inquiry are mainly aimed at getting more leverage over Trump associates, so they\u2019d feel pressure to cooperate and provide valuable Russia-related information. \n\nAlternatively, Mueller could have discovered something big in his investigation unrelated to Russia \u2014 through records he\u2019s uncovered, witnesses, or perhaps his three cooperating ex-Trump aides \u2014 that seems serious and important enough to merit him devoting his resources to it. \n\nBoth seem like possibilities. Mueller has 17 prosecutors on his team, so he can look into many things at the same time. Still, he hardly has unlimited resources, and the Russian interference topic is enormously complex. But whether his team is asking these questions to get Russia-related leverage, or to look into what could be an entirely new scandal, it\u2019s clear there\u2019s some reason behind it. Only the special counsel\u2019s team, however, knows what that is.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Ella Nilsen", "body": "In a stunning upset, Democrat Conor Lamb won an incredibly close special election in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District, beating out Republican candidate Rick Saccone in a deeply conservative district the nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates R+11.\n\nThe race stretched into Wednesday midday, when CNN said Lamb was in the lead with 627 votes, with 100 percent of precincts reporting. State law does not mandate a recount in district-level elections. \n\n\nConventional wisdom suggested that Saccone \u2014 a candidate who once declared himself \u201cTrump before Trump was Trump\u201d \u2014 would do well in a district that turned out in droves for President Donald Trump in 2016. But in recent weeks, Republicans were in full panic mode, dumping over $9 million into the race. Lamb\u2019s victory shows they were right to be so worried. \n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just Republicans who feared losing this district, it was Trump himself.\n\nIn many ways, PA-18 was emblematic of Trump\u2019s presidential success story; the president carried the district by 20 points in 2016, along with much of the rest of Western Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania was one of the blue-collar Rust Belt states he was never supposed to win, but won anyway, in a stunning rebuke to Hillary Clinton. \n\nAlong with Wisconsin and Michigan, the Keystone state carried Trump to victory on Election Day 2016. It\u2019s a story Trump often recounts at rallies, including the one he held for Saccone in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, on Saturday.\n\nVoting for Saccone is exactly what the president wanted his supporters to do. Trump cared enough about Saccone winning to join him on the campaign trail multiple times and send Vice President Mike Pence and members of his family, including son Donald Trump Jr. and daughter Ivanka Trump, to stump. \n\nHe even pushed a controversial announcement on steel and aluminum import tariffs to land a week before the special election. \n\nNone of it worked.\n\nTrump voters ended up either staying home, or proving they could just as easily cast their votes for a Democrat with the right message, especially when Trump wasn\u2019t the candidate on the ballot.\n\nConor Lamb won a district Democrats weren\u2019t supposed to be competitive in\nOn its face, Tuesday\u2019s special congressional election in the southwest corner of Pennsylvania was supposed to be a breeze for the GOP. The Cook Political Report rates the district R+11 (due in part to partisan gerrymandering that the state Supreme Court recently ruled unconstitutional).\n\nPolitical analysts in the state agreed that the district\u2019s gerrymandering was part of the reason it was supposed to be impossible for Democrats to win. This is a seat that used to be so solidly Republican, Democrats didn\u2019t even both competing in it. \n\nThe newly open seat was held by former Rep. Tim Murphy (R-PA) since 2003, who was so secure in his seat that he often failed to attract a Democratic challenger. Murphy suddenly resigned in October amid revelations that he had pressured a woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair to have an abortion. But even after he stepped down, national Democrats didn\u2019t think they could compete in the special election, one Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee operative told Vox.\n\nThat was, until Conor Lamb came along.\n\nA 33-year-old Marine and former assistant US attorney who prosecuted drug dealers in the midst of Pennsylvania\u2019s deadly opioid crisis, Lamb comes from a well-known political family in Pittsburgh, but is new to politics himself. \n\nHe has struck a decidedly independent tone throughout the campaign, making headlines when he said he would not support House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi as the Democratic leader if a blue wave sweeps the House in 2018, echoing his support for the 2nd Amendment, and telling voters he personally doesn\u2019t believe in abortion (though he supports Roe v. Wade as the law of the land).\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got local ties; he\u2019s a local guy,\u201d Tim Waters, political director for the United Steelworkers Political Action Committee told Vox. \u201cHe\u2019s a young guy with a lot of energy ... right down the line on issues that affect workers in this district.\u201d\n\nLamb\u2019s independent streak has also made it difficult for Republicans to attack him as a politician in step with Pelosi, although they\u2019ve certainly tried to. Republicans and conservative groups have mostly been trying to tie Lamb to the Democratic agenda.\n\nBut throughout the campaign, there was not a lot of evidence it was sticking. \n\nFocused almost exclusively on local issues, Lamb has nevertheless stumbled into a long-running debate about how the Democratic Party can claw its way back to the majority after 2016.\n\nTrying to recapture blue-collar workers, Lamb\u2019s campaign represents one school of thought \u2014 going back to labor-liberal economic values and working with unions to retake territory in Midwest and Rust Belt states that voted for Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nTrump and Lamb actually campaigned on many of the same core issues\nPA-18 is often characterized as a conservative district, but it has deep Democratic roots as well. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much a conservative district as it is an economic populist district,\u201d said longtime Pennsylvania Democratic consultant Mike Mikus. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to support the NRA down the line, but respect the right of people to own firearms ... and [be] someone that\u2019s willing to stand up to the national party when they feel it\u2019s in the interest of the district or the region.\u201d\n\nThere are technically 70,000 more registered Democrats in the 18th Congressional District than Republicans, but many of those voters have been casting ballots for GOP candidates for years. Mikus, who has worked on Democratic campaigns in the state for years, said Lamb successfully proved himself an independent.\n\n\u201cConor, I think so far, has done a fairly good job as portraying himself as someone that\u2019s going to fight for the region,\u201d Mikus said. \n\nLamb\u2019s campaign was not against Trump; the former federal prosecutor rarely mentioned the president at his events, instead focusing on issues like protecting entitlements like Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare, and ending Pennsylvania\u2019s opioid crisis \u2014 which Gov. Tom Wolf recently declared a state of emergency.\n\nIn other words \u2014 many of the same themes Trump echoed during his 2016 presidential campaign. \n\nFrom the beginning of his campaign, Trump vowed not to cut entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. Then, when he got into office, his 2019 budget proposed cutting Medicare by $236 billion over 10 years (those cuts have not been enacted). \n\nTrump promised many times to end the opioid crisis that\u2019s ravaging Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and other Rust Belt states and that in 2016 claimed more lives than the entire Vietnam War. \n\nThe president\u2019s response has been to declare the opioid epidemic a public health emergency, but little else. The administration has largely ignored the recommendations of Trump\u2019s opioids commission, Trump has twice tried to strip his Office of National Drug Control Policy of funding, and proposed a death penalty for drug dealers. Congress recently appropriated $6 billion for treatment, which experts say falls dramatically short of what\u2019s needed. \n\nEven so, Trump has remained relatively popular in the district. Saccone was unable to replicate that popularity for himself.\n\nThis special election was personal for Donald Trump\nAll special elections so far have been declared a referendum on Trump by pollsters and the media. But Pennsylvania is arguably one of the few the president actually cared about because the state was one of his greatest 2016 success stories.\n\nTrump won Pennsylvania by a little over 73,000 votes, 48.2 percent to Clinton\u2019s 47.5 percent. The roughly one-point percentage that separated the two candidates was seismic; it delivered Trump 20 electoral college votes and was part of the Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania trifecta that pushed him to the presidency. \n\nTrump was never supposed to win Pennsylvania; the fact he claimed the state in 2016 became an integral part of his narrative, one that he repeated at the Saturday Saccone rally.\n\n\u201cOn November 8, Pennsylvania is the state that gave us the 45th president of the United States,\u201d Trump said, as the crowd cheered.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re one of us!\u201d one crowd member yelled.\n\n\u201cThey said we couldn\u2019t get elected,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cI say we ... because some of you had never voted before, but you love the country. Remember, they said, \u2018You cannot win.\u2019 Remember the famous 270? Remember, they said he cannot get to 270. And we didn\u2019t, we got to 306.\u201d\n\nFor Republicans, there was a mad dash to pour cash into the race so they didn\u2019t embarrass themselves by losing a district that Democrats were never even supposed to be competitive in. But for Trump, the impetus was much more personal. \n\nTrump\u2019s push wasn\u2019t about Saccone, it was about hanging onto \u201cTrump country\u201d in Southwestern Pennsylvania \u2014 and with it, the very narrative that put him in the White House. For the president, who prizes loyalty, this race was the ultimate test. \n\n\u201cNormally I would not come, except it\u2019s Pennsylvania,\u201d Trump said on Saturday. \u201cI love Pennsylvania.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Umair Irfan", "body": "The $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill that needs to pass this week to avert a government shutdown increases spending on clean energy and keeps the Environmental Protection Agency funded at current levels.\n\nThat\u2019s despite the White House suggestion that Congress cut EPA\u2019s budget by one-third and make drastic reductions in clean energy research. \n\nTarak Shah, a former chief of staff  in the science and energy office at the US Department of Energy, told Vox the bill was an \u201cutter repudiation of the Trump budget!\u201d\n\nThe EPA will keep its $8.1 billion budget with a few changes, including $66 million allocated toward the Superfund program for cleaning up highly contaminated sites.\n\nThe Department of Energy\u2019s high-risk, high-reward research incubator, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, or ARPA-E, can also breathe easy. Trump\u2019s budget proposal recommended eliminating the popular program, but Congress gave it a $47 million boost up to $353 million. \n\nThe DOE\u2019s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy office, which the White House wanted to gut by $1.3 billion, also got a 15 percent increase to a new total of $2.3 billion. \n\nThere are also a few strange energy-related riders: The bill declares biomass as a carbon-neutral energy source, though scientists are still debating whether that\u2019s the case.

His replacement is John Bolton, the former ambassador to the United Nations in the Bush administration \u2014 and one of the most radically hawkish voices in American foreign policy.\n\nBolton has said the United States should declare war on both North Korea and Iran. He was credibly accused of manipulating US intelligence on weapons of mass destruction prior to the Iraq war and of abusive treatment of his subordinates. He once \u201cjoked\u201d about knocking 10 stories off the UN building in New York. That means his new appointment to be the most important national security official in the White House has significant \u2014 and frightening \u2014 implications for Trump\u2019s approach to the world.\n\nBolton\u2019s new job was announced on Thursday evening, when the president tweeted that McMaster planned to resign and Bolton would replace him. \u201cI am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, [John Bolton] will be my new National Security Advisor,\u201d the president wrote.\n\nBolton had been rumored to be the frontrunner for the job for months, but that doesn\u2019t make the pick any less jarring. His track record in government, connections to anti-Muslim groups, and stated views in op-eds and public speeches all suggest that he will push Trump to take extremely dangerous positions on issues like North Korea, Iran, and ISIS.\n\n\u201cI operate on the assumption that John Bolton should be kept as far away from the levers of foreign policy as possible,\u201d says Christopher Preble, the vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. \u201cI think I would rest easy if he was dog catcher in Stone Mountain, Georgia. But maybe not.\u201d\n\nBolton elevation illustrates the degree to which the president is influenced by the conservative infotainment sphere, most notably Fox News \u2014 where he has long been an on-air fixture. Bolton was, prior to this appointment, a marginal figure in Washington foreign policy circles since his departure from the Bush administration. But he got himself one of the top jobs in in the country because his savvy work in the world of conservative media and advocacy groups.\n\nAs a result, American foreign policy may be soon be shaped by someone who seems to truly believe that war is the answer to the world\u2019s most pressing problems.\n\nJohn Bolton\u2019s early career shows why he\u2019s a dangerous choice for national security adviser\nBolton is, somewhat ironically, a quintessential creature of the Washington swamp.\n\nAfter graduating Yale Law School in 1974, where he had become friends with future Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, he went into private practice in Washington. He made a name for himself working in conservative politics, becoming vice president of the right-wing American Enterprise Institute and serving in midlevel roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until the George W. Bush administration that Bolton rose to greater prominence. In May 2001, Bush appointed him to be undersecretary of state for arms control, basically the top diplomat focusing on weapons of mass destruction. This position became fairly important in the runup to the Iraq War, as the Bush administration\u2019s case against Saddam Hussein focused on his alleged nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons.\n\nBolton took the hardest of possible lines. He forcefully argued that Iraq had WMDs \u2014 \u201cwe are confident that Saddam Hussein has hidden weapons of mass destruction,\u201d as he put in one 2002 speech. After Bush\u2019s 2002 State of the Union speech connecting North Korea, Iraq, and Iran as an \u201caxis of evil,\u201d Bolton insisted that this wasn\u2019t just rhetoric \u2014 that there was \u2018\u2019a hard connection between these regimes \u2014 an \u2018axis\u2019 along which flow dangerous weapons and dangerous technology.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe was involved in shaping US intelligence in the runup to the war \u2014 and not in a good way. In 2002, Bolton\u2019s staff prepared a speech alleging that Cuba had an active biological weapons program. This wasn\u2019t true, and the State Department\u2019s lead bioweapons analyst at the time would not sign off on the claim. Per the analyst\u2019s sworn testimony to Congress, Bolton then called the analyst into his office, screamed at him, and then sent for his boss. In this conversation, per the Washington Post\u2019s David Ignatius, he derisively referred to the analyst as a \u201cmunchkin\u201d and attempted to get him transferred to a different department.\n\nThis was cruel and unprofessional, but also dangerous. Carl Ford, then the assistant secretary of state for intelligence and research, testified that Bolton\u2019s assault on the analyst had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d throughout the department, freezing out dissent on proliferation issues beyond Cuba. John Prados, a fellow at George Washington University\u2019s National Security Archives, came to an even broader conclusion in a study of declassified Bush administration documents: Bolton bears a significant amount of blame for the politicized intelligence used to justify the decision to attack Iraq.\n\n\u201cAlthough Bolton\u2019s actions did not concern Iraq directly, they came to a high point during the summer of 2002 \u2014 the exact moment when Iraq intelligence issues were on the front burner \u2014 and they aimed at offices which played a central role in producing Iraq intelligence,\u201d Prados writes. \u201cAnalysts working on Iraq intelligence could not be blamed for concluding that their own careers might be in jeopardy if they supplied answers other than what the Bush administration wanted to hear.\u201d\n\nNone of this got Bolton fired. In fact, it got him promoted: In March 2005, President Bush nominated him to be US ambassador to the UN, one of the most important diplomatic positions in the entire government.\n\nBolton\u2019s Senate confirmation hearing turned into a vicious fight, largely over his role in shaping the faulty prewar intelligence about Iraq. But his management style, as exemplified by the munchkin incident, also became a huge issue. When Ford was called to testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he bluntly said Bolton\u2019s personality should disqualify him from holding high office. Ford called him a \u201cbully\u201d who \u201ckisses up and punches down,\u201d among other things.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m as conservative as John Bolton is,\u201d Ford told the committee. \u201cBut the fact is that the collateral damage and the personal hurt that he causes is not worth the price that had to be paid.\u201d\n\nMultiple people who had worked with Bolton came out of the woodwork to speak to these issues. Perhaps the most harrowing such account came in an open letter written by a former federal contractor named Melody Townsel, recalling a time that she raised issues surrounding the use of funds in a contract Bolton was working on. He didn\u2019t take it well:\n\nMr. Bolton proceeded to chase me through the halls of a Russian hotel \u2014 throwing things at me, shoving threatening letters under my door and, generally, behaving like a madman. For nearly two weeks, while I awaited fresh direction from my company and from US AID, John Bolton hounded me in such an appalling way that I eventually retreated to my hotel room and stayed there. Mr. Bolton, of course, then routinely visited me there to pound on the door and shout threats.\n\nAll in all, according to then-Sen. Joe Biden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time, testimony from at least five people confirmed multiple instances of Bolton behaving abusively toward subordinates and retaliating against intelligence professionals who challenged his policy positions. For these reasons, Bolton could not be confirmed by the Senate \u2014 which was, at the time, controlled by Republicans.\n\nBolton\u2019s Iraq-era activities are extraordinarily relevant for understanding what he\u2019ll push for as Trump\u2019s national security adviser (a position that doesn\u2019t require Senate confirmation).\n\nTechnically, his primary job will be running the National Security Council, which exists to coordinate and synthesize the sometimes conflicting policy proposals that emerge from the Pentagon, State Department, and other agencies. He will present the president with strategic assessments of high-level officials like the secretaries of defense and state, offer his own thinking, and then communicate Trump\u2019s ultimate decision to the agencies and work to ensure it\u2019s implemented.\n\nPut another way, his job is to manage the information that comes to the president and then present a clear-eyed and accurate assessment of what\u2019s happening and how to respond to it. Yet Bolton\u2019s history suggests a long and storied history of cherry-picking intelligence to support his preferred hawkish policies.\n\n\u201cBolton is so much of an ideologue,\u201d says Eoyang. \u201c that I don\u2019t think he would accurately portray consequences [of policy options] to the president.\u201d\n\nHis reported history of berating and undermining anyone who attempted to challenge him is likely to further stifle dissent. He\u2019ll have more power over the White House national security staff as national security adviser than anyone other than the president, giving him unprecedented ability to act as a \u201cbully,\u201d in Ford\u2019s words.\n\nIt\u2019s very plausible that Bolton will accelerate the brain drain from the federal government that already seems to be taking shape \u2014 not just in the White House but across the various departments that make foreign policy.\n\n\u201cBolton hates the State Department. He portrays US diplomats as closet Democrats and appeasers,\u201d Richard Gowan, a professor at Columbia University who has studied Bolton\u2019s career, recalls. \u201cAs NSA, he would almost certainly encourage the hollowing out of State Trump and [former Secretary of State Rex] Tillerson have begun.\u201d\n\nJohn Bolton represents the Fox News-ification of foreign policy\nUltimately, Bolton did get the UN ambassador position \u2014 though without the Senate\u2019s permission. In August 2005, President Bush appointed him to the post while the Senate was out of session (a so-called \u201crecess appointment\u201d).\n\nBolton\u2019s year and a half at the UN was characterized by showy condemnations of the organization, which infuriated American allies, but he had little influence on the UN or the overall arc of Bush\u2019s second-term foreign policy.\n\n\u201cBolton raised hell at the UN, but his actual power was quite limited,\u201d Gowan recalls. \u201cCondi Rice and the mainstream conservatives in the second Bush administration often ignored him. He is quite open about this in his memoirs from that period, which are fun.\u201d\n\nIn December 2006, Bolton called it quits, returning to civilian life. He became a fixture on Fox News and conservative talk radio, where his confirmation fight and anti-UN rhetoric was hailed as a sign of his willingness to speak truth to power. He was so prominent in these spheres, mostly through his contract as a Fox contributor, that he considered running for president in both 2012 and 2016.\n\nBolton was particularly popular among a small but influential group of hardline anti-Islam activists, the \u201ccounter-jihad\u201d movement, who believed the US government was being infiltrated by Islamists and that Islamic law was quietly taking over the US legal system.\n\nBolton wrote the foreword to a book by two of the most prominent counter-jihadists, Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer, in 2010. In 2016, Bolton spoke at a conference held by the American Freedom Alliance, considered a \u201chate group\u201d by the Southern Poverty Law Center, titled \u201cCan Islam and the West Coexist?\u201d His speech contained a \u201cjoke\u201d whose punchline was that President Obama was a Muslim.\n\nIn his many media appearances and public appearances, Bolton never wavered from the kind of hawkish policy views he established during the Bush administration. In a 2015 New York Times op-ed, Bolton advocated for a US and/or Israeli airstrike on Iranian nuclear facilities. \u201cTime is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSuch action should be combined with vigorous American support for Iran\u2019s opposition, aimed at regime change in Tehran.\u201d\n\nSince Trump took office, Bolton has put the media savvy and experience with the conservative movement he\u2019s developed to good use \u2014 using various levers to influence the president. In just the first months of 2018, Bolton has appeared on Fox News roughly 20 times. He has used those appearances to sell his policy preferences, warning against diplomacy with North Korea and encouraging te Kingdom of Jordan to annex the West Bank (much of which remains under Israeli occupation despite the fact that the vast majority of its citizens are Palestinian).\n\nDuring the early Trump administration, then-White House senior strategist Steve Bannon approached Bolton as part of a plan to get around Cabinet members, like Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, who opposed withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. Bolton drafted a five-page memo detailing his proposal for tearing up the deal, which he then published in National Review after Bannon departed the White House.\n\nAnd in February 2018, he published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal arguing that the US needed to solve the nuclear standoff with North Korea by force.\n\n\u201cPre-emption opponents argue that action is not justified because Pyongyang does not constitute an \u2018imminent threat.\u2019 They are wrong,\u201d Bolton wrote. \u201cIt is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current \u2018necessity\u2019 posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons by striking first.\u201d\n\nBolton\u2019s record in the Bush administration and general hawkishness made him a marginal figure in Washington foreign policy conversations. So after leaving, he cannily aligned himself with Fox News and other influential groups on the right, like the counter-jihadists, who saw him as an experienced and credible commentator. This led not only to television news and book contracts but to platforms through which he could potentially influence actual Republican elected officials.\n\nThis reached a kind of apogee with President Trump. Trump sees the world through a televisual lens; he seems to get more information from Fox News than from his daily intelligence briefings. The president values the advice of people he sees on the TV and other friendly media outlets. Bolton is not seen as a relic of the hated Bush administration; he\u2019s seen as an authoritative and expert Fox voice. According to Bolton\u2019s National Review piece, Trump once told him to \u201ccome in and see me any time\u201d in the White House.\n\nNow, of course, Bolton will have a permanent home in the White House. The reason he didn\u2019t have an administration sooner, according to some press accounts, is aesthetic. In December 2016, the Washington Post reported that Bolton was eliminated from the running for secretary of state because Trump \u2014 I swear I\u2019m not making this up \u2014 didn\u2019t like his mustache.\n\n\u201cDonald was not going to like that mustache,\u201d one Trump associate told the Post. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone that\u2019s really close to Donald that has a beard that he likes.\u201d\n\nPerhaps because of the mustache, Trump hadn\u2019t taken Bolton\u2019s policy advice to heart in his first year in office. There\u2019s no war with North Korea, and the Iran deal remains (largely) intact.\n\nBut now Bolton is national security adviser, with direct access to the president and tremendous influence over a vast and powerful national security bureaucracy. And many foreign policy experts are deeply concerned about what that means. \n\n\u201cThe United States has not hit rock bottom in our international relations,\u201d says Eoyang. \u201c[With Bolton], we could go lower.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Dara Lind", "body": "Donald Trump likes to portray himself as a leader \u2014 a decisive figure who gets things done. Nowhere is that more true than on immigration, the issue that made his political career. \n\nThat\u2019s the spirit in which he offered an eleventh-hour threat to veto the omnibus spending bill passed by Congress this week (which would keep the government open until the end of September). He claimed that he\u2019d veto the bill because it didn\u2019t contain enough money for his wall on the US/Mexico border \u2014 and because it didn\u2019t address the fate of the 690,000 unauthorized immigrants facing the loss of their protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\n\n\nI am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2018\n\n\n\n\nBut then he turned around and agreed to sign the bill anyway, just a few hours later. Which proves the underlying truth of Trump\u2019s immigration stance: his efforts at \u201cleadership\u201d are just temper tantrums.\n\nTrump\u2019s temper tantrums have, time and again, blown up efforts to find a permanent solution for DACA recipients. His last-minute attempt to use them as cover for an impulsive veto threat was transparently bullshit. And what made it all the more insulting was that he used them for a threat that he was inevitably, and quickly, going to abandon.\n\nIf Donald Trump cared about DACA recipients, he had better ways of showing it\nIf Donald Trump is really seriously concerned about a permanent solution for DACA recipients, here are some things he could have done:\n\n\nHe could have told Congress to pass a permanent solution for DACA recipients in September without winding down the program.\nHe could have stuck to his initial agreement with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to sign a bill that offered legal status to DACA recipients even if it didn\u2019t include any increases in immigration enforcement. \nHe could have accepted the deal proposed by a group of senators in January, designed to address Trump\u2019s four \u201cpillar\u201d immigration demands, instead of rejecting it for taking too many people from \u201cshithole countries.\u201d\n\nHe could have stuck to his (reportedly) tentative agreement with Schumer to sign a bill that would give citizenship to DREAMers in exchange for $25 billion for the wall over 10 years.\nHe could have agreed to support a bill proposed by a different bipartisan group of senators, which ended up getting over 50 votes in the Senate \u2014 much more than Trump\u2019s preferred bill got \u2014 and almost certainly would have passed that chamber had Trump endorsed it.\nHe could have told congressional Republicans at any time in the past several weeks that he wouldn\u2019t sign an omnibus bill that didn\u2019t at least extend DACA protections.\n\nHe did none of those things. Whether or not Donald Trump actually cares about the fate of DACA recipients, it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that he cares less about them than he does about getting his way.\n\nTrump just proved that Congress shouldn\u2019t take his threats seriously\nFor many congressional Republicans, the takeaway from the last several months of immigration drama has been that Trump can\u2019t actually be relied upon to make deals. \n\nHe throws out demands, then abandons them without a thought. He says he wants a deal and doesn\u2019t care about the specifics, then rejects a deal because it doesn\u2019t meet his specifications. \n\nThis is why congressional Republicans didn\u2019t line up behind the White House over the weekend, when it asked for $25 billion for the wall in exchange for three years\u2019 more protection for DACA recipients; Democrats rejected the proposal out of hand, and Republicans weren\u2019t willing to shut down the government over something just because the White House came up with it. \n\nIt\u2019s why Congress sent Trump a spending bill that didn\u2019t defund sanctuary cities, which was the White House\u2019s initial line in the sand for threatening a veto: they thought Trump would back down, and he did.\n\nAnd it\u2019s why Congress didn\u2019t respond to Trump\u2019s eleventh-hour veto threat over the wall and DACA with a scramble to make a deal. They haven\u2019t been able to make a deal on those issues because whenever Trump has said he wants a deal, he rejects the deal in front of him. Congress bet that this time, he didn\u2019t want a deal badly enough to shut down the government over it \u2014 that the passing fancy he tweeted the morning after Congress had voted on the bill would be gone by the afternoon.

He was in office for a little over a year, one of the shortest tenures in modern history \u2014 and it was not, experts say, a distinguished one.\n\n\u201cTillerson would be at or near the bottom of the list of secretaries of state, not just in the post-Second World War world but in the record of US secretaries of state,\u201d says Paul Musgrave, a scholar of US foreign policy at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.\n\nThe former ExxonMobil CEO, whose nomination was initially greeted warmly by prominent foreign policy hands, will leave without any major accomplishments. This is largely because he failed to wield any significant influence in internal administration debates over issues like North Korea or Russia, in fact actively alienating the president during several key policy debates. \n\nHis push to slash \u201cinefficiencies\u201d in the State Department and seeming disinterest in working closely with longtime staff were even more damaging. Under Tillerson\u2019s watch, 60 percent of State\u2019s top-ranking career diplomats resigned and new applications to join the foreign service fell by half, according to a November count by the American Foreign Service Association. This hollowing out of the foreign service, combined with Tillerson\u2019s inability to appoint people to vital positions like Ambassador to South Korea, delayed American responses to major crises and weakened the State Department for a \u201cgeneration,\u201d according to George Washington University\u2019s Elizabeth Saunders. \n\nThis can\u2019t all be blamed on Tillerson: even a skilled and experienced diplomat would have had trouble maintaining influence in the chaotic Trump White House, a place where foreign policy is often made by tweet. As if to underscore the point, Trump announced Tillerson\u2019s departure in a tweet \u2014 before the secretary himself could make a statement.\n\nYet scholars and foreign policy practitioners across the political spectrum agree that he deserves much of the blame.\n\n\"I think he really will go down as one of the worst secretaries of State we've had,\" Eliot Cohen, counselor to the State Department under President George W. Bush, told Axios\u2019 Jonathan Swan. \u201cHe will go down as the worst Secretary of State in history,\u201d tweeted Ilan Goldenberg, an Obama-era State Department official.\n\nTillerson was expected by many to be one of the \u201cadults in the room,\u201d helping Secretary of Defense James Mattis rein in some of Trump\u2019s most wild ideas. His attempts to play that role backfired \u2014 his ham-handed attempts to manage Trump alienated the president, who has reportedly complained about his \u201ctotally establishment\u201d views on foreign policy. \n\nWhen you combine the lack of influence over Trump with Tillerson\u2019s dismantling of the State Department\u2019s staff \u2014 he made more of a mess of the department in a shorter amount of time than any other secretary of state in history \u2014 you have a truly disastrous tenure in Foggy Bottom.\n\n\u201cHe took the job and made it smaller,\u201d Musgrave says.\n\nTillerson failed at the thing he was supposed to be good at\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        (Leon Neal/Getty Images)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nWhen Trump announced Tillerson as his pick for secretary of state, back in December 2016, the foreign policy community was of two minds on the appointment. \n\nAs CEO of ExxonMobil, one of the world\u2019s largest corporations, Tillerson seemed to be more than qualified to effectively manage a sprawling bureaucracy like the State Department. Mainstream GOP foreign policy experts like former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and former National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley all praised the pick.\n\n\"He would bring to the position vast knowledge, experience and success in dealing with dozens of governments and leaders in every corner of the world,\u201d Gates said in a statement. \"He is a person of great integrity whose only goal in office would be to protect and advance the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nCritics, though, worried about his close relationship with Vladimir Putin and Exxon\u2019s willingness to strike deals with corrupt foreign dictators and history of lobbying against action climate change (though the corporation now says it accepts climate science). During his January confirmation hearings, senators grilled him about both Russia and climate, with Democrats clearly unsatisfied by his answers.\n\n\"Do you lack the knowledge to answer my question, or refuse to answer my question?\" Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) puffed, after Tillerson repeatedly stonewalled his questions about Exxon funding climate change denial. \"A little of both,\u201d Tillerson replied.\n\nTillerson was confirmed in late January 2017 nonetheless, in a vote that basically fell along party lines. Quickly, he set about upending everyone\u2019s views about him. As soon as March, it had become clear that the convention wisdom was 100 percent wrong. The fears about Tillerson\u2019s policy views had proven overblown, mostly because he had been completely overshadowed in internal White House deliberations over issues like Syria and Russia.\n\n\u201cMore than a month after he became America\u2019s top diplomat, Rex Tillerson is like no other modern secretary of State: he\u2019s largely invisible,\u201d the LA Times\u2019 Tracy Wilkinson reported at the time. \u201cHis influence at the White House is difficult to discern. He appears to be competing with Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, and Stephen Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist, both of whom have Trump\u2019s ear on foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThe optimism about Tillerson\u2019s management acumen, by contrast, had clearly been badly misplaced. Tillerson failed to place political appointees in a number of vital leadership positions, failed to spend a lot of time with his own employees, and pushed out longtime employees without clear replacements in mind. Morale inside the organization collapsed.\n\n\u201cI used to love my job,\u201d one staffer told The Atlantic\u2019s Julia Ioffe at the time. \u201cNow, it feels like coming to the hospital to take care of a terminally ill family member. You come in every day, you bring flowers, you brush their hair, paint their nails, even though you know there\u2019s no point. But you do it out of love.\u201d\n\nWhat was true in March remained true for the rest of Tillerson\u2019s brief tenure. On issue after issue, Tillerson proved to be out-of-touch with the president\u2019s foreign policy positions.\n\nThe US bombed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in early April \u2014 just days after Tillerson suggested the administration would be fine with Assad staying in power. On June 9, Tillerson called on Saudi Arabia and its allies to end their isolation of Qataraaa; less than two hours later, Trump sided with the Saudis by labeling Qatar \u201ca funder of terrorism at a very high level.\u201d On July 20, after a meeting in which the president reportedly asked for a major expansion of America\u2019s nuclear arsenal, Tillerson told aides that the president was a moron \u2014 or, according to some reports, a \u201cfucking moron.\u201d One time, Tillerson tried to open the door to negotiations with North Korea \u2014 and Trump slapped him down in a tweet.\n\nThe staffing problem at the State Department remained bad throughout Tillerson\u2019s tenure, and in some ways got even worse. Only 64 out of 153 political appointees had confirmed by the Senate, according to a count by the Washington Post and Partnership for Public Service. He had not nominated anyone to be the assistant secretary supervising vital regions like Asia and the Middle East, nor did he nominate ambassadors for countries as important as Saudi Arabia and South Korea. \n\nThis kind of vacancy is devastating. \n\nPolitical appointees are necessary to shape policy, as they serve as a conduit between the administration and foreign governments. Without people in these positions, career diplomats fill in as best they can, but they have a hard time making new decisions or formulating new policy. It\u2019s nigh-unprecedented to go this long with this many vacancies because it cripples America\u2019s ability to develop diplomatic stances on vital issues. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not like this was a quiet time. During Tillerson\u2019s tenure, tensions over North Korea\u2019s nuclear program got so bad that war started to seem like a real possibility \u2014 and then President Trump decided to sit down with Kim Jong Un for the first-ever direct negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang. One US ally in the Gulf (Saudi Arabia) laid economic siege to another (Qatar). Russia apparently poisoned a double agent on British soil.\n\n\u201cWhen I was assistant secretary, I was sworn in early April [of the first year],\u201d says Hank Cohen, the Assistant Secretary of State for Africa under George H.W. Bush. \u201cIt\u2019s a big problem.\u201d\n\nAnd even the career staff suffered under Tillerson. He eliminated entire segments of the department, like the department that tracked war crimes. He imposed limits on transfers inside the organization, typically a way the State Department deals with staffing shortages, in late June. He publicly defended a Trump administration proposal to cut his department\u2019s budget by 30 percent, and at the time of his departure was pushing a plan to cut the permanent staff by eight percent despite repeated rebukes from Congress. He cut the department off from vital recruiting sources, like the Presidential Management Fellow program.\n\n\u201cSecretary Tillerson\u2019s term has led to widespread demoralization in the foreign service, the dismissal or resignation of people with expertise that individually may not be irreplaceable but as a cohort certainly becomes so,\u201d Musgrave says. \u201cThat hinders the State Department\u2019s ability to enhance US interests through diplomacy.\u201d\n\nThe consequences may not be visible immediately. But the State Department\u2019s personnel shortfalls could prevent the United States from successfully reaching a diplomatic solution to issues in everything ranging from the South China Sea to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. You can\u2019t negotiate very well if you don\u2019t have people who know how to do it \u2014 and more people the State Department loses, the longer-term the consequences of these problems are, as there\u2019s no one to promote to senior roles.\n\nSaunders analogizes the US under Tillerson\u2019s emaciated State Department to a person who doesn\u2019t have health insurance. \u201cYour life is probably fine \u2014 up until the point you get sick,\u201d she says.\n\nThe source of Tillerson\u2019s failures are both Trump and his own choices\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Tillerson (L), Trump, and Mattis.\n      \n      \n        (Michael Reynolds-Pool/Getty Images)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nWhy did things go so wrong for Tillerson?\n\nSome of the blame has to be paid at his boss\u2019 feet. Trump is running a chaotic administration that has nominated a shockingly low number of political appointees across practically every department. The White House shot down so many of Tillerson\u2019s picks for top deputies that he actually screamed at a group of White House aides during a meeting. Trump personally displayed little-to-no interest in learning from the expertise of State Department personnel, preferring instead to push his own pet priorities, like weakening the Iran deal and withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord.\n\n\u201cIt may be that, in a Trump administration, the structural realities of the way the White House works you can only choose among varieties of failure,\u201d Musgrave says.\n\nBut that excuse only goes so far. Secretary of Defense James Mattis hasn\u2019t been immune to Trump\u2019s bizarre management style \u2014 he was blindsided, most notably, by Trump\u2019s proposal to ban transgender people from serving in the military \u2014 but on the whole has been far more effective at advocating for his department\u2019s interests and gaining influence over the president\u2019s decision-making.\n\nYou can say that this is because Trump has more respect for generals that diplomats, and that\u2019s partially true. Another part of it is that Mattis seemed better at handling Trump\u2019s mercurial nature; according the New York Times, Tillerson frequently annoyed the president in meeting  by (among other things) saying \u201cit\u2019s your deal\u201d whenever Trump overruled him.\n\nBut a third and vital part of it, experts say, is that Mattis \u2014 a career military professional and former general \u2014 is substantially better at working in Washington. In particular, Mattis understood that working closely with his staff in the Pentagon allowed him to advance policy ideas through the bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cMattis is drawing on the expertise of his building. Some of that is a product of [his own] experience,\u201d Saunders says. \u201cTillerson is not a creature of his building, nor is he a creature of government at all.\u201d\n\nBy most accounts, Tillerson failed to build relationships with people in Foggy Bottom, relying instead on an insular inner-circle made up of a few longtime confidantes. This decision \u201cconstitutes the core of his failure,\u201d according to Musgrave: it made it hard both for Tillerson to garner influence inside the White House and to understand what his staff could do and how to deploy them effectively.\n\n\u201cTillerson had a half-dozen, maybe a dozen aides who are not familiar with Washington and especially not familiar with the State Department,\u201d Musgrave says. \u201cBut he seems to rely on these people who are loyal to him, known to him, at the expense of building relationships with the people in the building.\u201d\n\nPerhaps if Tillerson had developed closer relationships with State\u2019s career staff, he would have understood supporting budget cuts to his own department and staff downsizing would demoralize them. Perhaps he would have been able to develop new ideas that would have gotten the president\u2019s ear. Perhaps he would have been more able to convince the White House to trust his judgment on political appointees.\n\nPerhaps, perhaps, perhaps. But the truth is we won\u2019t know because Tillerson, to a degree nearly unprecedented in State\u2019s history, failed to even try to work with his own department.\n\nAll of which begs the question: Why did this multi-millionaire leave his cushy job at the head of one of the world\u2019s largest corporations and then take a job at a government bureaucracy he didn\u2019t understand and seemingly didn\u2019t respect?\n\nIt\u2019s a question only Tillerson can answer.

I resent the fact they\u2019re misleading.\u201d (He also said he resented \u201cthe fact of the [$139,000] doors.\u201d)\n\nControversy swirled again when, in an effort to rebuild Puerto Rico\u2019s battered grid after Hurricane Maria, the island\u2019s governor inked a deal with a little-known contractor from Zinke\u2019s hometown funded by a donor to President Trump instead of invoking mutual aid agreements with other utilities right away. \n\nAllegations of political favoritism and loyalty to industry are recurring themes in five of Zinke\u2019s biggest decisions to date, which affect the lives of millions of Americans. \n\n\n1) Opening the bulk of the US coast to oil and gas drilling \n\nIn January, Zinke announced a proposal to allow offshore oil and gas drilling around most of the United States, including in water off the coasts of California and Maine and the eastern Gulf of Mexico. \n\nThe five-year proposal, from 2019 to 2024, would open up about 90 percent of the region known as the Outer Continental Shelf \u2014 the biggest offshore lease sale ever. \n\nThis is great if you\u2019re in the oil industry. If the draft proposal goes through, energy companies will be able to bid on 47 lease auctions in 25 \u201cplanning areas\u201d along the edges of the lower 48 states and Alaska.\n\nBut not everyone is thrilled by the decision. Florida Gov. Rick Scott, for example, immediately asked to meet with Zinke.\n\n\nShortly after Scott objected, Zinke removed Florida from the draft proposal because Florida is \u201cunique and its coasts are heavily reliant on tourism as an economic driver.\u201d (Many interpreted it as a brazen political favor to Scott.) Now 12 other states want out.\n\nThis new offshore drilling announcement comes shortly after the new Republican tax law became a Trojan horse for new drilling in the Arctic. \n\nOpening up the coastal area of Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) for oil development was the key to securing a \u201cyes\u201d vote from Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) on the GOP tax package.  \n\nThe federal government is now required to complete at least two oil and gas lease sales in  ANWR over the next decade. \n\n\n2) The largest rollback in federal land protections in history\n\nIn December, Trump moved ahead with recommendations from Zinke and announced that his administration will roll back federal protections on 2 million acres of land in two national monuments in Utah, the Bears Ears monument and the Grand Staircase-Escalante monument.\n\nThe move, Trump said, is to \u201cto reverse federal overreach and restore the rights of this land to your citizens.\u201d But he also hinted at a financial upside for certain parties, claiming that federal oversight has led to \u201cunnecessary restrictions on hunting, ranching, and responsible economic development.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times recently obtained emails from the Department of Interior that show the Trump administration had an interest in oil and gas opportunities in the area before the sites were publicly reviewed last spring. One email details a map that would \u201cresolve all known mineral conflicts\u201d on protected land that Utah public schools wanted to lease out by changing the border of the Bears Ears monument. \n\nBears Ears \u2014 which was designated by President Barack Obama in one of his last acts in office \u2014 stands to lose 1.1 million acres, or 85 percent, of its land area. The Grand Staircase-Escalante monument would be reduced by 800,000 acres, or 45 percent. The rollback is the first step to opening up these lands to more industrial development and agriculture, breaking Bears Ears into two separate monuments and Grand Staircase-Escalante into three.\n\n\u201cThis type of reversal of executive action generates serious instability for anyone who depends on the resource or landscape one way or another,\u201d Adam Sowards says. \u201cFlip-flopping executive actions is no recipe for solving problems, stabilizing policy, or protecting the environment.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Sowards wrote in High Country News, one president rescinding another president\u2019s action isn\u2019t the sort of separation of powers founders envisioned. \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Michael Nigro/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThe administration is stepping into uncharted legal territory with this decision. There\u2019s never been a ruling on whether a president can decrease the size of a national monument. Five Native American tribes have joined in a lawsuit charging that the president has no power to decrease the size of national monuments like Bears Ears. (A separate lawsuit filed by 10 environmental groups makes a similar argument, but for the Grand Staircase-Escalante monument.) \n\nThe Interior department doesn\u2019t see its attempt to revoke the monuments\u2019 status as a \u201csale\u201d of public land. Zinke\u2019s press secretary says in an email to Vox that, \u201cSecretary Zinke is opposed to the sale or transfer of federal lands and has not sold or transferred a single acre of land except where Congress has mandated or where land swaps were arranged. In fact, the Secretary has expanded the federal estate by approving land acquisitions and swaps.\u201d\n\n\n3) A proposal to raid the National Petroleum Reserve\n\nInterior is also trying to open up the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A) in pursuit of the Trumpian goal of \u201cenergy dominance.\u201d NPR-A is the largest federally owned land unit in the United States. There have been 12 sales there since 1999, but the proposed lease sale of 10.3 million acres in the reserve would be the largest ever for that area of federal land. \n\nWhy is this land needed? Zinke has said that the management plan developed by the previous administration for the land is overly restrictive, and Alaska lawmakers have had their eye on it. \u201c...exploration and development of the NPR-A offers a promising opportunity to fill TAPS (the Trans Alaska Pipeline System), boost Alaska\u2019s economy, and protect America\u2019s energy security,\u201d Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) said when the Bureau of Land Management announced the sale. \n\nBut environmental activists are concerned about the spread of oil development at NPR-A, particularly the potential damage that could be done to such a huge area of protected land with so many unique ecosystems.\n\n\n4) Land protections are for the birds\n\nIn 2015, the Obama administration came to an agreement with Western states, oil and gas companies, and environmentalists about how to protect the greater sage grouse, the largest grouse in North America, and its fragile sagebrush habitat across the West. It was, by many accounts, the biggest conservation collaboration in US history, involving 15 planning areas in 10 states and costing $45 million.\n\nBut in June 2017, the Interior Department took steps to begin rolling back the current agreement, which limits oil and gas development and other commercial activities on federally owned land in 10 states that has been recognized as territory for these birds. \n\nThen, according to Sierra, the magazine of the Sierra Club, \u201cA month later, the Western Energy Alliance, an oil and gas industry trade group, sent Zinke a letter [about the plans] in which the word \u2018burdensome\u2019 occurred seven times in four pages. When Zinke\u2019s review was completed in August, it included or addressed 13 of the alliance\u2019s 15 requests for changes, sometimes almost word for word.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration didn\u2019t give Endangered Species Act protections to the bird in 2015, partly because this land management plan was already released earlier that year, according to the Hill. The Interior Department is expected to amend the greater sage grouse plans later this year, but the regulatory process is likely to take years.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Helen H. Richardson/The Denver Post via Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n5)  Greenlighting new roads in the wilderness\n\nThe Washington Post reported in early January that the Interior Department approved a land swap deal that will allow a road to be built through Izembek National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. The road, which will connect the small villages of King Cove and Cold Bay, would cut through 492 square miles of preserved wetland and coastal habitat. If this plan goes through, it would be the first time that a new road is built through federally protected wilderness. \n\nKing Cove residents have requested a 12-mile gravel road be built to improve their access to the closest all-weather airport to reach hospitals in Anchorage. Throughout the decades-long fight, opponents have highlighted the fact that the road would benefit a private company, connecting the Peter Pan Seafood company in King Cove to the airport in King Bay. \n\nThe US government has already spent more than $50 million on alternative solutions like a local clinic and a hovercraft, according to the Washington Post. \n\nEnvironmental advocacy groups point out that there are federal laws against creating new roads through protected areas of land, and they\u2019re prepared to put up a fight. \n\nIn 2013, the New York Times reported, Obama\u2019s Interior Secretary Sally Jewell \u201cfound that a road would cause irreparable harm to Izembek\u2019s ecology and wildlife, including the grizzly bear, caribou and geese for whom the refuge is a critical habitat.\u201d\n\nSecretary Zinke made the road construction official on January 22. \n\nClarification: An earlier version of this story wasn\u2019t clear about how Interior can open up public land for development.

It turns out the hacker who caused chaos in the United States elections made a small but critical error that allowed U.S. investigators to trace his identity:\n\n\nBut on one occasion, The Daily Beast has learned, Guccifer failed to activate the VPN client before logging on. As a result, he left a real, Moscow-based Internet Protocol address in the server logs of an American social media company, according to a source familiar with the government\u2019s Guccifer investigation. Twitter and WordPress were Guccifer 2.0\u2019s favored outlets. Neither company would comment for this story, and Guccifer did not respond to a direct message on Twitter.\n\nWorking off the IP address, U.S. investigators identified Guccifer 2.0 as a particular GRU officer working out of the agency\u2019s headquarters on Grizodubovoy Street in Moscow. (The Daily Beast\u2019s sources did not disclose which particular officer worked as Guccifer.)\n\n\nThe Guccifer 2.0 revelation is a big deal for a few reasons. 1) It piles on to the evidence that Russia attempted to interfere in the U.S. elections. 2) It raises more questions about the Trump campaign\u2019s connections to Russia, given the well-documented chats between Guccifer 2.0 and Trump adviser and surrogate Roger Stone. 3) Finally, it could mark a development in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, though Mueller\u2019s office declined to comment for the Daily Beast\u2019s story.\n\nAttributing Guccifer 2.0 to Russian military intelligence means Mueller can charge someone\nIn February, Mueller indicted 13 Russian nationals tied to the Internet Research Agency, accusing them of spreading propaganda to interference and influence the U.S. elections. It\u2019s highly unlikely that those Russians will ever see the inside of a U.S. courtroom, but the indictments laid out a compelling case against the Kremlin.\n\nThose indictments did not tackle other elements of Russia alleged cyber campaign against the U.S., including the hack of the DNC and the subsequent dumps on Wikileaks. But if U.S. authorities have attributed Guccifer 2.0 to a specific member of Russian military intelligence, Mueller likely has the ability to charge him or her.\n\nThe Daily Beast reports that Mueller has, in fact, taken over the investigation into Guccifer 2.0, and has brought the investigators who tracked the officer down onto his team. \n\nIt\u2019s unclear what, if anything, might come next. But it will be much harder for Trump, or his defenders, to blame the hack on just a \u201ca 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.\u201d That goes for Stone, who tried to push the narrative that Guccifer 2.0 was a random dude, not the Russians, and released messages the two exchanged to debunk the Kremlin connection.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and other top law enforcement officials are hosting a press conference Friday morning to cover a \u201cmajor cyber law enforcement announcement.\u201d It is reportedly not Mueller related, but the timing sure is interesting.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jen Kirby", "body": "President Donald Trump teased a veto before signing the massive $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill on Thursday. He did so, at least in his telling, reluctantly and with plenty of grievances against Congress and Democrats about what was in the bill and what wasn\u2019t. \n\nTrump also proposed a few solutions to avoid this problem for future spending bills, one of which included Congress giving him the power of a line-item veto. That would let the head of the executive branch essentially take a red pen to legislators\u2019 work, editing out the parts he doesn\u2019t like.\n\n\u201cTo prevent the omnibus situation from ever happening again,\u201d Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for a government spending bills.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s only one problem: Congress tried that before, and the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional. Presidents retain the veto power, of course, but it\u2019s all or nothing \u2014 they can\u2019t pick and choose which parts of the legislation they want to sign. \n\nThe Supreme Court declared the line-item veto unconstitutional almost 20 years ago. The challenge came during the Clinton administration, after the Congress passed the short-lived Line Item Veto Act of 1996, which gave the president the power to scratch certain items from spending and tax bills. \n\nCongress supported the law as a way to cut back on waste and pork-barrel spending in an attempt to get the federal deficit under control \u2014 though, as the Washington Post reported in 1998, lawmakers\u2019 enthusiasm \u201ccooled\u201d after Clinton started nixing some legislators\u2019 favored projects. Clinton used the power 82 times on 11 laws, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe challenge to the line-item veto came from New York City and its health care and hospital workers, after the president struck down a tax break tied to Medicaid funding; and from Idaho potato farmers, who fought back after Clinton knocked off a beneficial provision in a tax bill. \n\nThe Supreme Court ruled 6 to 3, in Clinton v. City of New York, that the line-item veto was unconstitutional because it gave unilateral power to the president to amend the text of laws \u2014 which is the legislative branch\u2019s, not the president\u2019s, territory. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion, saying line-item vetoes are \u201cthe functional equivalent of partial repeals of acts of Congress.\u201d \n\n\u201cThere is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the president to enact, to amend or to repeal statutes,\u201d he added.\n\nBasically, the Supreme Court said, it\u2019s up to Congress to get rid of the wasteful spending themselves, and send the final product to the president for him to sign, or reject, in full. If they didn\u2019t like this process, then they\u2019d have to amend the Constitution.\n\nThe line-item veto has been something presidents have wanted apparently since at least Ulysses S. Grant, and many governors do have line-item veto power for appropriations bills in their states. Other presidents have tried to bring back the idea in some form since the Supreme Court\u2019s 1998 decision. \n\nBush made an attempt in 2006, trying to re-write the law so Congress could override a line-item veto with a simple majority, rather than a two-thirds vote (which is needed to override a regular old presidential veto.) Obama considered asking in 2010.

But their technology was fake. \n\nMattis not only served on Theranos\u2019s board during some of the years it was perpetrating the fraud, after he retired from US military service, he earlier served as a key advocate of putting the company\u2019s technology (technology that was, to be clear, fake) to use inside the military while he was still serving as a general. Holmes is settling the case, paying a $500,000 fee and accepting various other penalties, while Balwani is fighting it out in court. \n\nNobody on the board is being directly charged with doing anything. But accepting six-figure checks to serve as a frontman for a con operation is the kind of thing that would normally count as a liability in American politics. \n\nBut nobody wants to talk about it. Not just Trump and his co-partisans in Congress, but the Democratic Party opposition is also inclined to give Mattis a pass. Everyone in Washington is more-or-less convinced that his presence in the Pentagon is the only thing standing between us and possible nuclear Armageddon. \n\nIt\u2019s an absurd, intolerable situation, but that\u2019s life in America in 2018 \u2014 and a perfect illustration of how Trump\u2019s unfitness for office exerts a corrosive influence throughout American life. \n\nJames Mattis profited off helping Theranos perpetrate a fraud\nTheranos was the kind of story that a lot of people wanted to believe in. A technology startup led by a bright, young Stanford dropout that unlike so many essentially frivolous apps was actually going to solve the urgent problem of making health care cheaper and easier to access. The basic problem, as exposed by the Wall Street Journal\u2019s John Carreyrou in an October 2015 expos\u00e9, was that the whole thing was a sham. \n\nTheranos\u2019s key technology, the Edison, didn\u2019t really work, and Theranos wasn\u2019t actually using it to perform its blood tests, relying instead on older Samsung equipment. They offered lower prices than the competition not because they had an innovative new product, but because they were a money-losing startup burning cash raised from venture capitalists. \n\nThis scheme worked because Theranos was deeply tied in with the American political, business, and media establishment \u2014 counting former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George Shultz as board members, and maintaining enough clout that Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign was unwise enough to schedule a high-profile fundraiser with Holmes months after the publication of Carreyrou\u2019s expos\u00e9. \n\nBut perhaps none of these elite supporters was as valuable as Mattis. \n\nAs the SEC complaint describes, a main element of the fraud was that \u201cHolmes, and Balwani claimed that Theranos\u2019 products were deployed by the U.S. Department of Defense on the battlefield in Afghanistan and on medevac helicopters and that the company would generate more than $100 million in revenue in 2014.\u201d \n\nHolmes, the SEC alleged, \u201cknew, or was reckless in not knowing, that these statements were false and misleading.\u201d It\u2019s easy to see, however, why investors might be fooled about this because one of the company\u2019s board members, Mattis, joined Theranos in 2013 immediately after retiring from a long career of military service that concluded with a stint leading CENTCOM, the US combatant command that is responsible for, among other things, Afghanistan. \n\nMattis (who, obviously, has no expertise in medical testing) pushed for the military to use Theranos technology, but it was never actually used because it didn\u2019t work. \n\nNonetheless, as of December 2015, Mattis was still vouching for the company, telling the Washington Post that he \u201chad quickly seen tremendous potential in the technologies Theranos develops, and I have the greatest respect for the company\u2019s mission and integrity.\u201d \n\nThe technology, it is now clear, had no potential and the company had no integrity. \n\nNobody has properly questioned Mattis about this\nThe SEC charges are new. \n\nBut by the time Mattis was selected to serve as Trump\u2019s Secretary of Defense in January 2017, the basic scope of the fraud was already well-known to the public thanks to diligent journalistic work. So was the fact that Mattis was not only earning $150,000 a year for his service on the Theranos board but also that he was involved in pro-Theranos advocacy while serving on active duty. \n\nHe duly resigned from Theranos on January 5, 2017 \u2014 by which time the company was already commonly described as \u201cembroiled in scandal\u201d by press reports \u2014 but, remarkably, the whole affair didn\u2019t come up at his confirmation hearings. \n\nIt\u2019s not exactly rare for members of a corporate board of directors to be window-dressing with no actual involvement in or knowledge of a company\u2019s operations, so the mere fact that the whole company was a giant scam doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect any action on Mattis\u2019s part. That said, at least in theory, directors are supposed to do something, and serving as window-dressing for a massive fraud is the kind of thing that normally reflects poorly on a person\u2019s reputation. \n\nWhat\u2019s more, as Paul Szoldra writes at Task and Purpose, pre-retirement Mattis genuinely seems to have been actively involved in trying to help Theranos bypass the regulatory process:\n\n\n\u201cI would very much appreciate your help in getting this information corrected with the regulatory agencies,\u201d Holmes wrote in an email to Mattis, also obtained by the Post. \u201cSince this misinformation came from within DoD, it will be invaluable if this information is formally corrected by the right people in DoD.\u201d\n\nThe general then forwarded the email chain on and asked, \u201chow do we overcome this new obstacle?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have tried to get this device tested in theater asap, legally and ethically,\u201d Mattis wrote. \u201cThis appears to be relatively straight-forward yet we\u2019re a year into this and not yet deployed.\u201d\n\n\nYet even with the SEC now throwing the book at the company, nobody in Congress is interested in asking Mattis what, exactly, he knew about Theranos and when. And the worst thing about it is their inclination to treat him with kid gloves makes a lot of sense. \n\nNobody wants us all to get killed \nA longtime concern many people have had about Donald Trump is that while the Silvio Berlusconi era in Italy was mostly funny, putting a temperamental and ignorant man in charge of the mightiest empire the world has ever known risks leading to the deaths of millions of people. \n\nAs Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) put it during the campaign, it would be unwise to give \u201cthe nuclear codes of the United States to an erratic individual.\u201d Rubio eventually endorsed Trump for president, though he pointedly declined to retract that claim. \n\nNothing Trump has actually done since taking office \u2014 from provoking a small diplomatic crisis with Australia to accidentally (?) leaking classified Israeli intelligence to the Russian foreign minister to firing his secretary of State on Twitter \u2014 has served to debunk the notion that his decision-making process is impulsive and unsound.  \n\n\n\n\"A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.\" \u2014Hillary\n\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) July 29, 2016\n\n\n\n\nIn this context, Mattis is near-universally viewed as an island of stability. Respected by the right for having been fired by President Barack Obama, he is also well-informed and (despite the nickname \u201cMad Dog\u201d) level-headed. Like most career military officers, he is less cavalier about the risks of war than many civilian hawks and, generally speaking, almost everyone in Washington sleeps better knowing that he is running the Defense Department. \n\nThe Theranos thing is a bad look, but there are plenty of Trump Cabinet corruption scandals to talk about \u2014 the Ben Carson one is funniest \u2014 so it\u2019s not like Democrats are lacking for general partisan ammunition. If Mattis comes under pressure he might quit or get fired and who knows who Trump might tap to replace him. \n\nUnder the circumstances, a softball approach to Mattis seems warranted no matter how rotten the signal that sends to the rest of the military, the business community, and the public about the wisdom of getting mixed-up in fraudulent endeavors.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Ezra Klein", "body": "\u201cWhen the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s John Brennan, the former CIA director, slamming Donald Trump after his attorney general fired former FBI Director Andrew McCabe. Those are not normal comments from a former CIA director. But then, these are not normal times.  \n\nMcCabe\u2019s firing shows how Trump has corroded the operations of the American government. There are real questions about McCabe\u2019s performance at the FBI. But there are even deeper questions about Trump\u2019s public vendetta against McCabe, and the role Sessions played in his termination.\n\nMcCabe is not innocent of wrongdoing. He made a questionable call (at best) about allowing a leak to the press during the 2016 campaign and then he appears to have lied about it, though he says it was an honest mistake. You can imagine a normal administration, and a normal process, weighing McCabe\u2019s actions carefully and seriously.\n\nBut none of this is why Trump wanted McCabe gone, and \u201ccarefully and seriously\u201d is not how the process was conducted. Trump wanted McCabe gone because of McCabe\u2019s involvement in the Justice Department investigation of Russian meddling in the campaign. Trump thinks McCabe is a Comey-aligned Democrat who was biased against him. Trump believes his political appointees should protect him. Trump has been explicit in public about all of this. And he has spent months publicly slandering McCabe and pressuring Sessions to fire him. \n\nTrump\u2019s campaign had already worked. McCabe announced his retirement.  The Trump administration fired him on Friday not to remove him from government, but to deny him the pension earned for over 20 years of government service. It was an act of punishment, not of personnel management.\n\nThis, then, is part of the cost of Trump\u2019s daily venality: even when his administration makes a decision that might be justifiable on its own terms, the process by which that decision was made cannot be trusted, and may indeed be a scandal in its own right. \n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who serves on the Judiciary Committee, called the McCabe firing \u201cadded evidence of obstruction of justice.\u201d \n\nShould Andrew McCabe have been fired? \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Federal Bureau of Investigation Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, pictured in December.\n      \n      \n        Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nIt\u2019s worth beginning with what McCabe is said to have done wrong. As my colleagues explain:\n\n\nJustice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz found that, in 2016, McCabe inappropriately allowed two top officials to speak to reporters about his decision to open a case into the Clinton Foundation. That incident was under investigation as part of a broader look into how the FBI and Justice Department handled themselves during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBut McCabe apparently lied about his authorization during an interview with the months-long probe. That led the FBI to recommend firing McCabe \u2014 a recommendation Sessions just accepted.\n\n\u201cThe FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability. As the OPR proposal stated, \u2018all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand,\u2019 Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement provided by the Justice Department.\n\n\nMcCabe disputes this interpretation. In his searing statement upon being fired, he wrote:\n\nThe OIG investigation has focused on information I chose to share with a reporter through my public affairs officer and a legal counselor. As Deputy Director, I was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a secret, it took place over several days, and others, including the Director, were aware of the interaction with the reporter. It was the same type of exchange with the media that the Deputy Director oversees several times per week. In fact it was the same type of work that I continued to do under Director Wray, at his request. The investigation subsequently focused on who I talked to, when I talked to them, and so forth. During these inquiries, I answered questions truthfully and as accurately as I could amidst the chaos that surrounded me. And when I thought my answers were misunderstood, I contacted investigators to correct them.\n\nSessions\u2019 explanation of the firing boils down to this line:  \u201cIntegrity is our brand.\u201d The Department of Justice cannot afford even the perception of malfeasance or improper behavior. \n\nBut this is coming from an attorney general who appears to be crossing ethical lines himself in making this decision. Sessions recused himself, in no uncertain terms, from any questions related to the investigations into the Clinton campaign or Russia\u2019s involvement in the 2016 election:\n\n\nMr. Chairman, it was a highly contentious campaign. I, like a lot of people, made comments about the issues in that campaign. With regard to Secretary Clinton and some of the comments I made, I do believe that that could place me objectivity in question. I\u2019ve given that thought.\n\nI believe the proper thing for me to do, would be to recuse myself from any questions involving those kind of investigations that involve Secretary Clinton and that were raised during the campaign or to be otherwise connected to it.\n\n\nBut now Sessions is firing McCabe for activities undeniably related to the Clinton investigation, and after public pressure from Trump, who is explicitly angry at McCabe for activities relating to the Russia investigation, which Sessions is also recused from.\n\nIndeed, Trump has carried out this vendetta with McCabe for months, and done so in public, in harshly personal terms:\n\n\n\nFBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!\n\u2014 Donald J.

Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation but got....\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017\n\n\n\n\nIt is difficult to believe that the full weight of the presidency was focused on firing McCabe for improperly authorizing FBI officials to speak to the Wall Street Journal or even hiding it later. Indeed, few believe that. \n\nThe force of the White House was brought down on McCabe because of McCabe\u2019s role overseeing the Russia probe, and because of McCabe\u2019s ties to James Comey, who Trump loathes. Indeed, Trump hasn\u2019t even sought to hide that fact:\n\n\n\nAndrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 17, 2018\n\n\n\n\nSessions has his own personal and professional reasons to get rid of McCabe. Sessions angered Trump when he stepped back from the investigations, leaving Trump exposed to inquiries from Robert Mueller. Trump has publicly mocked Sessions for months in what is clearly a pressure campaign to get Sessions to resign. \n\nNow Sessions is making a decision that not only conflicts with his promise to recuse, but is exactly what his boss want from him \u2014 an olive branch to a man who might fire him, and that comes at a time when Trump is known to be looking for administration appointees to fire. Whatever damage McCabe did to the FBI\u2019s brand is nothing compared to the damage Sessions is doing to the Department of Justice\u2019s brand. Who could possibly look at this episode and believe Sessions acted independent of Trump\u2019s pressure? \n\nMcCabe acted improperly enough that it is possible to justify his termination. But Trump and Sessions have acted improperly enough that it is hard to trust the process that led to McCabe\u2019s termination, or to believe that this is anything but what it looks like: an effort to punish and humiliate a perceived political enemy, and to send a message to others who might investigate Trump that they do so at their peril. \n\nThis is the problem with a White House occupied by a vengeful chief executive who has little respect for institutional independence, rule of law, or government transparency. Trump cannot be trusted to carry out decisions like this one fairly or impartially, and so the decisions themselves cannot be trusted.

According to Austin\u2019s police chief, more than 500 federal agents are working on the case as police try frantically to track down any leads to the bomber.\n\nThese are the moments when a president typically has to act as a head of state \u2014 to acknowledge the pain and fear Americans are feeling, and to reassure them that their government is doing all it can to keep them safe. But this is President Trump, and he has often been oddly silent at times when other presidents would have offered soothing words.\n\nIn the case of Austin, the president\u2019s silence \u2014 during a time when he\u2019s been so outspoken about so many things \u2014 suggests either ignorance or callousness. Either he is unaware that an American city is being terrorized, or he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s as important as Sean Hannity\u2019s appearances on Fox  Friends. Neither is acceptable.\n\nTrump has already missed his chance to speak out without raising awkward questions about whose lives matter\nThe first three explosions \u2014 which killed 39-year-old Anthony House and 17-year-old Draylen Mason, as well as injuring two women \u2014 were package bombs, leading the Austin Police Department to caution residents not to open or touch any suspicious packages. When the second and third bombs exploded on March 12, investigators began to put together a pattern that suggested that the bombings were related: House\u2019s and Mason\u2019s families knew each other through black community activism. (The third bomb injured a Latina woman in east Austin, though it\u2019s not clear whether it was intended for her.)\n\nThe president tweeted about a \u201cheartbreaking\u201d bridge collapse at Florida International University. He sent condolences to the families of two naval aviators. He fired his secretary of state over Twitter and spent the end of the week hinting ominously to the press that more firings were on the horizon. He warned about the hypothetical threat to the safety of Americans posed by \u201cdangerous criminal aliens,\u201d \u201cset free to prey on innocent Americans.\u201d\n\nBut he didn\u2019t say anything about the actual threat to the safety of innocent Americans posed by Austin\u2019s package bombs.\n\nA president who cared more about trying to reassure all Americans that he was their president regardless of whether they voted for him in 2016 \u2014 or who felt any lingering shame over his response to violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in September 2017, when his insistence on blaming \u201cboth sides\u201d struck many as a defense of neo-Nazis \u2014 might have been particularly quick to condemn attacks that were killing black Americans involved in racial justice. \n\nBut the president \u2014 who, by all reports, is more self-confident and self-reliant than ever, and increasingly convinced that he understands the presidency better than his advisers \u2014 felt no need to do any of that.\n\nThe fourth explosion, which happened Sunday night and injured two cyclists, was similar enough to the previous bombs for investigators to believe the bombings were related, but was triggered by a \u201ctripwire\u201d \u2014 a much more sophisticated form of bomb, and one much harder to avoid. \n\nResidents of the Austin neighborhood where Sunday night\u2019s bomb went off were told not to leave their houses Monday morning so that law enforcement could sweep the area. School buses didn\u2019t go in, and absences were excused.\n\nThe president tweeted about \u201cwitch hunts\u201d instead.\n\nBecause both the cyclists were white and the bomb was in a southwestern Austin neighborhood (which, unlike the east Austin neighborhoods to which the package bombs were addressed, isn\u2019t predominantly black), the latest bombing might complicate the picture of the bomber\u2019s motivations \u2014 though police stress that they\u2019re not ruling out any potential motive right now.\n\nHonestly, that means the window for Trump to say something about Austin without awkward follow-up questions may have already closed. If he speaks out now, he runs the risk of making it look like he only cares now that white people are being harmed. But with each day he remains silent, it begins to look, more and more, like he\u2019s waiting for more information before he decides whether to condemn bombings killing Americans on American soil.\n\nThe residents of Austin deserve to be just as safe and secure as anyone else in the country. If the president really believes that, it\u2019s hard to understand what is keeping him from saying it, or tweeting it.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Andrew Prokop", "body": "Former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe is speaking out. One week after being fired by Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department the day before he was set to retire, McCabe has written an op-ed in the Washington Post with the eye-catching headline: \u201cNot in my worst nightmares did I dream my FBI career would end this way.\u201d\n\nMcCabe\u2019s piece focuses mostly on how he got the news of his firing (he says he saw it on TV before seeing an email in his work account), President Trump\u2019s personal attacks on him (which he calls \u201churtful and false\u201d), and why he joined the FBI in the first place (\u201ca desire to do good\u201d).\n\nAnd this comes amid a PR effort from McCabe and his allies to portray his firing as corrupt. Earlier this week, anonymous sources told ABC News that, early in 2017, McCabe had authorized a criminal probe of Attorney General Jeff Sessions regarding his statements about his contacts with Russian officials during his confirmation hearing. Though the investigation was soon taken over by Robert Mueller, the implication was that McCabe\u2019s firing (ordered by Sessions himself), was hypocritical if not downright retaliatory.\n\nBut we\u2019re still missing a very important part of this story: what, exactly, did McCabe say to the Justice Department\u2019s Inspector General that got him in so much trouble?\n\nThe Department of Justice says McCabe was fired at the recommendation of DOJ\u2019s inspector general, Michael Horowitz \u2014 an Obama appointee who serves as an internal watchdog within the agency. Horowitz has been investigating leaks from the Justice Department and FBI during the 2016 campaign. His investigation started shortly before Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nAnd while Horowitz\u2019s final report has not yet been released, Sessions\u2019s office says the inspector general recommended McCabe\u2019s firing because McCabe \u201cmade an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor \u2014 including under oath \u2014 on multiple occasions.\u201d \n\nMcCabe\u2019s op-ed is vague and unconvincing on what exactly happened here, dealing with it in just a single paragraph that claims that \u201cbecause of what was going on around\u201d him, he \u201cmay well have been confused and distracted\u201d when answering the inspector general\u2019s questions, and given answers that were \u201cnot fully accurate.\u201d\n\nBut this is no minor matter. It\u2019s crucial in determining what to make of McCabe\u2019s dismissal. It\u2019s entirely possible that, despite Trump\u2019s treatment of McCabe being indeed incredibly unprofessional and worrying, McCabe\u2019s statements to the IG really were egregious. \u201cLacking candor\u201d to an inspector general, \u201cincluding under oath, on multiple occasions\u201d is quite bad and probably firing-worthy, if that is indeed what happened. \n\nAnd what we already know McCabe did is questionable enough itself.\n\nMcCabe leaked information about the FBI\u2019s Clinton Foundation investigation to a reporter just days before the 2016 election\nOn October 24, 2016, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Devlin Barrett published a story that got an enormous amount of attention on the right. The story revealed that McCabe\u2019s wife had run for Virginia state senate in 2015, and that Virginia\u2019s Democratic governor, the longtime Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe, raised funds for her campaign. Barrett also pointed out that McCabe had a role overseeing the Clinton email investigation. (Trump would later cite this information repeatedly, both in public and private, as showing McCabe\u2019s supposed corruption.)\n\nLess than a week later, on October 30, Barrett published another Journal story. His sources describe, in some detail, interactions McCabe was said to have had with Obama Justice Department officials about an investigation of the Clinton Foundation. It portrays McCabe as heroically trying to keep this investigation moving forward, over an unnamed Justice Department official\u2019s resistance.\n\nThe October 30 article was based on leaks  \u2014 leaks that described internal deliberations about an ongoing investigation tied to a major party presidential nominee, and coming just days before the presidential election. And these leaks were clearly designed to rehabilitate damage to McCabe and the FBI\u2019s reputation. They are a key focus of the inspector general\u2019s investigation. \n\nAnd they were, in fact, leaks initiated by McCabe \u2014 in a statement McCabe released the night of his firing, he admitted as much. He claimed the leaks were authorized \u201cunder FBI rules,\u201d and tried to portray his actions in a sympathetic light. He wrote:\n\n\nI was being portrayed in the media over and over as a political partisan, accused of closing down investigations under political pressure. The FBI was portrayed as caving under that pressure, and making decisions for political rather than law enforcement purposes. Nothing was further from the truth. In fact, this entire investigation stems from my efforts, fully authorized under FBI rules, to set the record straight on behalf of the Bureau and to make it clear that we were continuing an investigation that people in DOJ opposed.\n\nThe OIG investigation has focused on information I chose to share with a reporter through my public affairs officer and a legal counselor. As Deputy Director, I was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a secret, it took place over several days, and others, including the Director, were aware of the interaction with the reporter. It was the same type of exchange with the media that the Deputy Director oversees several times per week.\n\n\nThe less sympathetic interpretation would be that McCabe chose to leak his version of internal deliberations about an ongoing investigation tied to the Democratic presidential nominee to try and make himself and/or the FBI look better at the expense of Obama\u2019s Justice Department, because he was annoyed at an earlier story that made him look bad. And \u2014 again \u2014 that he chose to do this just days before the presidential election.\n\nThe Justice Department claims McCabe didn\u2019t fess up about his role in these leaks\nOn January 12, 2017 \u2014 a little over a week before Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2014 Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz announced that he\u2019d open a review of \u201callegations regarding certain actions\u201d by the Justice Department and FBI \u201cin advance of the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nThe review was broad. It included then-FBI director James Comey\u2019s decisions to speak publicly about the Clinton email case, allegations that McCabe should have recused himself from Clinton investigations, and, more vaguely, \u201callegations that Department and FBI employees improperly disclosed non-public information,\u201d among other matters.\n\nWe are still awaiting Horowitz\u2019s final report. But we know that he or his investigators interviewed McCabe about that Wall Street Journal leak. And Horowitz is said to have concluded McCabe\u2019s answers were firing-worthy.\n\n\u201cThe investigation subsequently focused on who I talked to, when I talked to them, and so forth,\u201d McCabe said in his statement last week. \u201cDuring these inquiries, I answered questions truthfully and as accurately as I could amidst the chaos that surrounded me. And when I thought my answers were misunderstood, I contacted investigators to correct them.\u201d\n\nIn his new Post op-ed, he continues in this vein:\n\nI have been accused of \u201clack of candor.\u201d That is not true. I did not knowingly mislead or lie to investigators. When asked about contacts with a reporter that were fully within my power to authorize as deputy director, and amid the chaos that surrounded me, I answered questions as completely and accurately as I could. And when I realized that some of my answers were not fully accurate or may have been misunderstood, I took the initiative to correct them. At worst, I was not clear in my responses, and because of what was going on around me may well have been confused and distracted \u2014 and for that I take full responsibility. But that is not a lack of candor. \n\nTo be blunt: many now defending McCabe would roundly mock a Trump ally citing a similar excuse for making misstatements to investigators. He gave \u201cnot fully accurate\u201d answers because he was \u201cconfused\u201d and \u201cdistracted\u201d because of \u201cwhat was going on around\u201d him? \n\nIn any case, the competing claims are essentially as follows. The Justice Department says the IG found McCabe lacked candor on multiple occasions, including under oath, and that this was serious enough to merit his firing. McCabe says he unintentionally gave \u201cnot fully accurate\u201d answers to the IG, but that he didn\u2019t mean to and later tried to correct the record. \n\nNeither of these competing claims gets into specifics about what McCabe said and why, exactly, it wasn\u2019t accurate. The Inspector General\u2019s report will. And it could complicate the narrative among Trump\u2019s critics that McCabe was corruptly pushed out.\n\nIt is certainly true that, as Ezra Klein and others write, Trump wanted McCabe gone for reasons having nothing to do with the IG\u2019s investigation, and that members of Congress were also calling for McCabe\u2019s head for largely political reasons. Still, this IG investigation was initiated by an Obama appointee, before Trump\u2019s inauguration. And IGs traditionally proceed with a good amount of independence \u2014 they are the internal watchdogs charged with keeping departments honest. \n\nIf Horowitz truly did recommend McCabe\u2019s firing as a result of some damning findings, Sessions was probably justified in carrying out that recommendation. Alternatively, it\u2019s of course possible that Horowitz could have overreached. But it seems we\u2019ll have to wait for his report to get some specifics of what actually happened when McCabe spoke to the IG.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "German Lopez", "body": "Gun control is, broadly speaking, incredibly popular in America. Polling for many common gun control measures, including universal background checks, can top 75 percent \u2014 even among Republicans.\n\nSo why can\u2019t it get through Congress?\n\nThe best explanation seems to be issue intensity. Essentially, lots of Americans support gun control, but it\u2019s not really their top priority when they go out to vote. Meanwhile, those who oppose stricter gun laws are simply more likely to make it the one issue they\u2019ll vote on.\n\nThis was articulated by Republican strategist Grover Norquist back in 2000. He said, \u201cThe question is intensity versus preference. You can always get a certain percentage to say they are in favor of some gun controls. But are they going to vote on their \u2018control\u2019 position?\u201d Probably not, he suggested, \u201cbut for that 4-5 percent who care about guns, they will vote on this.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what makes movements like the March for Our Lives \u2014 and much of the activism that\u2019s followed the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, which killed 17 \u2014 so important. For once, we are seeing a mass movement that is extremely dedicated to gun control. It seems to be an issue that the movement\u2019s leaders are ready to go all-in on. And by attracting so much national attention, the movement may inspire other Americans to follow suit \u2014 making gun control an issue that can actually sway votes. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say the March for Our Lives and related movements will ultimately succeed \u2014 it\u2019s just too soon to tell. But as thousands of protesters take to the streets in Washington, DC, and the rest of the country on Saturday, the movement\u2019s apparent potential to promote and boost issue intensity on gun control could ultimately make it pivotal.\n\nSome gun control measures are extremely popular, even among Republicans\nCongress\u2019s inaction on guns over the past few years is not due to the unpopularity of gun control measures. If you look at the polling, support for gun control, depending on which specific measure respondents are asked about, can be very high among both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nHere, for example, are the results of surveys by the Pew Research Center, which found strong support for measures ranging from an assault weapons ban to universal background checks to restrictions on people with mental illness buying guns:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nWhat\u2019s remarkable about the polling is how much of it reflects bipartisan support for new gun control measures. A majority of Republicans back universal background checks, a ban on assault-style weapons, a federal database to track gun sales, prohibitions on people with mental illness, and barring people on no-fly or watch lists from buying firearms. In fact, GOP support for three of these policies tops 75 percent.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Republicans agree with all gun control measures. And a majority back measures that gun control proponents oppose, including allowing concealed carry in more places, shortening waiting periods for buying guns legally, and arming teachers. \n\nBut there\u2019s a lot of remarkable middle ground \u2014 one that you wouldn\u2019t know of if you just looked at Congress\u2019s record passing new restrictions on firearms.\n\nIssue intensity is the key\nThis is where issue intensity comes in. Consider this chart, also from Pew:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nAbout 21 percent of gun owners have contacted a public official to express an opinion on gun policy, compared to just 12 percent of non-gun owners. And about 22 percent of people who want less strict gun laws have contacted a public official, while just 15 percent of people who support stricter laws have.\n\nThe differences are more pronounced if you look at contact in the previous 12 months. Gun owners are 80 percent more likely than non-gun owners to have contacted a public official about gun policy in the past year. And supporters of laxer gun laws are nearly 60 percent more likely than supporters of stricter gun laws to have contacted a public official over the issue in the same time span.\n\nThis difference in issue intensity also shows up in other areas. Take this second chart:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nAgain, the situation is skewed in favor of gun owners. About 28 percent of gun owners have contributed to an organization that takes a position on gun policy, while only 10 percent of non-gun owners have. That helps explain how a group like the National Rifle Association (NRA) has become so powerful, while there are no political equivalents \u2014 in terms of influence \u2014 on the other side.\n\nOne caveat to the charts: Based on Pew\u2019s surveys, there are way more adults in the US who believe that gun laws should be stricter (52 percent) than those who believe gun laws should be less strict (18 percent). So the side in favor of stricter gun laws can afford to have a lower percentage of its people contacting public officials.\n\nIt\u2019s demonstrative, though, to focus on the 12-month data for this. As it shows, gun owners and supporters of laxer gun laws are more likely to have recently engaged a public official or political organization on this issue. That matters: If a senator gets phone calls every few months from gun owners and opponents of stricter laws, that\u2019s going to make a bigger impression than calls from non-gun owners and supporters of stricter laws every year or so.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true if you consider political party. Republicans are much more likely to oppose stricter laws, based on Pew\u2019s data. So if a Republican senator mostly hears from GOP constituents, and these constituents are more likely to be really passionate about the issue since they are on the side that opposes stricter laws, that\u2019s going to give the senator a skewed perception of where voters are on this topic. As a result, Republican lawmakers are more resistant to calls for gun control \u2014 arguing against \u201cpoliticizing\u201d mass shootings and focusing on issues like mental health instead.\n\nSo why the difference in passion? Kristin Goss, a political scientist at Duke University and author of The Gun Debate: What Everyone Needs to Know, previously told me that it\u2019s a sense of tangible loss. Gun owners feel like the government is going to take their guns and rights. \n\nThis sentiment has been fueled by a decades-long public campaign by the NRA to convince the US public and politicians that, in fact, the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms, and that more guns will actually make people safer (by letting them protect themselves), despite research that shows higher levels of gun ownership actually lead to more gun violence.\n\nGun control advocates, meanwhile, are motivated by more abstract notions of reducing gun violence \u2014 although, Goss noted, the victims of mass shootings and their families have begun putting a face on these policies. \n\nThat\u2019s exactly what the current protests are doing, with student survivors from Florida in particular actively participating and showing the human, personal cost of unabated gun violence in a very public manner. Success isn\u2019t guaranteed. But the potential to inspire more widespread and passionate empathy and sympathy through these demonstrations could crack the key problem facing the gun control movement today.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Alex Ward", "body": "Gina Haspel \u2014 a CIA operative who oversaw the torture of two terrorism suspects at a secret prison in Thailand and then helped destroy tapes of the interrogations \u2014 will likely be the next CIA director.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced a major shakeup in his national security team: Rex Tillerson is out as secretary of state, CIA Director Mike Pompeo heads over to lead the State Department, and Haspel \u2014 the CIA\u2019s deputy director \u2014 will replace Pompeo as the head of the intelligence agency.\n\nIf confirmed, Haspel would be the first woman to lead the CIA. She\u2019s widely respected in intelligence circles and has spent over 30 years in the CIA, where she was undercover for most of that time. But she remains a controversial figure for her years-long involvement in a wider CIA program that led to the torture of dozens of suspects, which included stuffing people into coffins or depriving them of sleep.\n\nDespite this, Trump clearly has confidence in Haspel, and she says she\u2019s ready for her new role. \u201cI am grateful to President Trump for the opportunity, and humbled by his confidence in me, to be nominated to be the next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency,\u201d Haspel said in a statement after the president\u2019s announcement.\n\nWhatever reservations Trump may have had about torture, he\u2019s set them aside to promote Haspel to lead one of America\u2019s most famous agencies.\n\nHaspel\u2019s long history with torture\nHaspel ran the CIA\u2019s detention site in Thailand, the agency\u2019s first overseas secret prison.\n\nIt was there, in 2002, that she oversaw the interrogation of two terrorism suspects. One was Abu Zubaydah, who according to the New Yorker \u201cwas tortured so brutally that at one point he appeared to be dead.\u201d CIA operatives reportedly waterboarded Zubaydah 83 times and repeatedly slammed him into walls. \n\nThe other, Abd al Rahim al-Nashiri, was also waterboarded in 2002 and is currently being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nThe CIA also videotaped the torture. The 92 tapes were held in a safe until the agency asked for their destruction in 2005. Haspel, who then worked out of Langley overseeing the CIA\u2019s torture program, had her name on the cable that ordered their eradication. However, the CIA said at the time that Haspel\u2019s boss, Jose Rodriguez, made the call. The Justice Department investigated the tape-destruction order but ultimately filed no charges.\n\nPresident Barack Obama ordered the closure of CIA black sites in 2009, but it\u2019s unclear if Haspel\u2019s nomination means they\u2019ll make a comeback. Trump previously advocated for the return of torture against terrorism suspects until Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis convinced the president otherwise.\n\nHaspel \u2014 who may get a lot of face time with the president delivering his daily intelligence briefing \u2014 may have the chance to change Trump\u2019s mind on this controversial issue.\n\nHaspel has her detractors\nWhen Pompeo announced Haspel as his deputy in February 2017, civil rights advocates widely criticized her appointment. \n\n\u201cPompeo must explain to the American people how his promotion of someone allegedly involved in running a torture site squares with his own sworn promises to Congress that he will reject all forms of torture and abuse,\u201d Christopher Anders of the American Civil Liberties Union told CBS News last year.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and other Senate Democrats protested her appointment to the CIA\u2019s No. 2 job last year. And Sen.

This is how Washington has come to calm itself over these past 24 months. Yes, what the president of the United States just said might be alarming, but the president says lots of alarming things, and he rarely follows through. \n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s management style is such that he likes to say what\u2019s on his mind,\u201d Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) told Vox. \u201cHe grows anxious when he has an unexpressed thought. It\u2019s not a criticism; it\u2019s just the way he is. He likes to say, \u2018Here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.\u2019 But you have to judge him by what he does.\u201d\n\nBetween what Trump says and what he does is his staff. The executive bureaucracy is a sprawling machine that takes time to understand and effort to work. Trump has not committed himself to the task of mastery, or even of comprehension. This has been a relief to his allies, who take comfort in their many opportunities to let his impulses dissipate before they become calamities. Trump is also famously responsive to the last person he spoke to, a reflection of his loose grasp of the issues he faces. He knows what he feels better than he knows what he wants. \n\nFor these reasons, though, the news that truly matters in Trumpland is staffing, and there, the news is grim. The replacement of H.R. McMaster with former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton takes a reckless, confrontational president and ensconces him in an informational architecture that will now be erected by a reckless, confrontational national security adviser. \n\n\u201cThis is by far the most important national security position in our government,\u201d writes Kelly Magsamen, vice president for national security and international policy at the liberal Center for American Progress. \u201cWhy? Because this person is the one in charge of shaping and framing national security decisions for the President.\u201d\n\nNor is it just McMaster leaving the administration and being replaced by a more Trumpist figure. Recent weeks have seen the exits of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn. Both men were replaced by more extreme candidates. \n\nTrump also fired his lawyer John Dowd on Thursday, a move that the New Yorker\u2019s legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin believes \u201csubstantially increases the chances that the President will move to fire [special counsel Robert] Mueller \u2014 perhaps very soon.\u201d \n\nHope Hicks is likely to be replaced as communications director by Kellyanne Conway, whose famous coining of the term \u201calternative facts\u201d speaks to how little emphasis she places on ensuring the information that gets to the president or out from the White House is rigorously checked and accurately sourced. \n\nChief of Staff John Kelly\u2019s job is imperiled too. Trump is tired of Kelly\u2019s gatekeeping and attempts to keep order, so he\u2019s musing about firing Kelly and managing the White House himself. \n\nAll this is likely to lead to a cycle of immoderation ripping through the White House staff. As the ranks of the moderates thin, the jobs of the remaining moderates become more grueling and hopeless. Already, Bolton is spoiling for a fight with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who is widely seen as a key moderating force on Trump. \u201cSources who know Bolton expect he will stare down Mattis, tell him when he\u2019s wrong, and will be a Henry Kissinger-type presence in the room,\u201d reports Mike Allen. \u201cNow that Tillerson is gone, he could fundamentally tip the balance of power on Trump\u2019s national security team, senior officials expect.\u201d \n\nWorking in the Trump administration is difficult in the best of circumstances, and Mattis has been doing it since day one. But the ranks of his allies are waning, and Trump is evidently chafing under the restraints of his staff. How long will Mattis want to continue in his role? How long will he be allowed to continue in his role?\n\nBut as Trump surrounds himself with staff who amplify his tendency toward confrontation and escalation, the likelihood that Trump\u2019s instincts will become his policies grows. And that means it\u2019s entirely possible that 12 months from now, America will be embroiled in a trade war with China and Europe, in military conflict with North Korea, and managing the aftermath of Mueller\u2019s termination. \n\nIf year one of the Trump era was marked by the relief that so few of the president\u2019s opinions became official policy, year two may be defined by the catastrophes that follow a reckless leader unleashing his impulses upon the world. \n\nFurther reading:\n\u2022 Vox\u2019s John Bolton explainer. Here\u2019s the key graf: \u201cBolton has said the United States should declare war on both North Korea and Iran. He was credibly accused of manipulating US intelligence on weapons of mass destruction prior to the Iraq War and of abusive treatment of his subordinates. He once \u2018joked\u2019 about knocking 10 stories off the UN building in New York. That means his new appointment to be the most important national security official in the White House has significant \u2014 and frightening \u2014 implications for Trump\u2019s approach to the world.\u201d \n\n\u2022 The New York Times adds: \u201cMr. Bolton will almost surely encourage Mr. Trump\u2019s instincts against diplomatic agreements both consider weak and unwise. He shares the president\u2019s derisive opinion of the Iran nuclear deal and will presumably prod him to scrap it when a May deadline arrives. He likewise takes a dim view of international agreements like the Paris climate change accord, from which Mr. Trump announced last year that he would withdraw the United States. He has called the \u2018two-state solution\u2019 for Israel and the Palestinians dead.\u201d\n\n\u2022 At the American Conservative, Gareth Porter dives into Bolton\u2019s machinations toward Iran: \u201cBolton\u2019s high-profile advocacy of war with Iran is well known. What is not at all well known is that, when he was under secretary of state for arms control and international security, he executed a complex and devious strategy aimed at creating the justification for a U.S. attack on Iran.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The (not-that-)wayback machine: Remember when Donald Trump thought George W. Bush\u2019s hawkish advisers had discredited themselves after the disaster of the Iraq War? Trump\u2019s Twitter account does. \n\n\u2022 This is concerning context, particularly given what we know of Trump\u2019s personality: \u201cAs the economist Daniel Kahneman and the political scientist Jonathan Renshon have written, \u2018a bias in favor of hawkish beliefs and preferences is built into the fabric of the human mind.\u2019 The arguments of hawkish advisers often play into policymakers\u2019 psychological biases and shortcuts \u2014 such as over-optimism about potential conflicts, or the aversion to cutting losses. As a result, in debates about war, decision-makers are more likely to listen to hawks than doves.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Max Boot: \u201cMost presidents initially stock their administrations with cronies and ideological purists. Then, after suffering inevitable setbacks, they usher them out in favor of less ideological and more competent professionals. President Trump is doing it in reverse. He is jettisoning anyone who could serve as a break on his extremist tendencies, and replacing them with fire-breathing TV personalities.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Alex Ward", "body": "The Trump administration has spent months attacking former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe. Now, McCabe has been fired 26 hours before his formal retirement \u2014 a move that could cost him his federal pension.\n\nOn Friday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced  McCabe\u2019s ouster from the FBI. McCabe had planned to leave for good on March 18 after a storied 21-year career, but Sessions decided to push him out the door early.\n\nHere\u2019s why: Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz found that, in 2016, McCabe inappropriately allowed two top officials to speak to reporters about his decision to open a case into the Clinton Foundation. That incident was was under investigation as part of a broader look into how the FBI and Justice Department handled themselves during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBut McCabe apparently lied about his authorization during an interview with the months-long probe. That led the FBI to recommend firing McCabe \u2014 a recommendation Sessions just accepted. \n\n\u201cThe FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability.  As the OPR proposal stated, \u2018all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand,\u2019 Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement provided by the Justice Department.\n\n\u201cPursuant to Department Order 1202, and based on the report of the Inspector General, the findings of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility, and the recommendation of the Department\u2019s senior career official, I have terminated the employment of Andrew McCabe effective immediately,\u201d the statement read.\n\nMcCabe had resigned from his post as the deputy director of the FBI after being publicly attacked for months by Trump and other top administration officials. He stepped away from his responsibilities, however, hoping to wait to leave until his retirement date. McCabe will now lose his pension.\n\nIn response to his dismissal, McCabe released a fiery statement. \u201cI am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey,\u201d he said in a statement. \n\n\u201cThis attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally. It is part of this Administration\u2019s ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel investigation, which continue to this day. Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the Special Counsel\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nThe president and his supporters, meanwhile, will surely celebrate. Trump\u2019s fury goes back to a long-running controversy over McCabe\u2019s wife\u2019s allegedly compromising political ties to Hillary Clinton. In 2015, McCabe\u2019s wife ran for a state Senate seat in Virginia, backed in part with money provided by the state Democratic party and a Clinton ally. Trump and other Republicans have used the Justice Department probe against McCabe to argue he was secretly harboring an anti-Trump agenda.\n\nMcCabe\u2019s name also surfaced in a controversial text message sent by FBI agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe over evidence of anti-Trump political bias. \n\nStrzok had mentioned someone named \u201cAndy\u201d in a text message with federal attorney Lisa Page, suggesting there was a discussion about Trump \u2014 and not a positive one \u2014 in McCabe\u2019s office. Page, it turns out, was one of the officials who spoke to the Journal with McCabe\u2019s blessing.\n\nTrump, clearly irked, openly campaigned for Sessions to remove McCabe. \n\n\n\nWhy didn't A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation but got....\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017\n\n\n\n\nOther prominent Republicans outright called for McCabe\u2019s firing too. \u201cHe oughta be replaced. And I\u2019ve said that before and I\u2019ve said it to people who can do it,\u201d Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), the Judiciary Committee chairman, told reporters in December.\n\nThe question now is if McCabe\u2019s firing will strengthen the broader GOP-led movement to discredit federal law enforcement over allegations that it is corruptly anti-Trump. But what\u2019s clear is that the president and his allies hoped McCabe would face a stiff penalty \u2014 and they finally got their wish.\n\nThis could put more pressure on the Trump-Russia probe\nMcCabe\u2019s firing might have a far-reaching impact on Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nWhen Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on May 9, McCabe became acting FBI director. All of a sudden, a man that the president believed worked against him was in charge of (among other things) the probe into the Trump campaign\u2019s connections to Russia.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take too long for Trump to make his anger with this development known. On July 26, 2017, he called on Attorney General Sessions to fire McCabe. This level of presidential involvement in FBI personnel decisions is highly unusual, especially given the lack of concrete evidence of McCabe\u2019s guilt.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t alone in hating the Mueller probe. A growing number of congressional GOP members and right-wing commentators continuously call for Mueller\u2019s dismissal for similar reasons: that is, his perceived bias against Trump. The evidence of such, though, is thin.\n\nThe efforts are part of a broader GOP ploy to paint the Justice Department as hopelessly biased against Trump. The likely aim is to soften the blow of any potential charges against the president or his associates that come out of the Mueller probe.\n\nIn that context, McCabe\u2019s firing sends a chilling message: Draw the president\u2019s ire, especially by investigating him, and you might be publicly humiliated \u2014 and then lose the pension you\u2019ve spent decades accumulating.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matthew Yglesias", "body": "Democrat Linda Belcher was just pronounced the winner of the special election in Kentucky\u2019s House District 49, a seat that Donald Trump carried by a 72-23 margin in 2016 and that went 66-33 for Mitt Romney in 2012. \n\nHer 68-32 victory represents an insane 45-point improvement on Hillary Clinton\u2019s performance. In fuller context, it\u2019s a little less insane than that.

Those numbers have accelerated into 2018. Across 14 races, Democrats are running 28 points ahead of Clinton and 14 points ahead of Obama. \n\nHistorically speaking, special election results usually are somewhat predictive of midterm general election outcomes, though I don\u2019t think anyone believes it\u2019s realistic for Democrats to obtain a nationwide 45-point swing relative to Clinton\u2019s numbers. \n\nMeanwhile, the special elections are already having real-world impact. \n\nWisconsin Gov.

But liberals fear that a recent trend of Trump proving willing to resist advisers who counsel caution will finally lead to him pulling the trigger \u2014 and that he\u2019ll get away with it, since a sycophantic Republican Congress would likely take little action in response.\n\nYet it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that even though Trump has wanted Mueller gone and his investigation shut down for at least nine months \u2014 by one account, Trump actually tried to push Mueller out last June \u2014 he\u2019s been either reticent or unable to actually make it happen so far. And it\u2019s worth understanding the several reasons why that is.\n\nThe process of getting rid of Mueller is much more complicated and legally fraught than, say, firing FBI Director James Comey or Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Furthermore, dismissing Mueller himself wouldn\u2019t end Mueller\u2019s investigation \u2014 an even more controversial intervention would be required for that. Then, even if he pulled it off, Mueller\u2019s firing would likely lead to a flood of leaks. Finally, the ensuing backlash could help Democrats regain control of Congress \u2014 which could make Trump\u2019s legal and political situation even worse.\n\nIt is certainly possible that Trump could change his mind and decide that, despite all this, Mueller\u2019s probe is so dangerous that it\u2019s worth casting caution to the wind and firing him. But he\u2019s been afraid to take that step so far \u2014 and for some very good reasons.\n\n1) Firing Mueller would be much more procedurally complicated and legally challenging than firing Comey or Tillerson\nLast week, President Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with a tweet. Last May, he fired FBI Director James Comey with a signed letter. Both men served at the president\u2019s pleasure \u2014 all the president had to do was say the word, and they were gone.\n\nThings aren\u2019t so simple with Mueller. The special counsel was appointed under a Justice Department regulation that sets restrictions on just how and why he can be fired. \n\nThe how, in this case, is by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (since his boss Jeff Sessions recused himself). Rosenstein appointed Mueller, and according to the regulation, he\u2019s the only person who can fire him.\n\nThen there\u2019s the why, which is also very important here. The regulation states that a special counsel can\u2019t be fired on a whim. Instead, it says, he or she can only be fired for \u201cmisconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause.\u201d \n\nIf Trump truly was hell-bent on dumping Mueller, these problems probably wouldn\u2019t be insurmountable. But the solutions aren\u2019t pretty \u2014 they all involve either more firings or some questionable legal claims.\n\nRegarding the why, the regulation does say a special counsel can be fired for \u201cconflict of interest\u201d \u2014 which may explain some of Trump\u2019s recent tweets:\n\n\n\nA total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 19, 2018\n\n\n\n\nPublicly and privately, Trump and his allies have floated several alleged conflicts that they think could be used to justify ousting Mueller \u2014 ranging from Mueller\u2019s past working relationship with Comey to a years-old Mueller request for a dues refund from Trump National Golf Club. Legal experts don\u2019t seem particularly convinced by these, and Trump\u2019s own White House counsel Don McGahn reportedly refused to order Mueller\u2019s firing based on these pretexts last year. But a hackish enough Trump Justice appointee could cite them as an excuse for the firing.\n\nThe trickier question is the how, considering Rosenstein has repeatedly said he sees no good cause for firing Mueller and has testified that he wouldn\u2019t carry out an order to do so unless he saw good cause. \n\nThere are several ways Trump could get around this, though.\n\n\nTrump could fire Rosenstein and whoever replaces Rosenstein in the Justice Department\u2019s line of succession until he finds someone willing to dismiss Mueller.\nAnother path would be through firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Theoretically, a new attorney general would not be recused from overseeing the Russia investigation like Sessions was, and would replace Rosenstein as Mueller\u2019s boss. However, a permanent attorney general appointee would need to be confirmed by the narrowly divided Senate.\nTrump could also evade both the Justice Department\u2019s line of succession and Senate confirmation by exploiting a little-known law called the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. With it, he could appoint a temporary replacement for Sessions or Rosenstein who\u2019s already been confirmed by the Senate for some other post elsewhere in the government. (Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has been rumored as one possibility.) Whoever this stooge is could then dump Mueller.\nTrump could also rescind the regulation establishing the special counsel\u2019s office altogether \u2014 but revoking a regulation is a lengthy and complex process.\nFinally, he could make a broad executive power claim that he has the power to fire Mueller on his own. But that could lead to a showdown with his own Justice Department (Rosenstein has testified he believes only he can fire Mueller), and would likely end up in court.\n\nAgain \u2014 if Trump wants Mueller gone enough, he can probably make it happen. The point is that getting there would be far uglier and look far more corrupt than even the firing of Comey.\n\n2) Firing Mueller does not mean ending the Mueller investigation\nAll of that lengthy preceding section was just about the complexities of firing Robert S. Mueller III, the person. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t even begin to address another problem Trump would have to solve \u2014 that is, how to end Mueller\u2019s investigation. \n\nCurrently, 17 prosecutors are working under Mueller in the special counsel\u2019s office. They\u2019re working with many FBI agents. They\u2019ve convened at least two grand juries (in Washington, DC, and Alexandria, Virginia). They have live indictments against Paul Manafort (in two jurisdictions) and against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies. Mueller\u2019s team has also banked guilty pleas from five people who have not yet been sentenced. There could even be sealed indictments we don\u2019t know about (George Papadopoulos\u2019s indictment was sealed for months).\n\nFiring Mueller would not make all this vanish. For that, a more proactive cover-up would be necessary. Trump\u2019s hypothetical stooge at the Justice Department would have to not just be willing to dismiss Mueller, but to affirmatively act to shut down (or at least, rein in) his investigation. \n\nAgain, this is something that Trump probably could make happen should he be willing to bear the political consequences. For instance, he could have his Justice Department stooge appoint a crony as a replacement special counsel for Mueller, who will make sure the investigation progresses no further. But it\u2019s yet another step up in difficulty and controversy from just firing one person.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth remembering that President Richard Nixon failed at this stage of the cover-up process. He fired his top Justice Department officials until he found one who\u2019d get rid of the special prosecutor investigating Watergate. But then that Justice official (Robert Bork) appointed a new special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, who ended up investigating the case vigorously.\n\n3) Firing Mueller would unleash the leaks\nIn 10 months of subpoenas, evidence collection, reviews of intelligence intercepts, and witness testimonies, Mueller\u2019s team has gathered an enormous amount of information on the Trump campaign, business, transition, and White House. (For instance, he obtained the full transition team email accounts of 13 Trump aides.)\n\nWe don\u2019t know how much of what they have relates to potential criminality, or how much might just be politically damaging were it to become public. But it sure seems likely that,  should Trump make a corrupt-looking attempt to shut down Mueller\u2019s investigation, lots of this information would find its way to congressional Democrats or to the media.\n\nRecall what happened when Trump fired Comey back in May \u2014 over the ensuing weeks, a remarkable series of bombshell leaks occurred. They were about events both old (Trump\u2019s inappropriate request for Comey\u2019s \u201cloyalty\u201d at a private meeting, his later request that Comey end the investigation into Michael Flynn, and Jared Kushner\u2019s seeking a back channel to communicate with Russia during the transition) and new (Trump\u2019s revelation of classified intelligence to Russian officials in an Oval Office meeting). \n\nMueller\u2019s probe has been remarkably leak-proof so far. Should the probe be shut down in what looks like a corrupt manner, it seems unlikely that would continue. At least some law enforcement officials would likely prove more willing to take the legal risks for leaking, should they feel it\u2019s the only way to prevent a cover-up. And of course, the leaks after Comey\u2019s firing were eventually followed by Mueller\u2019s appointment.\n\n4) A Trump cover-up could improve Democrats\u2019 chances of retaking Congress \u2014 which would worsen the president\u2019s legal woes\nIt\u2019s well understood that Trump would face a political backlash for firing Mueller. In and of itself, that probably wouldn\u2019t be enough to hold him back from doing it \u2014 after all, he\u2019s been willing and even eager to make controversial political moves in the past.\n\nBut the real risk for Trump is in what that political backlash could make likely \u2014 a Democratic takeover of one or both chambers of Congress in 2018.\n\nAlready, the national environment is worrying for Republicans. The president is unpopular. Democrats lead by 9 points in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s average of congressional generic ballot polls. And Democrats have been consistently bettering their 2016 performance in special elections. The enormous controversy that would result from a shutdown of the Mueller investigation could supercharge all this.\n\nThe problem for Trump is not that he\u2019d be sentimental about the GOP\u2019s electoral fate. It\u2019s that Democratic control of even one chamber would unleash empowered opposition party\u2013controlled investigations into him and his administration on Russia, obstruction, and a host of other issues.\n\nThat is to say, firing Mueller could help Democrats retake Congress, and end up landing Trump in far more investigative hot water and political jeopardy.\n\nTrump could well calculate that despite all this, Mueller\u2019s investigation is dangerous enough to himself, his family, or his allies in the near term that it\u2019s worth taking the enormous risk of shutting it down.\n\nBut anyone who thinks firing Mueller would make Trump\u2019s legal problems go away is badly mistaken.

So it seemed odd to some on the right that Trump doing the same was being f\u00eated as a victory for American foreign policy. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not certain why meeting with Kim without preconditions is suddenly a grand coup when we would have gone nuts had Obama done the same,\u201d said conservative pundit Ben Shapiro, who criticized Obama back in 2009 and is now often critical of Trump. \n\nNational Review\u2019s Jim Geraghty wondered the same. \u201cRemember how much we condemned then-senator Barack Obama\u2019s pledge to \u2018meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries?\u2019 That wasn\u2019t wrong,\u201d Geraghty wrote. \n\nIt\u2019s unclear what Trump\u2019s meeting will consist of, or what it means for America\u2019s foreign policy strategy with regards to North Korea \u2014 since last night\u2019s announcement, the administration has walked back some of Trump\u2019s statements and tried to make it clear that the meeting, scheduled to perhaps take place before May, should not be read as a negotiation or an agreement, or a move towards demilitarization on the Korean peninsula.\n\nWhile some Republicans are giving Trump the benefit of the doubt, Trump is also keeping up his recent streak of riling up his allies, whether it\u2019s on guns or tariffs or, now, North Korea. \n\nWhy conservatives don\u2019t like meetings with strong men\nShapiro told me that by Trump agreeing to meet with Kim, North Korea had already achieved a victory. \u201cKim is looking for legitimacy; Trump just gave it to him as a presumed co-equal on the world stage.\u201d He added, \u201cIf Trump is the greatest dealmaker ever, then I\u2019m sure everything will be fantastic! But I have some pretty serious doubts, obviously.\u201d\n\nOther conservatives are concerned it just won\u2019t work, arguing that North Korea has a long history of entering into negotiations that come \u201ctantalizingly close\u201d to an arms agreement before backing away. \n\nTom Nichols, a conservative writer and a professor at the US Naval College, told me that Trump\u2019s reality television \u201cdeal-making\u201d experience won\u2019t matter here. \u201cThe president\u2019s faith in his own deal-making is a quintessentially American view, but it presumes that the other guy is interested in a deal,\u201d Nichols told me. \u201cThe North Koreans are interested in North Korea, not in a showcasing a \u2018deal,\u2019 and if the president walks into this assuming that Kim Jong Un wants a deal, he\u2019s going to be unpleasantly surprised.\u201d\n\nIn an op-ed for USA Today, Nichols wrote that there\u2019s a far better chance of total \u201cdisaster\u201d than a Nobel Prize for Trump, given the North Korean diplomatic tradition of, in Nichols\u2019 terms, \u201cbait-and-switch.\u201d \u201cMost likely,\u201d rather than a stirring success for the Trump Administration, Nichols said, \u201cthe White House is about to walk right into a trap the North Koreans have been laying for American presidents since the 1990s.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s especially odd that some on the right are applauding Trump\u2019s willingness to meet with Kim, given their previous statements on Obama\u2019s efforts to meet with intransigent foreign powers was that it was \u201ctroubling.\u201d \n\nIn 2008, National Review\u2019s William J. Bennett wrote, \u201cBarack Obama\u2019s position on negotiating with U.S. enemies betrays a profound misreading of history,\u201d adding that if Obama were to meet with Iranian officials, \u201che will lower the prestige of the office of the president.\u201d \n\nObama\u2019s views on meeting with potentially dangerous governments were the subject of discussion during the second presidential debate between Obama and Sen. John McCain that same year. A conservative super PAC even made an ad targeting the \u201cwithout preconditions\u201d remark in 2008, featuring actors portraying Cuba\u2019s Fidel Castro and Kim Jong Il (Kim Jung Un\u2019s father) laughing about it, concluding with the words, \u201cBarack Obama: No Match for America\u2019s Enemies.\u201d\n\nBut in 2018, a number of Republicans are willing to give Trump\u2019s own meeting with a dictator a chance. \n\n\u201cIf North Korea disarms, President Trump\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize would be well deserved.\u201d\nSome conservatives are arguing that Trump\u2019s business acumen \u2014 and even his reality show past \u2014 could be helpful in pursuing negotiations with the North Korean government and ultimately achieving disarmament. \n\nAt the conservative website The Federalist, Ed Krayewski even said that \u201cit\u2019s possible\u201d for Trump\u2019s experience in running beauty pageants and professional wrestling to play a positive role in negotiations with Pyongyang.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so preposterous to think of diplomacy as a bit like reality television,\u201d he wrote on Friday. \u201cDifferent countries have different priorities and national security interests, but they\u2019re operating on an international stage with an international audience, and the pressure to \u201cget to yes\u201d that can come with that.\u201d\n\nOn the Hill, most Republican congressmen who have issued statements upon the news of Trump\u2019s planned meeting with North Korean officials have been pleased \u2014 Rep. Luke Messer even said in a statement, \u201cIf North Korea talks lead to concrete action, President Trump should be well on his way to his own Nobel Peace Prize.\u201d\n\nIn his own statement, Sen. Lindsey Graham, who had previously said that all-out war with North Korea would be \u201cworth it in terms of long-term stability and national security,\u201d praised President Trump\u2019s \u201cstrong stand against North Korea\u201d that \u201cgives us the best hope in decades\u201d of ending potential nuclear aggression by the North Korea government.\n\nWhat will actually come of Trump\u2019s planned meeting with Kim Jong Un remains largely a mystery. On Friday, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the meeting might not even take place: \u201cThe president will not have the meeting without seeing concrete steps and concrete actions take place by North Korea.\u201d\n\nAnd conservatives, divided now between viewing the meeting as a potential foreign policy coup or an incoming calamity, will likely remain just as in the dark as the rest of us.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Alex Ward", "body": "A bipartisan effort to end US involvement in a bloody, three-year war in Yemen failed in a close Senate vote on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe vote demonstrated growing pushback on President Donald Trump\u2019s coziness with Riyadh, which is leading the war effort in Yemen. That same day, the president met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who was visiting Washington during a country-wide tour.\n\nA disparate group of senators \u2014 Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Mike Lee (R-UT), and Chris Murphy (D-CT) \u2014 drafted and introduced the resolution to stop America\u2019s support for the bloodshed. \u201cThis is one of the great humanitarian disasters of our time,\u201d Sanders told Vox in an interview last week.\n\nBut the GOP-controlled Senate voted to table \u2014 that is, kill \u2014 the resolution that says America shouldn\u2019t assist Saudi Arabia in its three-year fight against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. By a 55-44 margin, a majority of Republicans and some Democrats effectively said the US can still help Riyadh, by refueling its planes and providing intelligence in the Saudi\u2019s brutal air campaign. \n\nSupporters of the resolution claimed it would immediately end America\u2019s involvement in the war; critics said it wouldn\u2019t.\n\nSo far, the conflict has claimed more than 13,500 lives \u2014 many of them in airstrikes. Roughly 20 million Yemenis need humanitarian assistance to meet basic needs \u2014 including food and water \u2014 out of a prewar population of 28 million, and nearly 1 million people are suffering from cholera. However, conditions are so bad there that it is hard to have a reliable tally of any of these measures, which means the situation could be much, much worse.\n\nPart of the reason it\u2019s so hard to navigate Yemen is Riyadh\u2019s relentless bombing campaign. The Saudi military has conducted more than 145,000 missions in Yemen over the past three years. A Saudi general told the Wall Street Journal that about 100,000 of those were combat missions, conducting about 300 missions per day. One human rights group counted around 16,000 Saudi airstrikes in total, killing thousands of civilians in total. \n\nDuring a blockade last year, Saudi Arabia put various restrictions on Yemen\u2019s airspace and seaports, which led to the deaths of more than 5,000 civilians, more than 20 percent of whom were children.\n\nLee, one of the measure\u2019s co-sponsors, told me the push to pass the resolution was also to make a statement about how America goes to war. \u201cWe have a set of processes that have to be followed,\u201d he said, noting that Congress has the constitutional authority to declare war. \u201cIf advocates for this war within our government are confident that this is that important to America\u2019s national security interest, then they should bring forward those arguments and ask for an authorization,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut without that, we have no business getting involved in someone else\u2019s civil war.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration lobbied to defeat the measure. Last week, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis sent a letter to Congress requesting that lawmakers not restrict America\u2019s support for Riyadh\u2019s military. He claimed that stopping US assistance \u201ccould increase civilian casualties, jeopardize cooperation with our partners on counterterrorism, and reduce our influence with the Saudis \u2014 all of which would further exacerbate the situation and humanitarian crisis.\u201d Mattis traveled to the Hill on Tuesday to encourage members of both parties to block the resolution.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Congress has tried to stand up to the president on America\u2019s involvement in Yemen. Last November, the House of Representatives passed a similar resolution to the Senate version. That\u2019s because, by a wide 366-30 margin, the House believed the US is only authorized to fight terrorist groups like ISIS or al-Qaeda. Lawmakers said the US doesn\u2019t have authorization to fight the Houthis.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), who led the House effort, noted his displeasure with the vote in an interview with me but struck a note of optimism. \u201cEventually, we will prevail because our position is on the side of human decency and human rights, consistent with basic American values,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe just need to keeping speaking up for peace and for the children in Yemen.\u201d\n\nScott Paul, a Yemen expert at the humanitarian group Oxfam America, was unhappy with the news, telling me that \u201ctoday should have been the day that the Senate moved to end US involvement in this catastrophe.\u201d But Paul noted that some senators may have voted against the measure because the Senate Foreign Relations Committee may soon take up the issue. \u201cWe expect Congress to take decisive action soon,\u201d he said. \n\nBut Tuesday\u2019s vote was relatively close, and that is important on its own. It\u2019s even more noteworthy because on Tuesday, Trump welcomed Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince and the driving force behind the Yemen war to the White House to discuss their burgeoning relationship and arms sales.\n\nTrump had previously issued statements asking Saudi Arabia to cease violating human rights in Yemen. But in his two public statements alongside MBS, as the crown prince is widely known, at the White House, Trump didn\u2019t mention the word \u201cYemen\u201d once.\n\nOne man drives the Saudi-led war on Yemen\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is seen during a meeting with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office at the White House on March 20, 2018.\n      \n      \n        Kevin Dietsch-Pool/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nMohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto leader, champions the fighting in Yemen. It\u2019s part of his aggressive anti-Iran policy in the Middle East, which led him to intervene in Yemen in support of the internationally recognized government against the Houthis.\n\nIran\u2019s government is a Shia Muslim theocracy; Saudi Arabia\u2019s government is a monarchy closely aligned with the country\u2019s Sunni Muslim religious establishment. The two countries represent two ideological and political poles and have spent decades fighting each other for dominance in the Middle East and for the right to represent the Muslim world.\n\nMBS, along with his father, King Salman, completed a purge of an astonishing 11 princes and dozens of other officials and businessmen last November. That allowed MBS to consolidate even more power in Saudi Arabia, which gives him even more authority to direct Riyadh\u2019s war in Yemen.\n\nTrump continues to support MBS, going so far as to approve his purge in a tweet on November 6. At a joint appearance at the White House on Tuesday, Trump continued to show his backing for MBS and Saudi Arabia writ large.\n\n\u201cThe relationship is probably the strongest it\u2019s ever been,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe understand each other.\u201d\n\nZack Beauchamp contributed to this report.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Andrew Prokop", "body": "Last October, special counsel Robert Mueller indicted Paul Manafort on nine counts, all related to his past work for Ukrainian politicians and the millions of dollars he got from that work.

His investigators have also been scrutinizing some $16 million in loans Manafort got after the 2016 election \u2014 and are looking into whether Manafort promised his lender a Trump administration job in return, according to a report Wednesday by NBC News\u2019s Tom Winter and Hallie Jackson.\n\nMueller alluded to the loans in a court filing Friday, during deliberations over Manafort\u2019s bail package. He wrote that he\u2019d learned of \u201cadditional criminal conduct\u201d from Manafort, including \u201ca series of bank frauds and bank fraud conspiracies.\u201d And he wrote that Manafort had gotten those particular loans \u201cthrough a series of false and fraudulent  Politico\u2019s Josh Gerstein reported Wednesday that Mueller has filed new, sealed charges in the case against Manafort and Rick Gates. This new charging document isn\u2019t yet public, and it\u2019s not clear whom or what it\u2019s about. But these loans seem one obvious possibility.\n\nManafort got $16 million in loans from a bank headed by a Trump adviser after the election\nManafort\u2019s post-election loans have long seemed curious. An excellent report by the New York Times\u2019s Mike McIntire from nearly a year ago laid out the timeline:\n\n\nOn August 19, 2016, Manafort left the Trump campaign, after being pushed out.\nThat same day, Manafort filed papers to create a new shell company: Summerbreeze LLC.\nIn September 2016, Summerbreeze got a $3.5 million loan from Spruce Capital, a New York investment firm whose co-founder has developed Trump hotel projects and that is financially backed by a Ukrainian billionaire. (Manafort\u2019s home in the Hamptons was the collateral.)\nAfter Trump won the election, in late 2016, Summerbeeze got another $9.5 million loan from the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago. And in January 2017, that same bank loaned Manafort $6.5 million more. (All these were, again, collateralized by Manafort\u2019s properties.)\n\nThose last loans seemed particularly odd because, per the Times, the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago \u201cfocuses on affordable mortgages for military veterans,\u201d and the loan to Manafort amounted to more than 5 percent of its total assets. Furthermore, the bank\u2019s head, Stephen Calk, was part of Trump\u2019s economic advisory council during the campaign \u2014 raising questions of impropriety.\n\nNow, NBC\u2019s Winter and Jackson add the news that Mueller\u2019s team is examining whether Manafort had promised Calk a Trump White House job in return for those loans. (He didn\u2019t end up getting any job.) \n\nThe NBC reporters also write that \u201cthe three loans were questioned by other officials at the bank, and one source said that at least one of the bank employees who felt pressured into approving the deals is cooperating with investigators.\u201d (A spokesperson for Manafort has said that the loans had above-market-rate interest and were overcollateralized.)\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of news in the Manafort/Gates case lately\nIf there is a new bank fraud charge against Manafort, it would turn up the heat on him even further. \n\nThere have been several recent reports suggesting that Manafort\u2019s longtime business partner Rick Gates, who was indicted alongside him last October, is on the verge of \u201cflipping\u201d and making a plea deal with Mueller\u2019s team. That, however, hasn\u2019t been publicly confirmed yet.\n\nMeanwhile, on Tuesday, a lawyer who had worked with Manafort and Gates on their Ukraine work \u2014 Alex van der Zwaan \u2014 pleaded guilty to making false statements. He admitted to lying to Mueller\u2019s team about when his last communications with Gates and another unnamed person took place, and lying about deleting and not providing relevant emails to investigators.\n\nNow there is the new report that new charges have already been filed in the Manafort case. Those could involve Gates flipping, or a new bank fraud charge against Manafort, or something else entirely \u2014 we won\u2019t know until the new charging document is unsealed.\n\nAll this could be aimed mainly at bolstering Mueller\u2019s case against Manafort.

The Cook Political Report rates the district R+11 (due in part to partisan gerrymandering that the state Supreme Court recently ruled unconstitutional). \n\nThe newly open seat was held by former Rep. Tim Murphy (R-PA) since 2003, who was so secure in his seat that he often failed to attract a Democratic challenger. Murphy suddenly resigned in October amid revelations that he had pressured a woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair to have an abortion. But even after he stepped down, national Democrats didn\u2019t think they could compete in the special election, a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee operative told Vox. \n\nThat was, until Democrat Conor Lamb came along. \n\nLamb is a 33-year-old Marine and former assistant US attorney who prosecuted drug dealers in the midst of Pennsylvania\u2019s deadly opioid crisis. New to politics, he has struck a decidedly independent tone, making headlines when he said he would not support House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi as the Democratic leader if a blue wave sweeps the House in 2018.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got local ties; he\u2019s a local guy,\u201d said Tim Waters, political director for the United Steelworkers Political Action Committee. \u201cHe\u2019s a young guy with a lot of energy ... right down the line on issues that affect workers in this district.\u201d\n\nFocused almost exclusively on local issues, Lamb has nevertheless stumbled into a long-running debate about how the Democratic Party can claw its way back to the majority after 2016. \n\nFocused on recapturing blue-collar workers, Lamb\u2019s campaign represents one school of thought \u2014 going back to labor-liberal economic values and working with unions to retake territory in Midwest and Rust Belt states that voted for Donald Trump in 2016. Others say the party must look to its future: voters of color and young people who represent its energized base, like it did to pull out a win for Doug Jones in Alabama\u2019s December special election for US Senate. \n\nStill others, including former Vice President Joe Biden, say Democrats can do both. At a recent speech in front of House Democrats, Biden said the notion that Democrats have to choose between blue-collar workers and their progressive base was a \u201cfalse debate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a false debate we\u2019re having among ourselves, in my opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s not rip ourselves apart in a debate that is irrelevant.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are in a good position going into the 2018 midterms, especially given the current backlash against Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress. This is in part due to fundamentals that favor the party out of power in midterm elections, but President Trump\u2019s unpopularity has also given Democrats across the country something to rally around. And special elections have been very good for Democrats so far; they have swept a number of state races in red districts in Virginia, Wisconsin, and Kentucky, plus the Senate race in Alabama. \n\nLamb rarely mentions Trump in his campaign speeches. But his candidacy is an important post-2016 test of whether the party can successfully run moderate candidates in deeply red Rust Belt districts that swung for the president two years ago.\n\nEven if Lamb loses in March, he\u2019ll have another opportunity to compete again in the fall in an 18th District that looks different (and more favorable to Democrats), given the new congressional map drawn up by Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court. But if he wins, it will be another sign that Democratic momentum is strong and barreling toward November.\n\nWho\u2019s on the ballot on March 13\nLamb\u2019s opponent is Pennsylvania state Rep. Rick Saccone, a Republican who has described himself as \u201cTrump before Trump was Trump.\u201d Trump is certainly popular in the district, which he won by 20 points in 2016 (Mitt Romney won it by 16 points in 2012). Saccone is a decidedly conservative Republican who is pro-life, pro-gun, anti-government spending, and \u2014 perhaps most importantly in this heavily unionized district \u2014 vehemently anti-union. \n\n\u201cSaccone is a movement conservative,\u201d said Mike DeVanney, a longtime Republican political operative in Pennsylvania who worked on past Murphy campaigns. \u201cHis base is much more to the right than Murphy\u2019s was.\u201d\n\nDeVanney described the likelihood of a Democrat winning the 18th as a \u201cherculean task,\u201d especially considering Republican-allied groups are outspending Democrats 17 to 1. Republican and Democratic operatives in Pennsylvania agree on two things: Lamb is still very much the underdog in this race, but by getting support from unions that used to back Murphy and capitalizing on national Democratic enthusiasm, he has a fighting chance. (Lamb\u2019s campaign did not make him available for an interview despite repeated requests from Vox. Saccone\u2019s campaign also did not return an interview request.) \n\nThis is reflected in recent poll numbers showing Saccone\u2019s former double-digit lead has diminished significantly. A recent Monmouth poll shows the Republican with a slight lead, hovering around 49 percent to 46 percent (models with lower turnout give Saccone a slightly larger lead). Given the steep odds, these numbers are extremely good for Lamb. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s enthusiasm I haven\u2019t seen for a Democratic candidate for a long time,\u201d said veteran Pennsylvania Democratic political consultant Mike Mikus, who lives in the 18th Congressional District. \u201cI don\u2019t think the national Republicans would be spending all this money if they thought it was a slam-dunk.\u201d\n\nWhat kind of Democrat can win PA-18?\nIf Lamb is going to win on March 13, political experts say he needs to straddle a moderate political line, which he\u2019s so far been able to do. \n\nThere are technically 70,000 more registered Democrats in the 18th Congressional District than Republicans, but many of those voters have been casting ballots for GOP candidates for years. Mikus, who has worked on Democratic campaigns in the state for years, says Lamb needs to prove himself as an independent if he\u2019s going to win over these voters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much a conservative district as it is an economic populist district,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to support the NRA down the line, but respect the right of people to own firearms ... and [be] someone that\u2019s willing to stand up to the national party when they feel it\u2019s in the interest of the district or the region.\u201d\n\nThough Lamb is from a well-known Pittsburgh Democratic family (his grandfather served as the Pennsylvania state Senate Democratic majority leader), it\u2019s his first time running for office. He is keeping a careful distance from the national political party, drawing notice for his comments on Pelosi and not accepting Super PAC money. \n\nHis platform hits a lot of Pennsylvania\u2019s biggest issues: jobs, protecting entitlements like Social Security and Medicare, organized labor, and helping end the heroin crisis currently ravaging the state. And he\u2019s not trying to model himself as a progressive darling; a practicing Catholic, he says that while he personally opposes abortion, he supports Roe v. Wade as the law of the land. As a veteran, he is also pro-Second Amendment. \n\n\u201cConor, I think so far, has done a fairly good job as portraying himself as someone that\u2019s going to fight for the region,\u201d Mikus said. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously getting outspent, but I think he\u2019s saying the right things on TV and on the stump.\u201d\n\nSaccone and the Republicans have an obvious advantage when it comes to money; the national Republican Party and conservative groups are dumping cash into the race and bringing out the big players to stump for Saccone: President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and Ivanka Trump have made all made public appearances with the candidate. \n\nSaccone is also benefiting from a deluge of outside spending. The Washington Post\u2019s Dave Weigel and Michael Scherer estimated Republican-allied groups have so far spent about $4.7 million in television and radio ads compared to the approximately $300,000 Democratic groups have raised for Lamb.\n\nBut when it comes to the campaigns themselves, Lamb is outraising Saccone 2 to 1.  Federal Election Commission records show that Lamb finished 2017 having raised about $557,551. Meanwhile, Saccone raised a total of $214,675. A chunk of that was not fundraised \u2014 Saccone loaned himself $11,000, and his campaign transferred another $41,899 over from a previous committee financing a Senate bid of Saccone\u2019s that never got off the ground.\n\nPolitical operatives say it\u2019s another indication of the enthusiasm behind the Democrat. And in a race that\u2019s sure to be spun as a referendum on Trump\u2019s presidency no matter who wins, many say it\u2019s much more about the two candidates and the local issues in the 18th.\n\n\u201cThis is hopefully going to be about these two candidates,\u201d Waters said. \u201cIf it is, Conor Lamb is a rising star.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 best hope might be aligning with unions\nEven though PA-18 is a deeply red district, it\u2019s also strong union territory. It contains more than 87,000 union members and their family members, everyone from building trades to energy workers to teachers. \n\nSteelworkers are active, and although the district\u2019s last coal mine recently closed down, tens of thousands of retired union coal workers and their spouses remain in the area. Mikus estimated they could make up 20 to 25 percent of the electorate, while a DCCC operative estimates it\u2019s closer to 30 percent.\n\nLabor union members were also a huge demographic for Trump in 2016; after the presidential race, national exit polls showed Democrat Hillary Clinton had captured 51 percent of union households, 7 points less than President Obama in 2012. Meanwhile, Trump captured 42 percent of union households, a slight bump from Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nFormer Rep. Tim Murphy, the onetime chair of the Congressional Steel Caucus, courted building trades unions for years and won the support of many. Saccone is doing the exact opposite, currying favor from right-to-work groups via his reputation for authoring state bills trying to end paid union leave for teachers who were working for their unions outside of the classroom, and voting for other bills targeting unionized workers.\n\n\u201cUnlike Tim Murphy, who really made his career as a Republican reaching out to labor ... Rick Saccone is the exact opposite,\u201d Mikus said.\n\nWaters, the political director for the United Steelworkers PAC, put it another way.\n\n\u201cTim Murphy was more of candidate that would say what he thought people wanted to hear,\u201d Waters said. \u201cRick Saccone is a zealot. Murphy was more like, \u2018Test the water.\u2019 This guy just jumps in with a belly flop.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s having an impact among union leaders, even ones who spent years supporting Murphy. Nearly all the major unions have thrown their support behind Lamb and are helping him mount an organized door-knocking campaign throughout the district.\n\n\u201cI think most of the building trades who had supported Murphy and helped give him large margins are going to the Democrat,\u201d said DeVanney, the Republican strategist.\n\nWhat\u2019s yet to be seen is whether union leaders can successfully convince their rank and file to go to the ballot box and cast their votes for Lamb in March. But they are certainly trying; Waters said political and union organizers have already knocked on tens of thousands of doors and will hit more in the coming weeks. He compares the enthusiasm to Alabama\u2019s special election that helped propel the state\u2019s first Democratic candidate in 25 years to the US Senate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the biggest union in this congressional district,\u201d Waters said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work until the last minute on Election Day. We\u2019re going to make sure we talk to every single union voter,\u201d as well as retirees and their families.\n\nLamb\u2019s performance in the special election is a test case for what could happen in November\nEven if Lamb loses, he\u2019ll have a completely different district to compete in during future races (should he decide to do so). \n\nIn 2010, Pennsylvania\u2019s Republican-controlled state legislature drafted congressional maps that made it near impossible for a Democrat like Lamb to win in the 18th District.\n\nAs Vox\u2019s Andrew Prokop wrote: \n\n\nUgly-looking districts don\u2019t always point to gerrymandering, but in this case, they do \u2014 Republicans tried to pack Democratic-leaning areas together into very few districts while surrounding the state\u2019s big cities with districts Republicans would win comfortably.\n\nTo get a sense of how powerful Pennsylvania\u2019s gerrymander was, consider that in 2012, Democratic candidates won slightly more votes in US House elections and Barack Obama won the state. But the state\u2019s 18 House seats didn\u2019t split 9-9 between the parties \u2014 instead, Republicans won 13 seats there, and Democrats just won five. No seats changed partisan hands in the 2014 or 2016 elections, either.\n\n\nBut given a recent Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling that resulted in the state redrawing its congressional districts, the updated 18th District will include parts of liberal Pittsburgh, which should make it much friendlier to Democrats. It\u2019s far from the only district that\u2019s changing; the new map reflects population changes more accurately, splits fewer counties, and will likely lead to many more competitive elections between Democrats and Republicans. \n\nThese changes won\u2019t kick in by March 13, so Lamb and Pennsylvania Democrats have extra incentive to see if they can pull off a long-shot campaign in a district where the odds are still stacked against him. They feel confident, and cautiously optimistic.\n\n\u201cI like the choice in this thing,\u201d Waters said. \u201cI like our chances.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Zack Beauchamp", "body": "Shortly after President Trump ousted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and tapped CIA Director Mike Pompeo to take his place, State Department spokesman Steve Goldstein issued a statement on the firing that\u2019s frankly astonishing. \n\nGoldstein confirmed that Tillerson was fired, a rarity in a Washington where \u201cresigns to spend more time with his family\u201d is the norm. But it goes further than that, revealing that Trump did not inform Tillerson of the reason for his firing or even speak to his secretary personally before dismissing him. \n\nI\u2019ve been in Washington covering foreign policy and politics for nearly a decade now. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this statement. Here\u2019s the full text, as emailed to reporters:\n\n\nThe Secretary had every intention of staying because of the critical progress made in national security. He will miss his colleagues at the the [sic] Department of State and the foreign ministers he has worked with throughout the world.\n\nThe Secretary did not speak to the President and is unaware of the reason, but he is grateful for the opportunity to serve, and still believes strongly that public service is a noble calling.\n\nWe wish Secretary Designate Pompeo well.\n\n\nLet\u2019s count the eye-opening things here.\n\n\nTrump, whose television catchphrase was \u201cyou\u2019re fired,\u201d couldn\u2019t bring himself to fire America\u2019s top diplomat in person. This is similar to how he fired former FBI Director James Comey, sending his former bodyguard Keith Schiller to deliver the news. The two incidents together confirm frequent press accounts that, for all his bravado, Trump actually is loath to fire people himself.\nTillerson reportedly only found about his firing when Trump tweeted about it on Tuesday morning. This statement likely represents shock on the State Department\u2019s part as well.\nThe lead State Department spokesman is openly insulting the president by leaking details about Tillerson\u2019s dismissal that paint him in a negative light.\nTillerson, whose tenure at Foggy Bottom was widely seen among foreign policy experts as one of the worst (if not the worst) in modern history, still believed that he was doing a good job at the time of his firing.\nIt\u2019s still unclear why, exactly, the secretary of state was just fired at this particular moment in his spectacularly unimpressive tenure as America\u2019s top diplomat.\n\nIn the Trump administration, chaos is something of a norm. But is is shocking even when grading on that curve.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matthew Yglesias", "body": "Paul Manafort left his job working as the Kremlin\u2019s favorite expat political consultant in Ukraine in the Spring of 2016 to go run his old acquaintance Donald Trump\u2019s longshot presidential campaign on a volunteer basis. \n\nSoon after, Moscow-backed hackers transmitted thousands of stolen Democratic Party emails to WikiLeaks, whose release was artfully timed to make trouble for Trump\u2019s Democratic opponents. They became the basis of Trump campaign rhetoric in the months before Election Day.  \n\nEmerging conventional wisdom in Washington, however, remains that there\u2019s little reason to believe that Robert Mueller\u2019s ongoing investigation will end up proving much of interest. Politico magazine editor-in-chief Blake Hounshell this weekend wrote one of the buzziest pieces advocating a skeptical approach to Mueller\u2019s ongoing inquiry, titled \u201cConfessions of a Russiagate Skeptic,\u201d throwing cold water on the notion of high-level cooperation between Trumpworld and the Russians.  \n\nBut to believe this, frankly, requires a much greater suspension of disbelief than to posit that the president colluded with Russia. You have to believe that after a decade of paying Manafort millions for his expertise to help pro-Russian candidates win elections in Ukraine, no one from Moscow thought to consult with him about how to help a pro-Russia candidate win an election in the United States. \n\nAnd we have to believe that even though we know Trump\u2019s son was both in touch with WikiLeaks and openly enthusiastic about the idea of collaborating with Russia on obtaining and disseminating anti-Hillary Clinton dirt, when he met with Russians on this very topic, they didn\u2019t talk about it. And, of course, we have to believe that Trump\u2019s specific \u2014 and quite public \u2014 call for Putin to hack more Clinton emails was completely random.\n\nTrump\u2013Russia skeptics, legion in the political press, brush all this aside in a gesture of faux-sophistication, positing a bizarre series of coincidences complete with a massive cover-up all \u2014 for no particular reason. \n\n\nTo speak the obvious has become nearly forbidden. But here goes: Donald Trump has gone to extraordinary lengths over the course of his time in office to try to stymie or discredit rigorous investigation of the Russia matter. The most likely explanation for why he has done it is that he is guilty of serious Russia-related wrongdoing. \n\nThere are viable alternative hypotheses, like he's a huge moron or he\u2019s guilty of some other serious wrongdoing that he fears an investigation will uncover. But the best bet is that things are exactly as they seem and he\u2019s acting guilty because he\u2019s guilty. \n\nDonald Trump is not stupid\nOne thing Trump\u2019s supporters tend to get right is that the political media in the United States is generally far too willing to paint a portrait of Trump as some kind of dolt. But everything in Trump\u2019s record suggests a cunning, ruthless, and, in many ways, insightful man \u2014 not some kind of Forrest Gump-like figure ambling through history.\n\nA few examples: \n\n\nThe means he used to get himself out of bankruptcy and make his big Atlantic City comeback were incredibly shady and dishonest, but also genuinely clever. \nHis reinvention of himself as an asset-light brand licensor was incredibly successful, as was his career as a television show host.\n He has, for years, used lawyer Michael Cohen and a relationship with a major tabloid conglomerate to keep affairs hushed up and manipulate the public\u2019s image of him. \nLast but by no means least, he ambled into the 2016 GOP primary field with little fundraising, no political experience, and minimal organization and wiped the floor with everyone. \n\nPeople who cover American politics for a living are accustomed to covering politicians who have at least a passing familiarity with the main issues in public policy, and Trump does not. He answers questions about national politics like he\u2019s a real estate developer turned brand licensing magnate and reality television star, which he is. \n\nI\u2019m not here to tell you that Trump is an evil genius or a criminal mastermind. And he\u2019s certainly more impulsive than your average politician or business leader. But he\u2019s not an idiot. When he keeps on doing something, it\u2019s probably for a reason. \n\nThe choking clouds of smoke\nI hate the word \u201ccollusion.\u201d It\u2019s a technical, legal term derived from the unrelated world of antitrust law that\u2019s masked the simplicity of what we\u2019re talking about. It seems more likely than not that some Trumpworld personnel coordinated some elements of political strategy with the Russian pro-Trump information operation with the tacit or explicit approval of Trump himself, and that they signaled openness to Russia-friendly policy changes Russia in exchange. \n\nHere\u2019s are the main elements of the case: \n\n\nMany of the Russian government\u2019s political interventions abroad are clumsy and inept (see the anti-Macron stuff from the 2017 French presidential election and the bulk of the \u201ctroll farm\u201d stuff). But the WikiLeaks email drops of 2016 were very well-executed and well-timed to step on two major stories, first the Democratic National Convention and later the Access Hollywood tape. Perhaps the Russians got lucky (twice) or they executed well because they were helped by an expert American political operative.\nAs it happens, the expertise of Trump\u2019s campaign chair, Paul Manafort, is in American and foreign electioneering. Manafort helped Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush win presidential elections before he moved into lobbying and took his political skills abroad. He spent a decade dispensing expert political advice (for a steep price) to a Russian proxy party in Ukraine. So it\u2019s not like the Russians would have no idea who to ask, or that nobody on the Trump team was comfortable, broadly speaking, with the idea of working with Moscow. \nWe also know specifically, thanks to Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s infamous \u201cif it\u2019s what you say, I love it\u201d email, that not only Manafort but also Trump\u2019s son and his son-in-law were eager to collaborate with the Russian government on the 2016 election.\nTrump spent more than a year on the campaign trail consistently praising Vladimir Putin and defending him from critics, incurring political risks with no obvious upside for himself. \nDuring the transition, Trump\u2019s top national security adviser Michael Flynn was very eager to conduct talks with Moscow about a warming of relations. Kushner was trying to create some kind of secure back-channel line of communication to Moscow that would be impenetrable by American intelligence. \nTrump took the exceptionally risky move of firing FBI Director James Comey. After that backfired, he took repeated stabs at trying to lean on Attorney General Jeff Sessions and/or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to resign, which would give him more direct control over Mueller. \nTrump\u2019s allies on the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee have been trying to help him with various attacks on the FBI, the Justice Department, and the whole idea of an inquiry rather than by constructing some plausible alternative narrative that would explain all the weird shit referenced above. \n\nThat\u2019s not an argument you\u2019d present to secure a jury conviction, but it\u2019s probable cause for a rigorous investigation. It all explains Mueller\u2019s apparent strategy of bringing legal pressure to bear on as many Trumpworld figures as possible. It\u2019s a sound strategy for generating the revelation of some dark secrets.\n\nTrump is good at keeping secrets\nThe Trump era has led to a lot of amazing, compulsively readable journalism that undersells Trump\u2019s ability to keep secrets. \n\nHounshell writes that \u201cso much damaging information poured out of Trump Tower that it\u2019s hard to believe a conspiracy to collude with Moscow to win the election never went public\u201d and that \u201cif there was such a conspiracy, it must have been a very closely guarded secret.\u201d\n\nBut consider that despite Trumpworld\u2019s reputation for leaking like a sieve, we\u2019ve never found out what\u2019s on Trump\u2019s income tax returns or how the decision was made that whatever is on them is more damning than Trump\u2019s shady behavior. We don\u2019t know why Trump decided to fire Flynn (the stated reason that he \u201clied to Mike Pence\u201d doesn\u2019t pass the laugh test), whether he was told of the domestic abuse allegations against former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter, what\u2019s on the Apprentice outtakes footage that producer Mark Burnett is keeping locked up, why exactly Trump handed some choice Israeli intelligence to the Russian foreign minister, who financed the hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, or any of a dozen other major questions about Trump.\n\nThe reality is that Trump was the least-transparent candidate of all time and is running one of the least-transparent administrations on record. It\u2019s a White House where even whether or not the president is golfing on any given weekend is the subject of dissembling and fabrication. \n\nOne result of unprecedented secrecy is an unprecedented volume of disclosures. But that doesn\u2019t mean we actually have an unprecedented level of insight into what\u2019s going on with Trump or his operation. Quite the opposite. \n\nEspecially given congressional Republicans\u2019 total abdication of Congress\u2019s normal oversight functions, Mueller\u2019s inquiry is essentially our only lens into some very murky terrain. And the investigators themselves are keeping their cards close to their chests. \n\nMueller\u2019s investigation is already bearing fruit\nPerhaps this will prove wrong and ultimately the Mueller investigation will uncover nothing of note except crimes committed by Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, his former campaign manager and deputy campaign manager, and a handful of lesser players while having also exposed both the president himself and essentially his entire senior staff as habitual liars on a manner of criminal and national security import.\n\nIf true, that would qualify as probably the biggest presidential scandal since Iran-Contra a generation ago. It\u2019s also already had the ancillary benefit of inspiring lots of DC shops to start actually complying with Foreign Agent Registration Act rules.\n\n\n\nThe new filing this morning from Bob Mueller is a reminder to anyone trying to draw final conclusions: He is far from done with this investigation.\n\u2014 Matt Viser (@mviser) February 20, 2018\n\n\n\n\nLast but by no means least, it seems clear that whether or not there was an explicit or tacit agreement on this point, Trump entered office intending to pivot American foreign policy in a more pro-Russian direction and installed Flynn as national security adviser and Rex Tillerson as secretary of state with a view to implementing that agenda. \n\nThe investigation \u2014 dating back to before James Comey\u2019s firing and Mueller\u2019s appointment \u2014 seems to have played a big role in scuttling this and pushing Trump to maintain broad continuity with prior American foreign policy. \n\nThe one place I do agree with Mueller skeptics is that liberals shouldn\u2019t get their hopes up that the special counsel will \u201csave\u201d them or the country from Trump. Trump appeared on national television and explained to an NBC News audience that he improperly used his powers of office to remove the FBI director in an effort to shield his friends and associates from criminal scrutiny. The institutional Republican Party shrugged that off and, eventually, the public moved on. \n\nMy guess is that whatever revelations are forthcoming from Mueller will fit a similar pattern \u2014 most people already have a negative view of Trump so it\u2019s hard to move the needle too much more on public opinion, and the whole GOP has already wagered so heavily on the Trump experiment that they\u2019re not going to pull the plug regardless of what happened. \n\nBut politics aside, the suspicion of illicit collaboration between the highest-ranking members of the Trump campaign and the Russian pro-Trump information operation is well-founded, and the ongoing criminal investigation into that possibility is steadily bearing fruit. There\u2019s no earthly reason for journalists to adopt a stance of preemptively exonerating Trump when, so far, suspicion has been validated at nearly every turn.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "German Lopez", "body": "Three months after Vox broke the story about how Wyoming law enforcement wrongly took $91,800 from an out-of-state traveler during a traffic stop, state legislators have changed the law to try to prevent something like this from happening again.\n\nDemocratic state Rep. Charles Pelkey told me that he \u201cwould never have introduced this bill had I not read your story.\u201d The measure passed with bipartisan support in both chambers of the legislature, and it was signed by Republican Gov. Matt Mead last week.\n\nVox was tipped off about the story by the Institute for Justice, an advocacy group that works against wrongful police seizures of cash and property, particularly civil forfeiture. The group represented Phil Parhamovich of Wisconsin, helping him get his money back from Wyoming law enforcement at a court hearing just hours after Vox\u2019s story was published.\n\nParhamovich was stopped in March 2017 while traveling on I-80 in Wyoming during a concert tour with his band, the Dirt Brothers. Parhamovich, who has no criminal record, was not accused of or charged with a serious crime; he only got a $25 ticket for improperly wearing his seat belt and a warning for \u201clane use.\u201d\n\nBut Wyoming law enforcement officers found and eventually seized the $91,800 in cash, as it was hidden in a speaker cabinet \u2014 by getting Parhamovich, under what he says was duress, to sign away his interest in the money through a waiver. According to Parhamovich, police pushed him to sign the waiver after he said the money was not his, following aggressive questioning that he said made him fear that carrying that much cash is illegal. (It is not.)\n\nThe new law, which takes effect on July 1, bans officers from getting people to sign waivers that give up their rights to property, including cash, without a hearing and without establishing probable cause. Any waivers in violation of the law are declared \u201cnull and void.\u201d\n\nThe waivers provided a loophole around previous reforms\nParhamovich got his money back following a court hearing in December, where he and his attorney, the Institute for Justice\u2019s Anya Bidwell, were met by legislators from Wyoming, who had read Vox\u2019s story and reached out to the Institute for Justice to see what they could do to help. According to Bidwell and one of the state legislators who was present, the judge agreed that if Parhamovich was willing to testify that the money was his, he would order the state to give the money back. When Parhamovich agreed, the judge ruled in his favor. \n\nParhamovich said in a statement that it\u2019s \u201ca great relief to know that no one will have to go through what I went through. Obviously our police system is in need of many reforms but this is a step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nParhamovich intends to use the money as a down payment to buy a music studio in Madison, Wisconsin, called Smart Studios, where Nirvana and the Smashing Pumpkins recorded songs. Without the cash, Parhamovich was worried that the deal for the studio could fall through after a nine-month lease expired. But now he\u2019s able to move forward to close the deal.\n\nThe case was similar to other stories that have come out over the past few years about police abusing what\u2019s called civil forfeiture, which allows law enforcement to seize and absorb private property, from cash to cars to boats, without ever charging the owner with a crime. To do this under civil forfeiture, police only need probable cause to believe the property is linked to criminal activity, typically drug trafficking. Police can then absorb the value of this property as profit, either through state programs or under a federal program known as \u201cequitable sharing\u201d that lets local and state police get up to 80 percent of the value of what they seize as money for their departments.\n\nCritics have long decried civil forfeiture for creating a perverse incentive for law enforcement to essentially police for profit.\n\nParhamovich\u2019s case was unique in that police seemed to bypass civil forfeiture law \u2014 including reforms enacted by Wyoming in 2016 \u2014 by getting him to sign a waiver that supposedly gave up his interest in the cash. The new law effectively closes the loophole.\n\nThe Institute for Justice cheered the move in a statement but argued that Wyoming still needs further reforms to prevent more abuses of forfeiture in the future.\n\n\u201cDue process doesn\u2019t happen on the side of a road and we\u2019re pleased to see Wyoming ban this abusive tactic,\u201d Institute for Justice attorney Dan Alban said. \u201cBut the state\u2019s civil forfeiture laws remained unchanged, and still need major reform. No one should lose their property without being convicted of a crime.\u201d\n\nFor more on Parhamovich\u2019s case, read Vox\u2019s full story.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matthew Yglesias", "body": "Conor Lamb unquestionably struck some culturally conservative notes \u2014 touting his military experience and his support for gun rights while downplaying immigration and racial justice topics \u2014 on the way to his victory.

A Roman Catholic, he says he personally opposes abortion.\n\nBut he opposes the GOP-proposed 20-week ban on abortions and has seen his views come under attack during the special election. And in an interview, he emphasized that the country was founded on the principle of separating church and state.\n\n\u201cTo me, that means we defend the law as it is,\u201d he said.\n\n\nAnd, naturally, before Election Day, conservatives were very clear about this. National Review ran an article, as they tend to once every few years, explaining that Lamb\u2019s position on this is at odds with Catholic doctrine, which holds that a religious obligation exists to try to affirmatively prevent abortions from happening.\n\nObviously, words are just words. We could describe politicians with Lamb\u2019s view as \u201cpro-life\u201d if we wanted to. But no anti-abortion groups consider his position to be acceptable, and no pro-choice groups consider it especially problematic. By all the normal rules of American politics, he is pro-choice and not pro-life. \n\nInterestingly, as Roarty notes, Lamb is not alone in this regard. In the recent past, abortion was an issue on which it was common to see Democrats running in tough districts take heterodox positions. These days you still see that frequently on guns, topics related to fossil fuel extraction, and possibly immigration. \n\nBut on abortion, essentially every prominent Democratic challenger \u2014 including Sen.

Democrats are promoting increases to education spending, medical research, and how they fended off major conservative poison pills, like efforts to defund Planned Parenthood or expand immigrant detention centers. Republicans are celebrating the huge increases to military spending and a small bundle of border wall funding.\n\nBut this time leaders have also couched their celebratory speeches with a dose of reality: No one is the absolute winner.\n\n\u201cThe result is legislation that neither sides sees as perfect but which contains a host of significant victories and important achievements on behalf of the American people,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said on the Senate floor Thursday.\n\nEven so, here are some of the clear winners and losers. \n\nLoser: Trump\u2019s immigration agenda\nPut simply, this spending bill does not reflect the hardline immigration agenda Trump and his White House have long espoused.\n\nOn enforcement, Republicans went into this week wanting more funding for the Department of Homeland Security to both increase the number of beds for immigrant detainees and to expand the enforcement force, with a call to fund 1,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and 500 more Customs and Border Protection officers. \n\nThe final compromise: funding for only an additional 328 additional Customs and Border Protection officers and ICE will actually have to reduce the number detention beds. Needless to say, this isn\u2019t the kind of deportation force Trump\u2019s administration was envisioning. The bill also does not defund so-called \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d something the White House specifically called on Congress to do.\n\nIt does include some border wall funding \u2014 $1.6 billion worth \u2014 which is much less than the $25 billion the White House asked for. And it comes with a lot of strings attached; most of the funding will have to go toward repairing existing fencing or toward double fencing where barriers already exist. In other words, this isn\u2019t money for Trump\u2019s big, beautiful wall. \n\nAs I reported last week, Trump\u2019s White House has been frustrated with the spending bill \u2014 especially on immigration. Trump officials even tried to back-channel conservative ideas with allies in Congress to defund \u201csanctuary cities\u201d or push for more border wall spending, but to no avail. Trump reportedly threatened to veto the bill yesterday but was walked off the ledge.\n\nAs Vox\u2019s Dara Lind writes, not only did Trump get very little of what he asked for, \u201cCongress is actually making an effort to rein in the Trump administration\u2019s overspending on immigration detention instead of expanding it.\u201d\n\nWinner: the Republican tax bill\nWhen Republicans rushed their tax bill through Congress at the end of last year, they made mistakes.\n\nThe biggest: Republicans accidentally created a massive disparity in the agricultural industry.\n\nThe technical error \u2014 dubbed the \u201cgrain glitch\u201d \u2014 essentially gave more lucrative tax deductions to farmers who sold agricultural products, like grains, to farm cooperatives instead of privately owned farms. The benefits of selling to cooperatives under the GOP tax law are so large that the Wall Street Journal reported it could let some farmers reduce their taxable income to zero. \n\nThe error gave cooperatives \u2014 including farming giants like Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. \u2014 the major advantage and put smaller privately owned agricultural businesses at risk of closing shop. Needless, to say the \u201cgrain glitch\u201d was a major priority for lawmakers representing America\u2019s agricultural regions. \n\nIn some last-minute negotiations, Democrats, who have been reluctant to help Republicans fix their tax bill, struck a deal to amend the tax law\u2019s language to fix the \u201cgrain glitch\u201d in exchange for expanding the low-income housing tax credit that goes toward building more affordable housing. The Internal Revenue Service also got a $196 budget boost to help implement the new tax law.\n\nLoser: Betsy DeVos\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Congress rejected DeVos\u2019s agenda.\n      \n      \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos had some grand plans for the Department of Education, including budget cuts for public schools and after-school programs in exchange for $1 billion in spending to promote school choice programs, vouchers, and magnets. She wanted to eliminate a grant program for low-income students to go to college and slash $1.7 million from the Office of Civil Rights, a bureau within the Education Department that ensures equal access to education and enforces civil rights in school, which she said had grown inefficient.\n\nShe got none of those things.\n\nInstead, Congress\u2019s spending bill was a clear rejection of DeVos\u2019s education agenda. The spending bill included a $3.9 billion increase to the department\u2019s funding. \n\nGoing down the list, DeVos\u2019s requests were ignored on almost every front.\n\nThere was no funding for private school vouchers or her \u201cpublic school choice\u201d initiative, and the bill increased funding for the Office of Civil Rights by $8.5 million.\n\nDeVos called to freeze the Pell Grant award for low-income students at $5,920. Lawmakers increased the ceiling to $6,095. The federal work-study program, which Trump\u2019s administration proposed to cut in half, also got a funding boost.\n\nThe omnibus also included more funding for school-based mental health programs, which DeVos\u2019s budget cut, and increased funding for the Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant, which goes toward financing low-income students\u2019 college expenses, by $107 million. The DC Tuition Assistance Grant, which aids Washington DC, students who don\u2019t have access to an affordable in-state university system, got a $40 million boost. DeVos had proposed cutting the program this year and eliminating altogether by 2019.\n\nWinner: government data\nWith a 2020 Census on the horizon, the Census Bureau will get another $1.34 billion in funding, double what the Trump administration\u2019s budget called for \u2014 and a Democratic priority.\n\nThe Census Bureau has been at the center of a funding battle with Congress for some time, and, as Vox\u2019s Dylan Matthews\u2019 explained, has had to find some creative ways to cut costs ahead of its 2020 nationwide survey. The information gathered by the census questionnaire and interviews \u2014 which by law is mandated every 10 years \u2014 is used for everything from drawing congressional districts distributing hundreds of millions of federal dollars for infrastructure, schools, and public services. This will be a welcomed boost.\n\nFor the first time ever, the spending bill also requires the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan agency that produces reports on a wide variety of procedural and policy topics, to post all of its reports online. Currently, only some are available to the public, and mostly through third parties.\n\nFinally, the bill also included the Fix NICS Act, a proposal that will reinforce the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), the system gun sellers use to verify if someone is eligible to buy a gun. This bill increases enforcement, steps up requirements for federal and state agencies to update records, gives states financial incentives to report to NICS, and penalizes agencies that don\u2019t upload their records.\n\nAll around, a win for government databases.\n\nLoser: Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME)\nBack in the day ... in December, Sen. Susan Collins was promised a vote on two Obamacare stabilization bills in exchange for her vote on the GOP tax bill. She voted for the tax cuts, which also repealed the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate, the tax on individuals for not having health insurance that is projected expected to increase premiums by 10 percent.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t see a vote on the health care bills in return.\n\nThe latest iteration of the Obamacare stabilization package, which Collins co-sponsored with Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), would have funded the cost-sharing reduction subsidies, which help insurance companies keep down premium costs, for three years, and also pumped billions of dollars for reinsurance funding, which essentially backstops insurance companies expenses with high-cost patients. The idea was to put it in the spending bill.\n\nBut the White House and Republican leadership also included language that would prevent the Obamacare payments from going toward any insurance plan that covers abortions \u2014 which Democrats said would adversely impact low-income women. Neither party was willing to concede, and the Obamacare stabilization funding was dropped altogether.\n\nCollins will have to wait another day to see her long-promised Obamacare stabilization package get a vote.\n\nWinner: federally funded research\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Andy Buchanan/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s budget proposal\u2019s efforts to cut research funding, Congress invested in more federally funded research over past year and loosened restrictions on what federal agencies can research.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health got a $3 billion funding increase for medical research, which both parties have touted as a win. It brings total funding for the agency to $37 billion and includes an additional $414 million for Alzheimer\u2019s research, $140 million more for brain research, and $40 million more for universal flu vaccine research.\n\nThis spending bill was also a small victory for gun violence research. For years, Congress has more or less banned the Center for Disease Control, or any federal agency, from using taxpayer money on public health research about firearms. Technically, the Dickey Amendment barred the CDC from spending any money \u201cto advocate or promote gun control\u201d \u2014 a provision the federal agency largely interpreted as an outright ban.\n\nBut the spending bill clarifies that the law doesn\u2019t actually prevent them from doing the research \u2014 the result of a larger debate Congress has been having about gun control after the tragic school shooting in Parkland, Florida.\n\nLoser: conservatives\nWhen it comes to bipartisan pieces of legislation, conservative lawmakers usually get rolled. In the days leading up to the spending bill\u2019s release, they knew this time would be no different.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the Freedom Caucus, a group of the House\u2019s most conservative lawmakers, to come out against the bill, calling it an \u201cinsult to America\u2019s taxpayers, as well as their many rank-and-file representatives who had no say in the omnibus negotiations,\u201d in a statement less than an hour after the bill was released. \n\nThe Heritage Foundation, one of Washington\u2019s leading conservative think tanks, had a similar sentiment, tweeting that the omnibus was an \u201cembarrassing rundown of broken promises.\u201d \n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-TN) a deficit hawk, called it \u201cgrotesque,\u201d and Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) took it one step further saying the bill was a \u201cgreat-dane-sized whiz down the leg of every taxpayer in this country.\u201d \n\nTheir reactions are no surprise. The $1.3 trillion spending package is a far cry from conservatives\u2019 calls for small government, and almost every contentious conservative policy provision got tossed out \u2014 from defunding Planned Parenthood to defunding sanctuary cities.\n\nInstead, the final bill barely included conservative immigration policies (the $1.6 billion in border wall funding came with a lot of restrictions). And it didn\u2019t pair any expansion of concealed-carry gun laws to the Fix NICS proposal, a light gun control bill that reinforces existing laws around background checks. \n\nNot to mention that conservatives in the Freedom Caucus claim to be process hawks, who like to see bills go through regular order. (Of course, they were less interested in this when it came to tax cuts and repealing Obamacare.) And this massive spending bill was dropped less than 18 hours before the final House vote.\n\nWinner: tipped workers\nIn December, Trump\u2019s Labor Department Secretary Alex Acosta proposed a plan that would essentially allow employers to confiscate their workers\u2019 tips if they pay workers minimum wage or above.\n\nThe proposal would have repealed an Obama-era regulation that gave workers sole propriety over the tips they earned. As Vox\u2019s Alexia Fernandez Campbell explained, the Trump administration\u2019s proposed move could have cost service workers $5.8 billion a year in lost tips.\n\nTo preemptively protect workers, an amendment in the spending bill from Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) will bar employers from taking their workers\u2019 tips. The provision was a major win for service workers, who came out in droves against the Labor Department\u2019s proposed rule change \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t completely void Azar\u2019s proposal. Employers will still be allowed to share a worker\u2019s tips with a larger pool of workers if they are paid the full minimum wage. \n\nHonorable Mention Winner: Sen. James Risch\u2019s ego\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        McConnell begged Risch to allow a vote.\n      \n      \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nAs lawmakers scrambled to get the spending bill passed, the final obstacle wasn\u2019t over funding or policy: Sen. James Risch (R-ID) had a personal gripe with a provision that renamed the White Clouds Wilderness after four-term Gov. Cecil D. Andrus, who died last year \u2014 Risch\u2019s rival.\n\nWhile it\u2019s still unclear how toxic Andrus and Risch\u2019s relationship was, several reports indicate the two clashed over education policy in the 1980s. Apparently, Risch had held enough of a grudge that he didn\u2019t want the Idaho wilderness named after the man.\n\nRisch did not know about the provision \u2014 which had been sponsored by Republican Idaho Rep. Mike Simpson in the House \u2014 until late Thursday. He called on Republican leadership to remove the language and refused to consent to a vote on the final bill. But it was too late to change the bill; removing the language would require the House to vote on the bill again and drag out the process.\n\nAfter much \u201cbegging, pleading, and cajoling\u201d on McConnell\u2019s part \u2014 a private meeting with staff and the senator, with Schumer, Republican leadership, a floor fight and even a phone call to House Speaker Paul Ryan \u2014 the Senate finally voted without removing the provision. The compromise, approved quietly and quickly by unanimous consent: An enrollment correction to the omnibus, which the House will consider later. \n\nRisch\u2019s tantrum dragged Senate proceedings passed midnight, angering lawmakers who were dragged out of bed at 1 am to vote. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) called it \u201cthe most like a Saturday Night Live skit\u201d she\u2019s ever witnessed in her 12 years in the Senate.\n\nRisch is expected to take over one of the Senate\u2019s top committees as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee next year.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Zack Beauchamp", "body": "Rep. Devin Nunes\u2019s infamous memo \u2014 the document numerous House Republicans claimed would demonstrate fundamental anti-Trump corruption at the FBI \u2014 was released early Friday afternoon. The entire thing is three and a half pages and only takes a few minutes to read closely and carefully.\nAfter doing that, there is only one conclusion a fair reader could draw: There is absolutely nothing here. \nThere is no proof in the memo that the FBI is biased against Trump, no proof of abuse of surveillance powers by the FBI, and no proof that the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia are fundamentally flawed. The memo is a piece of partisan spin, and not a particularly compelling one at that.\nRepublicans who claimed it was anything else have been egregiously misrepresenting what the memo actually says.\nThe memo does not support its core claim\nThe memo begins by making a grandiose claim: The FBI\u2019s use of surveillance power under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) during the 2016 campaign was \u201ca troubling breakdown of legal processes established to protect the American people from abuses related to the FISA process.\u201d\nThe only example the memo cites is an October 21, 2016, request by the Department of Justice and FBI for permission under FISA powers to snoop on former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page. The key word there is former: Page had left the Trump campaign at least a month before the application. That\u2019s the first red flag that there\u2019s nothing here, as an FBI campaign to undermine Trump\u2019s campaign would almost certainly involve targeting someone who was actually working on it.\nThe Nunes memo goes on to allege the the Page FISA application, which was ultimately approved by a judge, was fundamentally flawed. The problem, it claims, is that the application depended on \u201cthe Steele Dossier,\u201d a document put together by former British spy Christopher Steele alleging deep ties between Trump and Russia (it\u2019s the source of, among other things, the \u201cpee tape\u201d rumors about Trump and Moscow prostitutes).\nThe Steele Dossier, Nunes alleges, \u201cformed an essential part of the Carter Page application,\u201d and Nunes goes on to suggest that the application omitted several key facts about the Steele Dossier that undermine its credibility: Most notably that the dossier was partially funded by the Democratic National Committee and that Steele himself has expressed his opposition to Donald Trump becoming president.\nWe can\u2019t check whether these claims are true without seeing the actual FISA application. It could be that the Steele Dossier wasn\u2019t very important to the Page application, or that the FBI actually did disclose Steele\u2019s political connections. (This is apparently the argument in a Democratic counter-memo, which was not published because Republicans voted to keep it secret.\nThe Nunes memo, in other words, could be full of lies. We just can\u2019t tell based on reading it.\nBut let\u2019s assume that its core factual assertions \u2014 the FBI heavily relied on the Steele Dossier, and that it didn\u2019t mention his funding sources in the FISA warrant \u2014 are true. So what?\nThe FBI relies on sources with axes to grind all the time. People typically don\u2019t go to the authorities with damaging information about people they like. The key questions in an application like this isn\u2019t whether the source liked the target; it\u2019s whether the specific claims they\u2019re making are credible.\nThe memo doesn\u2019t do make that case.\n\u201cWhat matters is whether the Steele specific findings *actually material to the application* were unverified,\u201d Julian Sanchez, an expert on surveillance at the libertarian Cato Institute, wrote after reading the memo. \u201cMemo doesn\u2019t seem to make that claim.\u201d\nThe memo insinuates a lot \u2014 and proves virtually nothing\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThis fits with the memo\u2019s overall method of argument, which is to imply something suspicious without outright asserting malfeasance.\nFor example, the memo repeatedly notes that the DOJ knew that \u201cpolitical actors\u201d were involved in the financing the Steele Dossier. It implies that the FBI knew they were Democrats and chose to ignore it.\nBut it never outright asserts that, and for good reason. The firm that employed Steele was initially contracted by a conservative publication, the Washington Free Beacon, not any Democrat or Democratic political campaign. It\u2019s possible the FBI knew of the Free Beacon\u2019s involvement or just generally that some political actor was involved in funding it \u2014 but didn\u2019t know about the Clinton campaign\u2019s involvement. The memo never clarifies which \u201cpolitical actors\u201d it means.\nSimilarly, the memo notes that various important people, including former FBI Director James Comey and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, reapproved the FISA surveillance after the initial application. The implication is that these people were either incompetent, because they failed to notice the omissions in the application, or complicit in an effort to deceive the court.\nBut there\u2019s another possibility that\u2019s left unmentioned: Perhaps the FISA surveillance on Page revealed disturbing Russian connections that warranted continued surveillance. Page had a longtime history of connections with the Russian government\u2014 so much so that in 2013, Russian agents approached him with the intent of turning him into an asset (a point the Nunes memo never notes).\nThis, experts say, is almost certainly what happened.\n\u201cIt\u2019s reapproved if you have new information justifying the original probable cause and the government\u2019s need to listen,\u201d writes Asha Rangappa, a former FBI special agent and current Yale Law professor. \u201cKind of the point of requiring the extension. Sounds like the gov [made] its burden not once, but THREE times.\u201d\nAnd ... that\u2019s it, really. \nThe memo doesn\u2019t prove its core claim, that there were real omissions in the FISA application related to the Steele Dossier \u2014 it merely asserts them. Nor does it contain any evidence that these omissions, if they were made intentionally, undermine the validity of the FISA warrant. There\u2019s just no there there.\n\u201cIf this is their evidence of \u2018Worse than Watergate,\u2019 it\u2019s thin,\u201d Sanchez concludes. \u201cThis reads like something you\u2019d put together to *sound* scandalous to someone who isn\u2019t going to parse it closely.\u201d\nThe memo actually exculpates the Russia investigation\nRepublicans have been selling this memo politically as devastating proof of anti-Trump animus at the FBI\u2019s upper echelons and in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said its content justified a \u201ccleanse\u201d of the FBI.\nIf the memo can\u2019t stand up its specific allegations about the Page FISA application, it clearly can\u2019t stand up an allegation this broad and deep. Some of the pre-release speculation about the memo\u2019s contents, like the notion that it would have embarrassing information about Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, clearly didn\u2019t pan out.\nIn fact, the memo concludes on a note that actually should vindicate the broader Russia investigation.\nThe last paragraph of the memo is all about the FISA application\u2019s references to George Papadopoulos. The Trump campaign foreign-policy advisor also had connections with Russia \u2014 he had been approached by a Russian-linked professor in London in the spring of 2016 who told him the Kremlin had dirt on Hillary Clinton \u2014 and was also under FBI suspicion. \nThe memo admits, crucially, that the Trump-Russia investigation was based in part by Papadopoulos\u2019s misbehavior, not Page\u2019s. \u201cThe Papadopoulos information,\u201d the memo admits, \u201ctriggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016.\u201d\nThe reason this matters is because it shows that, even if the Carter Page FISA application were flawed, the Trump-Russia investigation had another foundation \u2014 evidence about Papadopoulos\u2019s Russian contacts. That means you can\u2019t discredit the entire Russia investigation by pointing to the Page warrant.\nThe memo tries to insinuate that this too was biased against Trump \u2014 noting that one of the FBI agents handling the Papadopoulos situation, Peter Strzok, had sent some text messages critical of Trump to his \u201cmistress,\u201d FBI attorney Lisa Page. \nBut at this point, we know that the information on Papadopoulos was legit \u2014 because he pled guilty to lying to the FBI and gave a ton of information to Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s office. Papadopoulos admitted, among other things, that a Russian-linked professor had told him that the Russians had \u201cthousands\u201d of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. Papadopoulos is a key witness in the Trump-Russia case, and Page hasn\u2019t even been indicted \u2014 suggesting the case indeed rests on solid ground.\nThe Nunes memo, in short, is long on assertions and short on evidence \u2014 and, by the end, it has fatally undermined its own reason for existing, providing political ammunition against the Russia investigation. If the president, House Republicans, or Fox News try to use this as a justification for some kind of purge at the FBI, then you can be sure of one thing: They\u2019re totally disconnected from the facts.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Emily Stewart", "body": "On Friday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, allegedly for misleading investigators about authorizing a conversation between FBI officials and Wall Street Journal reporters in 2016. It was intended to rebut allegations he had slowed down an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. According to the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, McCabe allowed two top FBI officials to speak to reporters; in an internal review afterward, the former deputy director apparently displayed a \u201clack of candor\u201d about the affair, which is a fireable offense at the Bureau \u2014 and which was why Sessions decided to oust him. \n\nThat decision has prompted a number of questions, including whether McCabe\u2019s firing was politically motivated \u2014 or performed at the urging of President Donald Trump \u2014 and why it was done so vindictively, taking place as it did just two days before McCabe would have been eligible to receive a full federal pension after more than 20 years of service. Another question has begun to percolate as well: Should Sessions, who recused himself from all matters related to the 2016 presidential campaign \u2014 which included anything involving the Clinton Foundation \u2014 have been able to fire McCabe at all? \n\nSessions said he\u2019d stay away from all things Clinton Foundation at his confirmation hearing\nWriting at the New York University School of Law-based blog Just Security, Ryan Goodman, a professor of law at New York University, made the argument on Saturday that Sessions violated his promise recuse himself from matters involving the 2016 election \u2014 a decision Trump had been furious about for quite some time. \n\n\u201cSome might contend that Sessions\u2019 recusal covered only the Clinton and Trump campaigns, and that McCabe\u2019s firing involved the Clinton Foundation investigation as a separate matter,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut Sessions unequivocally assured senators of his intentions during his confirmation hearings in response to a clear and specific question from the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA). Sen. Grassley asked a follow-up question that went right to the point. In response, Sessions very clearly said his recusal would cover any matters involving the Clinton Foundation.\u201d\n\nGoodman points specifically to an exchange between Sessions and Grassley during Sessions\u2019 confirmation hearing to become US attorney general. This is the exchange (Goodman\u2019s emphasis in bold):\n\n\nGRASSLEY: During the course of the presidential campaign, you made a number of statements about the investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, relating to her handling of sensitive emails and regarding certain actions of the Clinton Foundation. You weren\u2019t alone in that criticism. I was certainly critical in the same way as were millions of Americans on those matters, but now, you\u2019ve been nominated to serve as attorney general. In light of those comments that you made, some have expressed concerns about whether you can approach the Clinton matter impartially in both fact and appearance. How do you plan to address those concerns?\n\nSESSIONS: Mr. Chairman, it was a highly contentious campaign. I, like a lot of people, made comments about the issues in that campaign. With regard to Secretary Clinton and some of the comments I made, I do believe that that could place me objectivity in question. I\u2019ve given that thought.\n\nI believe the proper thing for me to do, would be to recuse myself from any questions involving those kind of investigations that involve Secretary Clinton and that were raised during the campaign or to be otherwise connected to it.\n\nGRASSLEY: OK. I think, that\u2019s \u2014 let me emphasize then with a follow up question. To be very clear, you intend to recuse yourself from both the Clinton e-mail investigation and any matters involving the Clinton Foundation, if there are any?\n\nSESSIONS: Yes.\n\n\nThat, according to Goodman, is enough to determine that Sessions shouldn\u2019t have fired McCabe, as the former FBI deputy director\u2019s misdeeds were related to the Clinton Foundation. \u201cIf it is a close call whether the Clinton Foundation matter is sufficiently connected to the Clinton campaign for purpose of understanding Sessions\u2019 recusal, it should be deemed to be sufficiently connected. After all, that\u2019s essentially what Sessions told Sen. Grassley,\u201d Goodman writes. \u201cSecond, if the Clinton Foundation matter is deemed outside the scope of the recusal statement that Sessions made back in March last year, then his decision to fire McCabe shows that he failed to honor the promise for a broader recusal which he clearly made to the Senate in its decision to confirm him as Attorney General.\u201d \n\nThis is not the first time Sessions has been accused of violating his recusal pledge. A watchdog group filed a complaint with the Justice Department in May alleging that his participation in the firing of former FBI Director James Comey was a violation of his pledge to recuse himself from matters involving Russia, asking that the department investigate the matter, issue a public report, and take additional action if deemed appropriate. A similar request could presumably be made here, or a Congressional oversight body could take action, but with Republicans in control of the House of Representatives and the Senate, it is unlikely there would be much impetus to do so. \n\nI spoke to legal experts about Sessions\u2019 decision to fire McCabe. Their responses were mixed.\nI asked five legal experts whether they believe Sessions violated his recusal promise by firing McCabe. Some said that he did, while others said they would need more information to decide. \n\nHere are the facts as we know them: McCabe used the FBI press office to authorize a bureau lawyer and spokesperson to speak to the Wall Street Journal for a 2016 story about infighting in the FBI over how to handle investigations into Hillary Clinton, a story that included her use of email as secretary of state and the Clinton Foundation. Specifically, McCabe authorized officials to push back against allegations that he had slowed down an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. As the New York Times notes, the article says that McCabe insisted his agents had the authority to investigate the foundation even if the Justice Department wouldn\u2019t authorize grand jury subpoenas. \n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report on exactly what happened after hasn\u2019t been released, but it reportedly determines McCabe lacked candor with internal investigators when asked about disclosures to the Wall Street Journal. The question about Sessions now is whether the Clinton Foundation tie-in is enough to have forced the Attorney General to recuse himself from dealing with the McCabe affair. \n\nKathleen Clarke, a law professor at Washington University and an expert in ethics, said in an email she agrees with Goodman\u2019s analysis that Sessions did break his recusal promise. \u201cSessions promised to recuse from \u2018any matters involving the Clinton Foundation,\u2019 yet he failed to recuse from the decision of how (if at all) McCabe should be disciplined in connection with the Justice Department\u2019s investigation of the Clinton Foundation,\u201d she said.\n\nDavid Sklansky, a Standford law professor, concurred \u2014 Sessions himself has publicly recognized he can\u2019t be impartial when it comes to Clinton-related matters, which presumably includes the McCabe firing. \u201cIf the basis for firing McCabe has anything to do with actions he took in connection with investigations of either the Clinton Foundation or Secretary Clinton\u2019s email server, then the participation of Attorney General Sessions in the decision does appear to break the promise he made to Congress during his confirmation hearings,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cHe promised to recuse himself from any participation in these investigations, because \u2014 as even Sessions recognized \u2014 there was serious reason to doubt he could be impartial, given the active role he had played in the Trump campaign. And recusal means recusal: it means he has to take himself completely out of the chain of decision.\u201d\n\nCarl Tobias, law professor at the University of Richmond, said the Senate should act. \u201cIf Sessions violated the recusal promise, the [Senate Judiciary Committee] would have to agree to act on that, but the panel may split along party lines,\u201d he said in an email. \n\nMichael Horowitz, the Justice Department\u2019s Inspector General, provided a report to the Department of Justice determining that McCabe made an \u201cunauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor,\u201d according to Sessions\u2019 statement on the decision to fire McCabe, but the report hasn\u2019t been made public yet, making it hard to determine the merits of Sessions\u2019 decision. If the decision was made based not on the Clinton Foundation investigation but instead relates solely to McCabe\u2019s conduct in making misleading comments regarding that investigation, then the argument could be made that he didn\u2019t violate his recusal after all.\n\n\u201cThat would help, so we could see the reasoning behind the firing to see if it is persuasive,\u201d Tobias, from the University of Richmond, said. House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Adam Schiff (D-CA) made a similar observation on Twitter.\n\n\n\nIn the absence of the IG report, it\u2019s impossible to evaluate the merits of this harsh treatment of a 21-year FBI professional. That it comes after the President urged the DOJ to deprive McCabe of his pension, and after his testimony, gives the action an odious taint. https://t.co/rpZqqxFp4u\n\u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) March 17, 2018\n\n\n\n\nMcCabe\u2019s firing could be viewed as an \u201cinternal disciplinary matter\u201d given the inspector general\u2019s findings and the recommendation from the FBI\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility that he be fired, said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University. But Sessions could have stepped aside just in case. \u201cA solid argument could have been made to defer to [Deputy Attorney General] Rod Rosenstein given McCabe\u2019s role on the Russia investigation,\u201d Turley wrote. \u201cHowever, there is a good-faith basis for acting on the question.\u201d\n\nIt is also worth noting that while Sessions said he would recuse himself from anything related to the Clinton Foundation in his exchange with Grassley, his official recusal statement only mentions the 2016 campaign. \u201cThere is a difference in what Mr. Sessions said he would do when testifying before Congress and his official recusal letter,\u201d Andrea Curcio, a law professor at Georgia State University, told me. \n\nThere is plenty that is legally questionable about the decision to fire Sessions, however:  Trump\u2019s sustained attack on McCabe, including on Saturday, and the rushed manner in which the Department of Justice fired McCabe in order to strip him of his pension bring Sessions\u2019 motivations into question. \n\nCurcio, an evidence professor and former litigator, said the timing of McCabe\u2019s firing \u2014 just two days before his pension vests \u2014 could create a showdown if the matter ends up in court. \u201c[It] sets up a great cross examination if McCabe\u2019s testimony is unfavorable to the Trump administration,\u201d she said. \u201cThe loss of his pension as a motivating factor for any unfavorable testimony now becomes fertile ground for a withering cross examination.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matthew Yglesias", "body": "It did not attract a ton of attention at the time (nothing does these days) but about a year ago on February 28, 2017, Congress passed and Donald Trump signed a law revoking an Obama-era regulatory initiative that made it harder for people with mental illness to buy a gun. \nYet despite this effort to roll back even a very modest effort to restrain the ability of seriously incapacitated people from obtaining deadly weapons, this morning Trump tweeted that there were \u201cso many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed,\u201d implying that someone should have done something to report him.\n\n\nSo many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior.

The Obama-era gun regulation wouldn\u2019t have had a massive impact on gun violence in the US since it\u2019s estimated that it would only affect about 75,000 people. And disability rights groups had their own objections to the bill so some liberal groups joined with the National Rifle Association in urging Trump to reverse it.\nBut anything that makes it easier to obtain a gun, the research suggests, will likely worsen gun violence. After all, America already has some of the weakest gun laws in the developed world \u2014 and repealing a rule that made it a little tougher for some people to buy a gun likely makes that worse.\nThe rule tasked the Social Security Administration with turning over information to the FBI\nThe vote was part of a larger suite of Congressional Review Act measures that passed early in the Trump administration. The CRA allows Congress to overrule recently enacted regulatory initiatives passed by the executive branch. CRA bills can\u2019t be filibustered, but they do need to be signed by the president. \nConsequently, the CRA is rarely used since the president isn\u2019t going to sign a measure blocking his own regulations. But in the first year of the Trump administration, the CRA was used to reverse a whole suite of final-year Obama regulations. These reversals mostly made life easier for polluters but also let Internet Service Providers sell your web browsing data to advertisers and made it easier for people with severe mental illness to buy guns.\nSpecifically, what Obama did was order to Social Security Administration to take the list of people who were deemed so severely mentally ill that they are unfit to handle their own disability benefits and forward it to the FBI. The FBI was then supposed to incorporate that list in the background checks used to disqualify people from gun ownership. \nThis is obviously an extremely narrow measure that wouldn\u2019t have had enormous impact one way or the other \u2014 it just represented Obama\u2019s limited capacity to do anything on guns in the face of relentless congressional opposition.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "German Lopez", "body": "For decades, the federal government, with the support of the National Rifle Association, has made it very difficult to answer a question at the heart of American public health and safety: Does gun control work?\n\nThe answer is hugely important given that guns killed nearly 39,000 Americans in 2016 alone. But after research on gun violence in the 1990s found that firearms do not \u2014 contrary to NRA talking points \u2014 make people safer, the group backed a federal funding freeze on gun policy research. \n\nBut studies have gone on \u2014 just without federal funding. And on Friday, a nonpartisan think tank, the RAND Corporation, released the results so far of its Gun Policy in America initiative, a two-year dive into the research on gun violence and the laws trying to curtail it.\n\nRAND\u2019s extensive report does not make any sweeping declarations about gun policy. It does, however, make clear that gun control research is very limited, calling on Congress to lift the NRA-backed funding freeze. It argues that this freeze has, by making it difficult to conduct better studies, led to a confusing empirical environment, where it\u2019s easy for groups on both sides of the debate to cite shoddy work that supports their prior beliefs.\n\n\u201cThe studies that have been done often reach opposite conclusions to each other,\u201d Andrew Morral, the head of RAND\u2019s gun policy initiative, told me. The lack of thorough research, he added, \u201ccreates this kind of fact-free environment in which people can cherry-pick any study that happens to support what their priors are on the effects of the law.\u201d\n\nMorral\u2019s team spent two years reviewing US-based studies published over the past several decades, pulling out the most rigorous to try to find some \u201cincontrovertible truths.\u201d RAND concluded that, first and foremost, far more research is necessary. \u201cMany of the matters that people disagree on when they disagree on gun policy have not been rigorously studied in ways that produce reasonably unambiguous results,\u201d Morral said.\n\nBut there were some things that could be gleaned from the available evidence. While RAND as a nonpartisan group avoided any sweeping policy conclusions in its analysis, its review does seem to point in a direction, based on my own reading: More permissive gun policies lead to more gun deaths, while more restrictive policies lead to fewer gun deaths. Coupled with other evidence in this area, that supports the idea that more guns lead to more gun deaths.\n\nGiven that America is dealing with an immediate gun violence problem, as mass shootings and deaths pile up, the report is worth taking seriously. At the very least, there\u2019s enough evidence to suggest that the federal government should stop refusing to fund research on policies that really could work to save thousands of lives every year.\n\nThe available research points in one direction\nRAND\u2019s report does not come out in favor of more or less gun control. Instead, the team compiled the best research that\u2019s available so far into charts and in-depth evaluations \u2014 the result of a review of dozens of studies, focused on 13 policies and eight outcomes. Here are the overall findings, which only included studies that met RAND\u2019s rigorous standards:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nThe RAND report emphasizes that much of the research on gun policy is still in its infancy. You can see that in the chart above in all the white and gray space \u2014 we still don\u2019t have answers to a lot of important questions when it comes to gun policy, including the effects on defensive gun use, hunting and recreation, and police shootings.\n\nBut the answers we do have point in one direction. On the gun control front, there\u2019s moderate evidence that background checks reduce suicide and violent crime, limited evidence that prohibitions associated with mental illness reduce suicide, moderate evidence that those prohibitions reduce violent crime, and supportive evidence that child-access prevention laws reduce suicides and unintentional injuries and deaths. \n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s limited evidence that concealed carry laws increase violent crime and unintentional injuries and deaths. And there\u2019s moderate evidence that \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws \u2014 NRA-backed measures that expand when someone can use a gun or other weapons to defend himself \u2014 increase violent crime.\n\nIf you put this all together, it suggests that restrictive laws seem to lead to fewer gun deaths, while the permissive laws seem to lead to more gun deaths.\n\nThat\u2019s not enough for nonpartisan researchers at RAND to make sweeping conclusions, but it\u2019s certainly suggestive \u2014 particularly for policymakers interested in finding solutions to America\u2019s gun violence problem as soon as possible.\n\nStill, the research is far from ideal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to claim a general truth from this yet,\u201d Morral said. \u201cThere\u2019s been so little research that we\u2019re really at the mercy of a few studies. If we could fill every cell in the empty table that we put up, I don\u2019t know if we would see the same thing. But it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out here that RAND\u2019s standards are fairly high. For example, it deemed an oft-cited study from Missouri \u201cinconclusive.\u201d That study found that when Missouri repealed its handgun licensing law in 2007, firearm homicides \u2014 but not other types of homicides \u2014 rose significantly. That certainly suggests that the law led to an immediate increase in homicides.\n\nBut RAND\u2019s team was more cautious. For one, Missouri also passed its \u201cstand your ground\u201d law in 2007. Could that explain the rise in homicides, given the evidence that \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws increase violent crime? RAND\u2019s team wasn\u2019t convinced that the Missouri study completely ruled that out, given some of its methodological limitations.\n\nRAND also excluded foreign studies in its official synthesis (although it did include a few foreign studies in brief essays). Some of these studies have compelling evidence for gun restrictions, but RAND\u2019s team argued that the US is too unusual for those other findings to cleanly apply.\n\nAnother major area of limitation was the way the science itself was done. Studies try to find what\u2019s known as statistical significance \u2014 essentially, an effect that\u2019s large enough that it\u2019s unlikely to be just a statistical anomaly. Because of this, it can be difficult to find small effects in a scientifically reliable manner. \n\nAnd in gun policy, a small effect could actually be huge, RAND noted: \u201cFor example, a 3-percent reduction in firearm deaths corresponds to 1,000 fewer deaths per year nationally.\u201d\n\nThis problem could be overcome with better, more rigorous research. But because the studies were often dealing with limited data and methodologies, many of them couldn\u2019t work through these problems.\n\nOverall, the research that RAND included in its analysis \u2014 and deemed reliable \u2014 just did not answer many questions to the team\u2019s satisfaction, even if the evidence appears suggestive to you or me.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say RAND itself made no conclusions. The think tank found supportive evidence for child access prevention laws reducing suicide and unintentional injuries and deaths. And Morral agreed that the evidence is stronger on background checks and prohibitions associated with mental illness than other gun policies.\n\nBut Morral and RAND weren\u2019t comfortable reaching the conclusions that I\u2019ve made after seeing their findings.\n\nExperts on both sides are split on key issues\nUnsatisfied with the state of the research, RAND tried to find other sources for answers. So it turned to gun policy experts.\n\n\u201cGiven that there\u2019s a fair amount that\u2019s not been studied but matters in these gun policy debates, we believed that policymakers and the public tend to turn to experts \u2014 researchers, but also policy analysts at advocacy organizations,\u201d Morral said. \u201cAnd so we wanted to understand, in the absence of a real consensus around lots of the potential effects of these policies, what do the experts from these two different sides believe those effects are?\u201d\n\nRAND surveyed experts about 15 policies, splitting them into two camps: those who support more restrictive gun policies, and those who support more permissive policies. The full results are available over at RAND\u2019s website, which compiled them into interactive maps.\n\nHere are the survey\u2019s overall findings for firearm homicides:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nThere\u2019s some obvious disagreement here. Those in the more restrictive camp said that restrictive policies would reduce homicides and more permissive measures would have the opposite effect. Those on the more permissive side said that restrictive policies would have little to no effect, while permissive policies would reduce homicides.\n\nAnd if you implemented all 15 policies included in the survey, both sides said that gun homicides would fall.\n\nOne caveat to the survey results: \u201cThese are really back-of-the-envelope calculations,\u201d Morral said. So the exact percentages in the maps should not be taken too literally, but the general trends do at least give some guidance for where experts land on these issues.\n\nThere were some big points of agreement: Both sides agreed on the effects of forcing prohibited possessors to give up firearms, expanded mental health prohibitions, and a child access prevention media campaign, concluding that such measures would reduce gun deaths overall.\n\nAnother point of agreement: gun suicides, which killed 59 percent more people in the US than gun homicides in 2016. Both sides said, on average, that more restrictive gun policies would reduce firearm suicides \u2014 saving at least thousands of lives annually.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nThe survey also exposed why the different sides disagree on these issues. According to RAND, it\u2019s not that both sides have totally different values \u2014 that the permissive side, for example, believes that gun rights are important even if they increase firearm homicides. \n\nInstead, both sides generally agree that the top concerns are public health and safety outcomes. It\u2019s just that they disagree on which policies are more effective at doing that \u2014 the permissive side genuinely believes that more permissive gun policies could save lives, while the more restrictive side genuinely believes that more restrictive policies could save lives.\n\nOne reason for the difference may be conflicting beliefs about what RAND characterized as a substitution effect. The report explained: \n\nThe median respondent with more-permissive regulatory preferences indicated that if a policy successfully reduced a state\u2019s firearm suicides, 90 percent of the prevented suicides would still end as a suicide by some other means. In contrast, the median respondent with more-restrictive regulatory preferences responded that 20 percent would still end as a suicide. They produced the same stark differences in expected substitution of means for firearm homicides: 90 percent for those favoring permissive policies, and 20 percent for those favoring restrictive policies. Those who favor permissive policies view reductions of firearm suicides and homicides as largely futile efforts because these outcomes will continue, largely uninhibited, through other means. \n\nThere is some evidence for the more restrictive side here. Consider suicide: It tends to be fairly impulsive, with people often deciding to kill themselves and acting on it within hours. But if they don\u2019t have a gun around, maybe they\u2019ll give up on it altogether. Or if they reach for other means, those are simply going to be much less deadly than a firearm \u2014 while the death rate of suicide attempts with guns is above 90 percent, the death rate with other means can drop to below 10 percent.\n\nRegardless, disagreement over the substitution effect helps explain why smart people on both sides can have such different views on gun policy.\n\nMore guns, more gun deaths?\nOutside of RAND\u2019s research, there has been a lot of evidence that there is a correlation between the availability of guns and more gun deaths.\n\nThe research, compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health\u2019s Injury Control Research Center, is pretty clear: After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths.\n\n\u201cWithin the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide,\u201d David Hemenway, the Injury Control Research Center\u2019s director, wrote in Private Guns, Public Health.\n\nFor example, a 2013 study, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, found that, after controlling for multiple variables, a 1 percent increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate at the state level.\n\nThis chart, based on data from researcher Josh Tewksbury, shows the correlation between the number of guns and gun deaths among wealthier nations, demonstrating that the US in particular has way more guns and gun deaths than its developed peers:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nThere\u2019s good reason to believe, too, that guns are to blame here. As a breakthrough analysis by UC Berkeley\u2019s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins in 1999 found, it\u2019s not even that the US has more crime than other developed countries. This chart, based on data from Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University, shows that the US is not an outlier when it comes to overall crime:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nInstead, the US appears to have more lethal violence \u2014 and that\u2019s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns.\n\n\u201dA series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,\u201d Zimring and Hawkins wrote. \u201cA preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nThis is in many ways intuitive: People of every country get into arguments and fights with friends, family, and peers. But in the US, it\u2019s much more likely that someone will get angry at an argument and be able to pull out a gun and kill someone.\n\nRAND takes a more skeptical view. The report argued that it can be hard to disentangle the relationship between more guns and more gun deaths: Is it the abundance of guns leading to more gun deaths, or are people seeing a lot of violence in their communities and reacting to it by stocking up on guns to protect themselves? RAND concluded that there\u2019s just not enough in the research it reviewed to solve this chicken-or-egg scenario.\n\nStill, when RAND\u2019s findings are coupled with other studies we have, there\u2019s some suggestive evidence that easy access to guns is the cause here.\n\nTake the research on gun control measures more broadly, including the foreign studies that RAND left out. A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries published in Epidemiologic Reviews, for example, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence. That\u2019s a very strong indicator that it\u2019s the guns that are causing the deaths, since restrictions on guns were followed by a drop in violence. And it comes from very big, reliable meta-analysis.\n\nBut as RAND points out, things are less clear when trying to gauge how well specific policies would work in more exact terms, particularly in a US context.\n\nAmerica has a ton of guns \u2014 by far more than any other country in the world; it\u2019s an open question how you go about reducing or restricting a stockpile so large. \n\nWould people react violently to a mandatory buyback program similar to the one Australia used to confiscate guns? Would a universal background check system have a big impact, given that people could potentially get around it in the underground markets by simply trading the many firearms already in circulation? If America required licensing and registration for guns, how would it ensure that people who already own weapons get the proper license and registration filed?\n\nThe research \u2014 including some of RAND\u2019s findings \u2014 suggests that these three policies would likely reduce gun deaths to some extent. The question is just how big the effect would be and which policies would be the most effective \u2014 a very important question if the US is ever going to bring gun violence down to European levels.\n\nWe need more research\nAll of that is to say that more research is needed. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so bad that the federal government, typically a major facilitator of studies, has for decades refused to fund the research.\n\nStateline staff writer Michael Ollove, citing a recent study in JAMA, summarized the problem: \u201cThe study said that gun violence research received a paltry 1.6 percent of the [federal] funding ($22 million) that would be predicted ($1.4 billion) based on the number of deaths caused by guns \u2014 36,252 in 2015, according to the CDC.\u201d\n\nIn the absence of the federal government, RAND is stepping in to try to help out researchers. It put up a database of gun laws, which it hopes will help researchers conduct more accurate analyses of the effects of such laws. It also put out a lengthy, wonky set of recommendations for improving the methodology of research into this area. (Be warned: Unless you\u2019re a statistician or pretty familiar with statistics, much of it will go over your head.)\n\nThis all goes to addressing one of the key problems with the lack of federal funding: Since it can be difficult to get money for gun research, it\u2019s hard to build up correct data sets and thorough methodologies when conducting studies. After all, these are things that are not only time-consuming but financially costly as well \u2014 it\u2019s not cheap to run big surveys across the country.\n\n\u201cWe have not been collecting some of the right data to do these analyses well,\u201d Morral said. So researchers often rely on limited data just because it\u2019s what\u2019s available.\n\nAs an example: Several studies looking at the effects of concealed carry permits looked at firearm homicides in general. But what a researcher should ideally want to look at in this area is the effect of firearm homicides outside the home, since that\u2019s where people really use those permits. The data, however, often can\u2019t be broken up like that.\n\nFederal funding could go to surveys and on-the-ground research that could help address the gaps.\n\nThe funding is something, however, that pro-gun groups like the NRA have worked against for years. And so far, their tactics have worked \u2014 keeping the federal freeze in place. So although there\u2019s evidence that some gun control measures could work, we by and large remain blind to what specific solutions would work best and what all of their effects would be.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jane Coaston", "body": "After President Trump signed a massive 2,323-page omnibus spending bill on Friday \u2014 one which conservative publications deemed \u201can embarrassment and a disgrace\u201d and Trump had initially threatened to veto \u2014 many conservative pundits, including some of Trump\u2019s biggest fans, were incensed. \n\nThe bill gives a big boost to military funding (a major conservative point of emphasis), but it doesn\u2019t defund Planned Parenthood \u2014 a longtime GOP promise \u2014 and adds roughly $1 trillion to the deficit.

He told me that Trump\u2019s current problems are the same many ones conservatives pointed out during the 2016 primaries: \u201cHe\u2019s not a detail guy and he\u2019s not a spending hawk. He went out there [during the election] promising people that he\u2019s not going to cut entitlements,\u201d making it unlikely that Trump would then sign off on massive cuts to government spending. \u201cOne of the key objections to Donald Trump is that he\u2019s got that inner Democrat. [Cutting spending] just doesn\u2019t occur to him.\u201d\n\nKlavan added that much of the blame for the omnibus should go on the Republican Party. \u201cI think that the GOP is so punch drunk from the media slapping them around that they just allow [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer and [House Minority Leader Nancy] Pelosi to just walk all over them, and Trump is not the guy who is paying attention.\u201d \n\nSchumer\u2019s communications director, Matt House, seemed to agree: \n\n\n\nI, for one, am tired of all the winning.\n\u2014 Matt House (@mattwhouse) March 23, 2018", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matthew Yglesias", "body": "Democrat Margaret Good defeated Republican James Buchanan by a 52-45 margin in a special election for Florida House District 72, marking the 36th state legislative seat Democrats have flipped in a special election since Donald Trump\u2019s election.\nTrump carried the district by a 51-46 margin so this isn\u2019t a huge upset, but it does continue a pattern of downballot Democratic candidates performing substantially better in 2017 and 2018 than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. The win also doesn\u2019t do anything to meaningfully alter the balance of power in Tallahassee, which remains heavily tilted toward the GOP, but it suggests that the national political environment continues to be favorable to Democrats as they look ahead to the midterms in November \u2014 with Florida serving as a state where they\u2019re looking to pick up a couple of House seats and ideally the governor\u2019s mansion, which would give them a voice in the next redistricting process. \nVote totals are not yet available for two other special elections being held tonight, both in much redder districts in Georgia and Oklahoma, where the odds of a GOP win are overwhelming.\nLong story short, despite Trump\u2019s somewhat improved poll numbers he remains historically unpopular for a president in his second term and Republicans are paying the price at the polls.\nDemocrats are cleaning up in special elections\nAccording to an extremely useful comprehensive spreadsheet compiled by Daily Kos, across 70 special elections in 2017, Democrats ran 10 points ahead of Clinton and 7 points ahead of Obama\u2019s 2012 results. Those numbers have accelerated into 2018. Across 12 races, Democrats are running 23 points ahead of Clinton and 8 points ahead of Obama. \nHistorically speaking, special election results usually are somewhat predictive of midterm general election outcomes, though I don\u2019t think anyone believes it\u2019s realistic for Democrats to obtain a nationwide 23-point swing relative to Clinton\u2019s numbers. \nMeanwhile, the special elections are already having real-world impact. \nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has decided to leave a number of formerly GOP-held seats vacant rather than schedule special elections his party might lose, national Republicans are pushing the panic button on an upcoming special House election in Pennsylvania, and GOP leadership is letting scandal-plagued Rep. Blake Farenthold stick around in his seat rather than risk a special election.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Dara Lind", "body": "The Trump administration is working on new rules that would allow the government to keep immigrants from settling in the US, or even force them to leave, if their families had used a broad swath of local, state or federal social services to which they\u2019re legally entitled \u2014 even enrolling their US-born children in Head Start or state Children\u2019s Health Insurance Programs (CHIP).\nA draft of the new regulation, posted first by Vox, can be found at the bottom of this article or on DocumentCloud. Reuters originally reported on the existence of the draft regulation Thursday.\nThe rule wouldn\u2019t make it illegal for immigrants to use public services that are open to everyone regardless of immigration status, or that are available to their US-born children. But it would make it possible for the government to deny their applications for a new type of visa, or a green card, if they\u2019d used those services. In other words, it could force them to choose between taking advantage of available social services, and their family\u2019s future ability to stay in the United States permanently.\nIf approved and finalized, the regulation would vastly expand the federal government\u2019s power to bar an immigrant from entering the United States, obtaining a new visa, or becoming a lawful permanent resident (green-card holder) by labeling the immigrant a likely \u201cpublic charge.\u201d\nRight now, the government can only consider use of cash benefits, like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, in \u201cpublic charge\u201d determinations. The Trump administration wants to give officials the power to look at use of other benefits as well, including: \n\nsome \u201ceducational benefits,\u201d including use of Head Start for children\nChildren\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)\nuse of any subsidies, or purchase of subsidized insurance, under the Affordable Care Act\nfood stamps\nWomen, Infants and Children (WIC) assistance\nHousing benefits, like Section 8\nLow-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)\ntransit vouchers\n\nUsing any of these for more than 6 months in the last two years (before applying for a different visa or a green card) would be considered a \u201cheavily weighted\u201d strike against the immigrant. (That strike could be canceled out if an immigrant was making more than 250 percent of the federal poverty level when applying for the new visa or green card \u2014 which, for a family of 4 in 2017, was $60,750.)\nGovernment officials already have a lot of discretion in who gets labeled a public charge, and use of public services is supposed to be only one factor among many. But the Trump administration\u2019s desire to expand it so radically indicates that they do, in fact, plan to reject visa or green card applications based on use of non-cash services and health insurance subsidies.\nImmigrants can get out of being considered a \u201cpublic charge\u201d if they have someone willing to sign an \u201caffidavit of support\u201d promising to support them at 125 percent of the federal poverty level. But the government doesn\u2019t have to agree to admit someone, or give them a green card, based on that affidavit.\nThe draft would allow an immigrant one other way to get out of a \u201cpublic charge\u201d bar: paying at least $10,000 in bond. But the Department of Homeland Security would have the power to decide whether to allow an immigrant to post bond. And if the immigrant used any public benefits in the five years after posting the bond, she\u2019d forfeit the whole $10,000.\nNot every immigrant has to pass the \u201cpublic charge\u201d test \u2014 refugees and asylees, for example, are exempt both when they come to the US and if they apply for green cards after that. But most immigrants who get green cards do have to pass. According to calculations from Reuters, nearly 383,000 of the immigrants who got green cards in 2016 were subject to the test.\nThe version Vox obtained, dated February 6, was circulated to Department of Homeland Security employees. The document as obtained by Vox includes pages 1-2 of the document, and the regulatory text (starting at page 228); it does not include the 225-page preamble originally included with the draft. \nIt has not yet been approved by L. Francis Cissna, the director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (which regulates legal immigration to the United States).

Republicans hold a 51-49 majority in the United States Senate, and even if two or three moderates could be tempted to cross the aisle and endorse a modest gun control measure, as Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) and a couple of others did in 2013 in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting, you\u2019d need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, which is very hard. \nBut even if you did overcome a filibuster, even a bill that had majority support in the US House of Representatives wouldn\u2019t come to the floor for a vote because of the \u201cHastert Rule\u201d principle. Only bills that are supported by a majority of House Republicans get a vote. And you can\u2019t question the courage of GOP convictions here. The House Republican caucus was itself victimized by a shooter last year in an incident that severely injured Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA), but that did nothing to alter Republicans\u2019 sincere belief that an abnormally high level of gun deaths is a price worth paying for strong gun rights. \nAnd then, of course, there\u2019s President Trump, who has an unusually close relationship with the National Rifle Association (despite his previous calls for an assault weapons ban) even by the standards of GOP presidents, because the group was one of the main pillars of the institutional Republican Party that stood by him even in the lowest moments of his 2016 presidential campaign. Indeed, the NRA is so firmly aligned with Trump that the FBI is now even looking into whether it was used as a cutout through which Russian money was sent to the Trump campaign.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Emily Stewart", "body": "If Saturday evening was any indication, we\u2019re in for many bonkers Trump rallies ahead of the 2018 and 2020 elections. Speaking for more than an hour to a crowd in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, President Donald Trump described newly announced tariffs his \u201cbaby,\u201d discussed executing drug dealers, described an NBC journalist as a \u201csleeping son of a bitch,\u201d and called a black congresswoman \u201clow IQ.\u201d \n\nTrump was in town to support Republican Rick Saccone, who is running against Democrat Conor Lamb to represent Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District in a special election slated for Tuesday. The seat was held by former Rep. Tim Murphy (R-PA), who resigned in October amid revelations that he had pressured a woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair to have an abortion. The race is unexpectedly tight.\n\nTrump endorsed Saccone early on in his speech before returning to the persona that became so familiar in the 2016 election \u2014 that of the unscripted, self-congratulatory candidate eager to rile up a crowd. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, this got us elected,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I came like a stiff, you guys wouldn\u2019t come here tonight.\u201d\n\nTrump brought up many of his favorite topics and insults during the freewheeling speech: He called Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) \u201cPocahontas,\u201d which some say is racist, bragged about his 2016 victory, and attacked the press. He also mentioned some relatively new items, which included a call to execute drug dealers. For the first time, however, President Trump publicly unveiled his 2020 campaign slogan: Keep America Great! \n\nHere\u2019s everything else you might have missed. \n\nTrump called for drug dealers to be executed\nEarlier this month at a White House summit on opioids, the president floated the idea of giving drug dealers the death penalty; on Saturday evening he brought it up again, which got some of the most enthusiastic cheers of the night. Drawing inspiration from China and Singapore \u2014 which he said have a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy and are extremely tough on drugs \u2014 Trump said drug dealers in the US should face harsher penalties than they do now. \n\n\u201dThey shoot one person, kill some person, knife one person, the person dies, they get maybe the death penalty or maybe life in prison, no parole, right? Okay? A drug dealer will kill 2,000, 3,000, 5,000 people during the course of his or her life,\u201d Trump said. He declared that the \u201conly way to solve a drug problem is through toughness.\u201d\n\nTrump, having already made America great, now wants to keep it that way\nTrump, in his characteristically elliptical way, announced his 2020 campaign slogan by first explaining why he can\u2019t use the 2016 slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d \u2014 because \u201cI already did that.\u201d It\u2019s now \u201cKeep America Great!\u201d (Which includes the exclamation point.) \n\nTrump exaggerated how many women voted for him \u2014 and he only counts white women\nAt his rally, Trump claimed that a majority of women voted for him in the 2016 election, but that\u2019s not true. \u201cWomen! We love you! We love you. Hey, didn\u2019t we surprise them with women during the election? Remember? \u2018Women won\u2019t like Donald Trump.\u2019 I said, have I really had that kind of a problem? I don\u2019t think so. But, \u2018Women won\u2019t like Donald Trump. It will be a rough night for Donald Trump because the women won\u2019t come out.\u2019 We got 52 percent, right? 52,\u201d he said.\n\nExcept he didn\u2019t get 52 percent of the total women\u2019s vote \u2013 he got 41 percent, the Associated Press pointed out. He got 52 percent of the vote from white women; only 4 percent of black women voted for him, while 25 percent of Hispanic women chose him at the ballot box.\n\nTrump had a bone to pick with NBC and, specifically, Chuck Todd\nTrump, per usual, spent much of his rally assailing the media and \u201cfake news.\u201d But he appeared to be particularly annoyed with NBC News, which he said is \u201cperhaps worse than CNN\u201d \u2014 which is, by the president\u2019s standards, a major insult.\n\nThe President specifically called out NBC News anchor and Meet the Press host Chuck Todd while describing a media appearance that took place nearly 20 years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s 1999, I\u2019m on Meet the Press, a show now headed by sleepy eyes Chuck Todd,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s a sleeping son of a bitch. I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\n\nHe hurled the same \u201dsleepy eyes\u201d insult at Todd on Twitter in April 2017. In September last year, he called former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick a \u201cson of a bitch\u201d as well.\n\nTodd responded in jest on Twitter soon after Trump\u2019s remarks, reminding viewers to set their clocks for Daylight Saving Time \u201cbefore your eyes get too sleepy.\u201d\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t miss @MeetThePress tomorrow! I know folks may be tired in the morning due to springing forward, so set those clocks and DVRs now before your eyes get too sleepy.\n\u2014 Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) March 11, 2018\n\n\n\n\nTrump celebrates women\u2019s history month with attacks on women\nThe president didn\u2019t mince his words when it came to a number of high-profile women he perceives as his enemies. \n\nTrump\u2019s slander of Senator Warren, who is speculated to be a contender in the 2020 presidential election, invoked a typical misogynist trope \u2014 he characterized her as an angry woman. \u201cYou know, I was watching, during the campaign, and Hillary [Clinton] was sitting right there, and Pocahontas was up, she was so angry, you know, I think she\u2019s losing the audience,\u201d Trump said. \n\nTrump also went after Oprah Winfrey, presumably because there\u2019s buzz that the billionaire TV personality might be interested in a presidential bid. \u201cOh, I\u2019d love Oprah to win,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019d love to beat Oprah. I know her weakness.\u201d He said a campaign would be a \u201cpainful experience\u201d for her.\n\nTrump also mocked Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) as \u201cvery low IQ.\u201d He made similar remarks at the annual Gridiron Club dinner in Washington, DC this month.\n\nTrump did have some nice things to say about particular women on Saturday. He took credit for Representative Karen Handel\u2019s (R-GA) victory in the 2017 Georgia special election against Democrat Jon Ossoff, even though Handel kept him at arm\u2019s length during the race. And he complimented his wife Melania for being a \u201cgreat\u201d first lady. \u201cYou think her life is so easy, folks? Not so easy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe other stuff!\n\nTrump, who has been president for more than a year, mocked the idea of acting \u201cpresidential\u201d and how boring it would be. He performed a quick bit as an example, marching around stage and speaking in a low, slow tone. \u201cThat\u2019s much easier than doing what I have to do,\u201d he said. \nThe president called Saccone \u201chandsome\u201d and his opponent \u201cLamb the sham.\u201d \nTrump took credit for the recent Winter Olympics, which he said \u201cwould have been a total failure\u201d without him. \nTrump said CNN is \u201cfake as hell.\u201d \nThe president claimed to have rejected a request from Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto to say Mexico wouldn\u2019t pay for the proposed border wall. \u201cHe said, \u2018Mr. President, I would like you to make a statement that Mexico will not pay for the wall.\u2019 I said, \u2018Are you crazy? I am not making that statement,\u2019\u201d Trump recounted. When they couldn\u2019t agree, Trump said he told Pe\u00f1a Nieto, \u201cBye, bye. There is no way I\u2019m making that deal.\u201d \nHe touted his recently enacted tariffs, saying they\u2019re his \u201cbaby.\u201d \n\nThe 2018 midterms are coming up quickly, and the 2020 presidential campaign will be here before you know it. Saturday was a preview of what\u2019s likely ahead in the coming months as Trump returns to the campaign trail, where he so likes to be.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Sunday sat down for an interview with NBC\u2019s Todd that came just after Trump\u2019s son-of-a-bitch comments. When asked about the president\u2019s remarks about various people, Mnuchin attempted to distance himself and the White House from campaign trail Trump.  \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s using these vulgarities in the context of a campaign rally and obviously there were a lot of funny moments on, on, on that rally,\u201d Mnuchin said.\n\n\u201cYeah, they were hilarious,\u201d Todd shot back.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matthew Yglesias", "body": "No State of the Union response speech has ever been a truly great speech, but Joe Kennedy III delivered what\u2019s probably the best entry in the genre that I\u2019ve ever heard Tuesday night. \nI couldn\u2019t put my finger on exactly what I liked best about it until I read an anonymous Republican snarking about it. \n\n\nA GOP source texts: \"As a Republican I love how at the end of the day, after all their years of crap about identity politics...Democrats picked a white dude from one of the most privileged families in America to do the response.\"\u2014 Jonathan Swan (@jonathanvswan) January 31, 2018\n\n\n\nKennedy\u2019s speech was about how Americans are all in it together and should reject the false choices and inherent elitism of Donald Trump\u2019s divisive politics. \nBecause here\u2019s the thing \u2014 what liberals do in America, at their best, is not identity politics at all. Identity politics is what Donald Trump does. Identity politics is delivering a speech that offers no solutions for any actual problems in people\u2019s lives, interspersed with dog-whistles about MS-13 and standing for the national anthem. \nRepublicans understand the remorseless mathematical logic of having a white guy stand up and deliver a speech about how whiteness is the best and then wrap it up with a bunch of white members of congress lustily chanting \u201cUSA!\u201d \nThe progressive counter, as delivered by Kennedy Tuesday night and by many other orators over the past 250 years or so, is that America is about equality. \n\u201cThis administration isn\u2019t just targeting the laws that protect us,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThey\u2019re targeting the very idea that we are all worthy of protection. For them, dignity isn\u2019t something you\u2019re born with, but something you measure by your net worth, your celebrity, your headlines, your crowd size.\u201d\nThen he slipped into the identity issues, calling out specific reasons Trump might slot you into something other than first class citizenship before wrapping up \u201ctheir record is rebuke to our highest American ideal, the belief that we are all worthy, that we are all equal, that we all count in the eyes of our law and our leaders, our god, and our government. That is the American promise.\u201d\nAbraham Lincoln, writing in 1855 about the anti-immigrant movement of his day, struck a fundamentally similar tone:\nOur progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation, we began by declaring that \u201dall men are created equal.\u201d We now practically read it \u201call men are created equal, except negroes\u201d When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read \u201call men are created equal, except negroes, and foreigners, and Catholics.\u201d When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty -- to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocricy.\nMore recently, Barack Obama launched his political stardom with the argument that \u201cthere\u2019s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there\u2019s the United States of America\u201d and referred to \u201cthe hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a millworker\u2019s son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know that Kennedy will run for president or whether if he did he\u2019d be a good candidate or a good president. But he did give a good speech precisely because he, like Obama and Lincoln before him, refused to be baited by the Donald Trumps of the world into accepting a vision of a segmented America.\nTrump\u2019s game is to pit people against each other and get them so caught up in their internecine status games that they don\u2019t notice the wholesale looting of America that\u2019s taking place under his administration. My general view is that it will, in fact, probably be easier for black and Latino politicians to make this argument than for white Democrats who can sometimes struggle with trying to convey the fundamental unity of American interests without scanting the significance of particular identities. But Kennedy \u2014 who is surely no more unaware of the broad irony of his situation than any of the other various Kennedy politicians across the past three generations \u2014 just went for it, it was a good idea, and it worked.  \nGOP sources are texting snark about it, because the honest truth is they have no idea how to appeal to a diverse electorate.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Emily Stewart", "body": "President Donald Trump is finally weighing in on the Stormy Daniels saga.

An attorney for Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, slammed the president\u2019s team for pursuing such an enormous amount from a private citizen over \u201cbogus\u201d damages in a maneuver that is \u201clikely unprecedented in our history.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s lawyers filed two motions on Friday in the United States District Court in California, where Daniels sued to get out of a nondisclosure agreement to stay quiet about her affair with Trump ahead of the election. One of the motions is filed on Trump\u2019s behalf and mentions him directly. \u201cMr. Trump intends to pursue his rights to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d it reads. Until now, Trump has tried to keep his distance from the Daniels saga, instead leaving it to his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to deal with. Cohen has claimed he paid Daniels $130,000 with his own personal money.\n\nBut as the story continues to move closer to Trump\u2019s orbit, Trump himself has had no choice but to get involved. The Wall Street Journal reported that a Trump Organization attorney was listed on confidential arbitration documents that included the restraining order against Daniels. And Daniels is likely to appear on 60 Minutes next Sunday.\n\nTrump will be represented in his case against Daniels by Charles Harder, who is best known for representing Hulk Hogan in the sex tape case that ultimately brought website Gawker down. Harder previously represented Melania Trump in a defamation case against the Daily Mail. \n\nMichael Avenatti, a lawyer representing Daniels, slammed Friday\u2019s filings as a \u201cbullying tactic\u201d from the president and Cohen. He said their attempts to move the case from the state court in Los Angeles where Daniels filed her claim to a federal court is because that would increase the chances the matter be decided in private arbitration, \u201cthus hiding the truth from the public.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe filing today is yet another bullying tactic from the president and Mr. Cohen.

Vox\u2019s Jen Kirby on Friday wrapped up the latest in Stormy Daniels news, which beyond the $20 million lawsuit includes the Trump Organization\u2019s ties to efforts to keep Daniels from talking, efforts by BuzzFeed to leverage a separate lawsuit against it to get Daniels to talk, and her tentative impending appearance on 60 Minutes on March 25. Per Kirby: \n\nThis week\u2019s news is more evidence that the Daniels story, first reported in January, won\u2019t die quietly. The latest developments continue to raise serious questions as to whether the $130,000 Daniels (real name Stephanie Clifford) received in hush money just days before the presidential election is an illegal campaign payment. \n\nWhile Trump has weighed in on the matter in court filings, he has not commented on it publicly otherwise. It hasn\u2019t showed up on his Twitter feed \u2014 yet.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "German Lopez", "body": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions just sent out a memo asking federal prosecutors to pursue the death penalty in drug trafficking cases \u2014 implementing President Donald Trump\u2019s plan from earlier this week to ramp up \u201ctough on crime\u201d punishments in response to the opioid epidemic.\n\nHere\u2019s the memo, which in part asks prosecutors to pursue capital punishment in cases \u201cdealing in extremely large quantities of drugs\u201d:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        US Department of Justice\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nSessions can ask federal prosecutors to do this under a law signed by President Bill Clinton in 1994, when fears of crack cocaine and crime led to increasingly punitive criminal justice policies. \n\nThe 1994 provision, however, has never been used to execute drug traffickers. In fact, the federal government has not executed anyone in 15 years.\n\nTrump and Sessions seem intent on changing that. Trump made the case at a rally earlier this month: \u201cIf you shoot one person, they give you life, they give you the death penalty. These [drug traffickers] can kill 2,000, 3,000 people and nothing happens to them.\u201d\n\nThe White House has also asked Congress to reduce the threshold required to impose mandatory minimum sentences for trafficking illicit fentanyl and other opioids \u201cthat are lethal in trace amounts.\u201d\n\nBut the US has tried this increasingly punitive approach over the years \u2014 and it simply has not worked. As Mark Kleiman, a drug policy expert at the Marron Institute at New York University, previously told me, \u201cWe did the experiment. In 1980, we had about 15,000 people behind bars for drug dealing. And now we have about 450,000 people behind bars for drug dealing. And the prices of all major drugs are down dramatically. So if the question is do longer sentences lead to a higher drug price and therefore less drug consumption, the answer is no.\u201d\n\nOne of the best studies backing this is a 2014 review of the research by Peter Reuter at the University of Maryland and Harold Pollack at the University of Chicago. They found that while simply prohibiting drugs to some extent does raise their prices, there\u2019s no good evidence that tougher punishments or harsher supply elimination efforts do a better job of driving down access to drugs and substance misuse than lighter penalties. So increasing the severity of the punishment doesn\u2019t do much, if anything, to slow the flow of drugs.\n\nIn fact, harsher punishments can be counterproductive \u2014 by punishing people who need treatment, not incarceration. Although \u201ctough on crime\u201d efforts are often framed as going after drug dealers and traffickers, the line between who is a dealer or trafficker versus a user can be blurry. A 2017 Bureau of Justice Statistics report, for instance, found that \u201cnearly a third of drug offenders (30 percent of state prisoners and 29 percent of jail inmates) said they committed the offense to get drugs or money for drugs.\u201d\n\nThe failure of the punitive policies is one reason why drug policy experts have emphasized other approaches to resolving the opioid epidemic \u2014 particularly more treatment (including medications like methadone and buprenorphine), more harm reduction (such as better access to the opioid overdose antidote naloxone), fewer painkiller prescriptions (while ensuring the drugs are available to those who really need them), and policies that can help address the root cause of addiction (like mental health issues and socioeconomic despair).\n\nBut Trump\u2019s plan and his speech unveiling it on Monday seem focused on the criminal justice side of things \u2014 the opposite of what experts have recommended. And now his administration is implementing that plan.\n\nFor more on Trump\u2019s opioid epidemic plan, read Vox\u2019s explainer.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Zack Beauchamp", "body": "John Bolton, former ambassador to the United Nations in the Bush administration, is one of the most radically hawkish voices in the American foreign policy conversation. He has said the United States should declare war on both North Korea and Iran. He was credibly accused of both manipulating US intelligence on weapons of mass destruction prior to the Iraq war and abusive treatment of his subordinates. He once \u201cjoked\u201d about knocking 10 stories off the UN building in New York.\n\nAnd now he seems poised to become President Donald Trump\u2019s next national security adviser, which would have significant \u2014 and frightening \u2014 implications for the future of Trump\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nThis rumor has been circulating in earnest since at least last week, when NBC reported that current national security adviser H.R. McMaster, who Trump has never particularly liked, was looking for a way out of the White House. But speculation really escalated on Tuesday afternoon, when Bolton came to the White House and met with the president in the Oval Office. It seemed less like a normal meeting and more like a \u201cjob interview,\u201d as Mieke Eoyang, the vice president for foreign policy at the center-left think tank Third Way, put it in a phone call.\n\nThis interpretation became even more plausible on Tuesday evening, when news broke that one of Trump\u2019s top economic advisers, Gary Cohn, was resigning. Cohn\u2019s departure was widely seen as evidence that Trump\u2019s more moderate advisers \u2014 the people working to restrain his more hardline nationalist impulses \u2014 were losing influence in the White House. McMaster is certainly in that camp, which makes the rumors of his impending departure easier to believe.\n\nSo while we don\u2019t know for sure that Bolton is being actively considered to replace McMaster, there\u2019s at least some evidence to suggest that he is. What would that mean for the Trump administration, and the world?\n\nThe first thing to note is that Bolton would, according to a trio of foreign policy experts from different political affiliations that I spoke to, be a disastrous choice. His track record in government, connections to anti-Muslim groups, and stated views in op-eds and public speeches all suggest that he would push Trump to take extremely dangerous positions on issues like North Korea, Iran, and ISIS.\n\n\u201cI operate on the assumption that John Bolton should be kept as far away from the levers of foreign policy as possible,\u201d says Christopher Preble, the vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. \u201cI think I would rest easy if he was dog catcher in Stone Mountain, Georgia. But maybe not.\u201d\n\nSecond, the fact that Bolton seems to already have Trump\u2019s ear \u2014 you don\u2019t get an Oval Office invite just to chat \u2014 illustrates a fundamental and growing problem with the Trump administration. The president is extremely and fundamentally influenced by the conservative infotainment sphere, most notably Fox News \u2014 where Bolton is an on-air fixture. \n\nBolton, a marginal figure in DC foreign policy circles since his departure from the Bush administration, has managed to become influential again because of his success in the insular world of conservative media and advocacy groups. As a result, American foreign policy may be soon be shaped by someone who seems to truly believe that war is the answer to the world\u2019s most pressing problems.\n\nBolton\u2019s early career shows why he\u2019d be a dangerous national security adviser\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        John Bolton at the 2018 CPAC conference.\n      \n      \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nBolton is, somewhat ironically, a quintessential creature of the Washington swamp.\n\nAfter graduating Yale Law School in 1974, where he had become friends with future Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, he went into private practice in Washington. He made a name for himself working in conservative politics, becoming vice president of the right-wing American Enterprise Institute and serving in mid-level roles in both the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until the George W. Bush administration that Bolton rose to greater prominence. In May 2001, Bush appointed him to be undersecretary of state for arms control, basically the top diplomat focusing on weapons of mass destruction. This position became fairly important in the run-up to the Iraq war, as the Bush administration\u2019s case against Saddam focused on his alleged nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons.\n\nBolton took the hardest of possible lines. He forcefully argued that Iraq had WMD \u2014 \u201cwe are confident that Saddam Hussein has hidden weapons of mass destruction,\u201d as he put in one 2002 speech. After Bush\u2019s 2002 State of the Union speech connecting North Korea, Iraq, and Iran as an \u201cAxis of Evil,\u201d Bolton insisted that this wasn\u2019t just rhetoric \u2014 that there was \u2018\u2019a hard connection between these regimes \u2014 an \u2018axis\u2019 along which flow dangerous weapons and dangerous technology.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe was involved in shaping US intelligence in the run-up to the war \u2014 and not in a good way. In 2002, Bolton\u2019s staff prepared a speech alleging that Cuba had an active biological weapons program. This wasn\u2019t true, and the State Department\u2019s lead bioweapons analyst at the time would not sign off on the claim. Per the analyst\u2019s sworn testimony to Congress, Bolton then called the analyst into his office, screamed at him, and then sent for his boss. In this conversation, per the Washington Post\u2019s David Ignatius, he derisively referred to the analyst as a \u201cmunchkin\u201d and then attempted to get him transferred to a different department.\n\nThis was cruel and unprofessional, but also dangerous. Carl Ford, then the assistant secretary of state for intelligence and research, testified that Bolton\u2019s assault on the analyst had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d throughout the department, freezing out dissent on proliferation issues beyond Cuba. John Prados, a fellow at George Washington University\u2019s National Security Archives, came to an even broader conclusion in a study of declassified Bush administration documents: Bolton bears a significant amount of blame for the politicized intelligence used to justify the decision to attack Iraq.\n\n\u201cAlthough Bolton\u2019s actions did not concern Iraq directly, they came to a high point during the summer of 2002 \u2014 the exact moment when Iraq intelligence issues were on the front burner \u2014 and they aimed at offices which played a central role in producing Iraq intelligence,\u201d Prados writes. \u201cAnalysts working on Iraq intelligence could not be blamed for concluding that their own careers might be in jeopardy if they supplied answers other than what the Bush administration wanted to hear.\u201d\n\nNone of this got Bolton fired. In fact, it got him promoted: In March 2005, President Bush nominated him to be US ambassador to the UN, one of the most important diplomatic positions in the entire government. \n\nBolton\u2019s Senate confirmation hearing turned into a vicious fight, largely over his role in shaping the faulty prewar intelligence about Iraq. But his management style, as exemplified by the munchkin insult, also became a huge issue. When Ford was called to testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he bluntly said Bolton\u2019s personality should disqualify him from holding high office. Ford called him a \u201cbully\u201d who \u201ckisses up and punches down,\u201d among other things.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m as conservative as John Bolton is,\u201d Ford told the committee. \u201cBut the fact is that the collateral damage and the personal hurt that he causes is not worth the price that had to be paid.\u201d\n\nMultiple people who had worked with Bolton came out of the woodwork to speak to these issues. Perhaps the most harrowing such account came in an open letter, written by a former federal contractor named Melody Townsel, recalling a time that she raised issues surrounding the use of funds in a contract Bolton was working on. He didn\u2019t take it well:\n\nMr. Bolton proceeded to chase me through the halls of a Russian hotel \u2014 throwing things at me, shoving threatening letters under my door and, generally, behaving like a madman. For nearly two weeks, while I awaited fresh direction from my company and from US AID, John Bolton hounded me in such an appalling way that I eventually retreated to my hotel room and stayed there. Mr. Bolton, of course, then routinely visited me there to pound on the door and shout threats.\n\nAll in all, according to then-Sen. Joe Biden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time, testimony from at least five people confirmed multiple instances of Bolton behaving abusively towards subordinates and retaliating against intelligence professionals who challenged his policy positions. For these reasons, Bolton could not be confirmed by the Senate \u2014 which was, at the time, controlled by Republicans.\n\nBolton\u2019s Iraq-era activities are extraordinarily relevant for understanding what he might push for as Trump\u2019s national security adviser. \n\nTechnically, his primary job would be running the National Security Council, which exists to coordinate and synthesize the sometimes conflicting policy proposals that emerge from the Pentagon, State Department, and other agencies. He would present the president with strategic assessments of high-level officials like the secretaries of defense and state, offer his own thinking, then communicate Trump\u2019s ultimate decision to the agencies and work to ensure it\u2019s implemented. \n\nPut another way, his job is managing the information that comes to the president and then presenting a clear-eyed and accurate assessment of what\u2019s happening and how to respond to it. Yet Bolton\u2019s history suggests a long and storied history of cherry-picking intelligence to support his preferred hawkish policies. \n\n\u201cI think he would not be someone who would be counseling restraint, or to think about the consequences of their actions,\u201d says Eoyang. \u201cBolton is so much of an ideologue that I don\u2019t think he would accurately portray consequences [of policy options] to the president.\u201d\n\nHis reported history of berating and undermining anyone who attempted to challenge him would further stifle dissent. He\u2019d have more power over the White House national security staff as national security adviser than anyone other than the president, giving him unprecedented ability to act as a \u201cbully,\u201d in Ford\u2019s words. \n\nIt\u2019s very plausible that Bolton would accelerate the brain drain from the federal government that already seems to be taking shape \u2014 not just in the White House, but across the different departments that make foreign policy.\n\n\u201cBolton hates the State Department. He portrays US diplomats as closet Democrats and appeasers,\u201d Richard Gowan, a professor at NYU who has studied Bolton\u2019s career, recalls. \u201cAs NSA, he would almost certainly encourage the hollowing out of State Trump and Tillerson have begun.\u201d\n\nBolton represents the Fox News-ification of foreign policy\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        John Bolton in one of his many public appearances.\n      \n      \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nUltimately, Bolton did get the UN ambassador position \u2014 though without the Senate\u2019s permission. In August 2005, President Bush appointed him to the post while the Senate was out of session (a so-called \u201crecess appointment\u201d). \n\nBolton\u2019s year-and-a-half at the UN was characterized by showy condemnations of the organization, which infuriated American allies, but he had little influence on the UN or the overall arc of Bush\u2019s second-term foreign policy.\n\n\u201cBolton raised hell at the UN, but his actual power was quite limited,\u201d Gowan recalls. \u201cCondi Rice and the mainstream conservatives in the second Bush administration often ignored him. He is quite open about this in his memoirs from that period, which are fun.\u201d\n\nIn December 2006, Bolton called it quits, returning to civilian life. He became a fixture on Fox News and conservative talk radio, where his confirmation fight and anti-UN rhetoric was hailed as a sign of his willingness to speak truth to power. He was so prominent in these spheres, mostly through his contract as a Fox contributor, that he considered running for president in both 2012 and 2016.\n\nBolton was particularly popular among a small but influential group of hardline anti-Islam activists, the \u201ccounter-jihad\u201d movement, who believe the US government was being infiltrated by Islamists and that Islamic law was quietly taking over the US legal system.\n\nBolton wrote the forward to a book by two of the most prominent counter-jihadists, Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer, in 2010. In 2016, Bolton spoke at a conference held by the American Freedom Alliance, considered a \u201chate group\u201d by the Southern Poverty Law Center, titled \u201cCan Islam and the West Coexist?\u201d His speech contained a \u201cjoke\u201d whose punchline was that President Obama was a Muslim.\n\nIn his many media appearances and public appearances, Bolton never wavered from the kind of hawkish policy views he established during the Bush administration. In a 2015 New York Times op-ed, Bolton advocated for a US and/or Israeli airstrike on Iranian nuclear facilities. \u201cTime is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSuch action should be combined with vigorous American support for Iran\u2019s opposition, aimed at regime change in Tehran.\u201d\n\nSince Trump took office, Bolton has put the media savvy and experience with the conservative movement he\u2019s developed to good use \u2014 using various levers to influence the president. In just the first months of 2018, Bolton has appeared on Fox News 19 times, or roughly twice a week on average. He has used those appearances to sell his policy preferences, warning against diplomacy with North Korea and encouraging the Kingdom of Jordan to annex the West Bank (much of which remains under Israeli occupation despite the fact that the vast majority of its citizens are Palestinian).\n\nDuring the early Trump administration, then-White House senior strategist Steve Bannon approached Bolton as part of a plan to get around Cabinet members, like Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, who opposed withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. Bolton drafted a five-page memo detailing his proposal for tearing up the deal, which he then published in the National Review after Bannon departed the White House.\n\nAnd in February 2018, he published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal arguing that the US needed to solve the nuclear stand-off with North Korea by force.\n\n\u201cPre-emption opponents argue that action is not justified because Pyongyang does not constitute an \u2018imminent threat.\u2019 They are wrong,\u201d Bolton wrote. \u201cIt is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current \u201cnecessity\u201d posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons by striking first.\u201d\n\nBolton\u2019s record in the Bush administration and general hawkishness made him a marginal figure in DC foreign policy conversations. So after leaving, he cannily aligned himself with Fox News and other influential groups on the right, like the counter-jihadists, who saw him as an experienced and credible commentator. This led not only to television news and book contracts, but platforms through which he could potentially influence actual Republican elected officials.\n\nThis reached a kind of apogee with President Trump. Trump sees the world through a televisual lens; he seems to get more information from Fox News than from his daily intelligence briefings. The president values the advice of people who he sees on the TV and other friendly media outlets. Bolton is not seen as a relic of the hated Bush administration; he\u2019s seen as an authoritative and expert Fox voice. According to Bolton\u2019s National Review piece, Trump once told him to \u201ccome in and see me any time\u201d in the White House. \n\nTrump\u2019s biggest problem with Bolton seems to be aesthetic. In December 2016, the Washington Post reported that Bolton was eliminated from the running for secretary of state because Trump \u2014 I swear I\u2019m not making this up \u2014 didn\u2019t like his mustache.\n\n\u201cDonald was not going to like that mustache,\u201d one Trump associate told the Post. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone that\u2019s really close to Donald that has a beard that he likes.\u201d\n\nPerhaps because of the mustache, Trump hasn\u2019t taken Bolton\u2019s policy advice to heart. There\u2019s no war with North Korea and the Iran deal remains (largely) intact. But Tuesday\u2019s Oval Office meeting suggests that Bolton\u2019s influence on the president may be growing. If he\u2019s not going to be appointed the next national security adviser, he\u2019s at least got the president\u2019s ear.\n\nAnd Bolton\u2019s ascendancy has a lot of foreign policy analysts concerned.\n\n\u201cIf Bolton becomes the national security advisor, the United States has not hit rock bottom in our international relations,\u201d says Eoyang. \u201cWe could go lower.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Tara Golshan", "body": "President Donald Trump is threatening to shut down the government, tweeting that he is considering vetoing the $1.3 trillion spending bill Congress passed at 1 am Friday because it does not reflect his immigration priorities. A veto would likely cause a government shutdown, as lawmakers have already departed for a two-week recess without passing a short-term spending bill. \n\nTrump tweeted that the bill does not adequately fund the border wall or address the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which he blames Democrats for. Without any action in Congress, the fate of DACA, which the Trump administration pledged to end this year, is currently tied up in courts.\n\n\n\nI am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2018\n\n\n\n\nInsofar that the government funding package largely ignored Trump\u2019s hardline immigration agenda, the president is right to be angry. As Vox\u2019s Dara Lind explained, the bill actually reins in the country\u2019s immigration enforcement apparatus, doesn\u2019t touch so-called \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d and doesn\u2019t come close to fully funding Trump\u2019s southern border well.\n\nAs for DACA, however, Trump should probably direct his frustration at his own party. For months, congressional Republicans have spent all their energy to try to persuade Democrats to separate government spending and immigration. When most Democrats voted to shut down the government over DACA in January, Republicans took to blaming their Democratic colleagues for holding the government \u201chostage\u201d over the \u201cunrelated issue of illegal immigration.\u201d This time, Democrats complied with their demands.\n\nAs Vox reported last week, Trump\u2019s dissatisfaction with the spending bill over immigration was a long time coming. And this isn\u2019t the first time; in May 2017, he was reportedly talked out of vetoing the 2017 spending bill over a lack of border wall funding. It\u2019s clear lawmakers have no interest in a government shutdown fight this time around \u2014 and are tweeting at Trump to back down \u2014 but Trump has repeatedly shown a willingness to go that far.\n\nThe spending bill ignores Trump\u2019s immigration priorities\nPut simply, Republicans didn\u2019t mount a huge fight for Trump\u2019s hardline immigration agenda.\n\nOn enforcement, the GOP went into this week wanting more funding for the Department of Homeland Security to increase the number of beds for immigrant detainees and to expand enforcement, with a call to fund 1,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and 500 more Customs and Border Protection officers. The final compromise included funding for only an additional 328 Customs and Border Protection officers, and ICE will actually have to reduce the number of detention beds. Needless to say, this isn\u2019t the kind of deportation force Trump\u2019s administration was envisioning. \n\nThe bill also does not defund so-called \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d something the White House specifically called on Congress to do.\n\nThe bill also includes only $1.6 billion worth of border wall funding \u2014 much less than the $25 billion the White House asked for. And it comes with a lot of strings attached; most of the funding will have to go toward repairing existing fencing or toward double fencing where barriers already exist. In other words, this isn\u2019t money for Trump\u2019s big, beautiful wall. \n\nTrump\u2019s White House has been frustrated with the spending bill for a while. Trump officials even tried to back-channel conservative ideas with allies in Congress to defund sanctuary cities or push for more border wall spending, but to no avail. Trump reportedly threatened to veto the bill yesterday, but the White House released a statement that the president supported the package. Now it seems his support is wavering yet again.\n\nDemocrats dropped their DACA demands for the omnibus \u2014 but that\u2019s not why DACA isn\u2019t getting addressed\nIn January, Senate Democrats, frustrated with Trump\u2019s unwillingness to accept a bipartisan proposal to address the nearly 700,000 immigrants in legal limbo under DACA, orchestrated a government shutdown with the support of some Republicans. \n\nThe result was a failed and inconclusive Senate floor debate on the issue. Again, Trump\u2019s hard line on negotiations, including a demand to gut the legal immigration system, tanked any possibility for compromise. Both Democrats and Republicans criticized the White House\u2019s plan. Throughout, Republicans have made every effort to separate DACA and spending.\n\nThen last week, the White House made Democrats another offer on DACA: a two-year temporary extension of DACA to protect the roughly 690,000 undocumented immigrants in the program, in exchange for $25 billion in funding for the southern border wall.\n\nDemocrats said no. After a fraught and ultimately fruitless Senate debate on immigration, and with the program tied up in the courts, they have no incentive to accept anything other than a path to citizenship for the 1.8 million unauthorized immigrants currently in the country who came in as children.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that Democrats have changed their tune on tying spending to DACA, the reason there hasn\u2019t been a deal on DACA has a lot to do with Trump himself.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matthew Yglesias", "body": "Political scientist Larry Bartels\u2019s latest paper is a survey of the state of partisanship in the United States in 2018.

It plots how Democrats evaluate various groups on the x-axis and how Republicans evaluate them on the y-axis. It lets you see comparisons such as: Democrats like the Republican Party more than they like Donald Trump (though they dislike both), but Republicans like Trump more than they like the GOP. \n\nBut it also shows that even in these polarized times, lots of things \u2014 especially nurses, working people, and farmers \u2014 are broadly popular on both sides.

These voters are probably in some sense \u201cup for grabs\u201d in elections \u2014 Democrat Conor Lamb seems to have persuaded a fair number of this kind of Trump voters to back him in last week\u2019s Pennsylvania special election \u2014 but most of them aren\u2019t especially \u201cmoderate\u201d in the sense of clustering around the middle of the chart.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Emily Stewart", "body": "In the wake of Democrat Conor Lamb\u2019s upset victory over Republican Rick Saccone in Pennsylvania\u2019s deeply conservative 18th Congressional District this week, the GOP has yet another thing to worry about: Democrats have a 10-point advantage over Republicans in congressional preference in the 2018 midterm elections, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.  \n\nFifty percent of registered voters say they would prefer a Democratic-controlled Congress, while 40 percent say they want Republicans to maintain control. That\u2019s a change from a January NBC News/WSJ Poll that gave Democrats a six-point edge, 49 percent to 43 percent. And among independents, Democrats have a 12-point lead, with 48 percent of independents saying they prefer a Democratic Congress and 36 percent preferring Republicans. \n\nDemocrats also appear to have an enthusiasm advantage \u2014 60 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of Clinton voters say they have a high degree of interest in the 2018 midterms. Fifty-four percent of Republicans and 37 percent of independents say the same. Young people, however, lag: Only 37 percent of registered voters ages 18-34 say they\u2019re excited about the 2018 vote. \n\nRepublicans have a few reasons to be nervous about the 2018 midterms\nRepublicans dumped millions of dollars to hold Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District in a special election on Tuesday between Democrat Conor Lamb and Republican Rick Saccone. Trump carried the district, which won\u2019t exist in November because the state\u2019s Supreme Court redrew the map to tamp down partisan gerrymandering, by about 20 points in 2016. Lamb still eked out a victory over Saccone.\n\nIt is an ominous sign for the GOP of what might be to come in the November midterms. In a heavily Republican district, backed by $9 million, and with President Donald Trump having campaigned there just days before, the GOP candidate still couldn\u2019t pull out a win. Other recent special elections that in theory shouldn\u2019t have been close have been \u2014 Roy Moore vs. Doug Jones in Alabama, and Jon Ossoff vs. Karen Handel in Georgia, for example.\n\nMoreover, the Pennsylvania special election was the first one where Republicans went all in on their tax cut message, touting the tax bill passed in December that insist will help them win elections in 2018 and beyond. As Vox\u2019s Ella Nilsen and Tara Golshan note, Republicans initially focused on the tax cut messaging in Pennsylvania but by election day had pivoted to decrying so-called sanctuary cities after determining the tax message wasn\u2019t breaking through. (Selling a tax bill that disproportionately benefits the corporations and the wealthy apparently isn\u2019t as easy as anticipated.)\n\nDemocrats have consistently polled better than Republicans on generic Congressional ballots for months. According to RealClearPolitics\u2019 generic ballot polling average, Democrats lead by 7.9 points. In December, RealClearPolitics had them up by about 13 points, but signs point to potentially major gains. Vox\u2019s Andrew Prokop last year laid out how RealClearPolitics\u2019 polling average has played out in actual elections:\n\n\n2002: Republicans +1.7, minor change in Republican-controlled House\n2004: Tied generic ballot, minor change in Republican-controlled House\n2006: Democrats +11.5, wave flips House to Democrats\n2008: Democrats +9, wave further increases Democratic House majority\n2010: Republicans +9.4, wave flips House to Republicans\n2012: Republicans +0.2, minor change in Republican-controlled House\n2014: Republicans +2.4, gains in Republican-controlled House during national GOP wave\n2016: Democrats +0.6, minor change in Republican-controlled House\n\nTrump\u2019s job approval is getting better. It\u2019s still not helping the broader GOP.\nSunday\u2019s NBC News/WSJ poll found that President Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating stands at 43 percent among all Americans, four points higher than where it was in January. FiveThirtyEight\u2019s average of presidential approval polls finds that 40.2 percent of Americans think Trump is doing a good job as president. On January 1, he was at 37.9 percent on average.\n\nIf voters are warming up to Trump slightly (and he still remains historically unpopular compared to his predecessors), that\u2019s not translating to how they feel about Congress. \u201cTrumpism may well help Donald Trump in his 2020 election, but the buck stops there \u2014 which is a flashing red light for Republicans in 2017 or 2018,\u201d Democratic pollster Fred Yang, who conducted the NBC/WSJ poll with GOP pollster Bill McInturff, said in a statement accompanying the results.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "David Roberts", "body": "The New York Times editorial page has come in for a great deal of criticism since it fell under the leadership of James Bennet, previously editor at the Atlantic, in March 2016.\n\nMost recently, new hire Bari Weiss linked to a fake Twitter account as virtually her only evidence in a column devoted to the supposed epidemic of totalitarianism sweeping US universities. (FYI: There is no such epidemic.)\n\nBefore that was the controversy over hiring, and then quickly firing, Quinn Norton, who had Nazi-sympathetic tweets in her past. There was the controversy over hiring Bret Stephens, a climate denier and Woody Allen apologist. There was the controversy over the op-ed/press release by Erik Prince of security contractor Blackwater.\n\nAnd so on. David Uberti at Splinter has a nice rundown of the various fights, along with some trenchant critique. \n\nThe newspaper\u2019s defense, articulated repeatedly by Bennet, news editor Dean Baquet, and onetime ombudsman Liz Spayd, is that the paper is pursuing diversity of opinion, attempting to challenge its readers. \u201cDidn\u2019t we learn from this past election that our goal should be to understand different views?\u201d asked Baquet.\n\nThat defense doesn\u2019t hold up to much scrutiny. As I said in a column on Stephens last year, \u201cit takes a particular sort of insularity to hire a pro-war, anti-Trump white guy as a contribution to diversity on the NYT editorial page.\u201d \n\nIn one of his characteristically scathing columns, Glenn Greenwald notes that the NYT editorial stable currently contains only three women and no Arab-American or Latinx voices; ideologically, it \u201cspans the small gap from establishment centrist Democrats to establishment centrist Republicans.\u201d\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be that hard for the NYT to draw from what lies to the left of those narrow confines. For starters, it could hire a columnist to represent the resurgent left, which rose alongside, but is not dependent on, Bernie Sanders. It stands on its own as a reasonably coherent social critique and policy program, involving greater social provision of basic services, and there are tons of writers who could do it credit.\n\n\nBut representing what lies to the right of those confines is a different and more difficult matter.\n\nThe NYT carries some conservatives, but it does not reflect conservative politics \nThe NYT always had its own, generally liberal editorials, but the opinion page was established in 1970 to provide a venue for a wider range of opinions. \u201cPoints of view in disagreement with the editorial position of The Times,\u201d said publisher Arthur Sulzberger, \u201cwill be particularly welcomed.\u201d And still today, Bennet wrote to Splinter, \u201cwe\u2019re looking to challenge our own and our readers\u2019 assumptions.\u201d\n\nRecently, that concern has taken on a new edge. The traumatic and unexpected 2016 victory of Donald Trump convinced a great many people in elite political circles that they are hopelessly out of touch, there is a whole parallel country of which they are only dimly aware, and they urgently need to understand the perspectives of the people who rallied behind Trump. \n\nThis has led to entire subgenres of news journalism, like \u201crural white people are very upset,\u201d or \u201cTrump supporters still like Trump,\u201d or \u201cget to know this Nazi, he\u2019s just like you and me.\u201d \n\nBut it\u2019s a different dilemma for the opinion page. Bennet clearly believes liberals live in a bubble. He wants to challenge them. It still hasn\u2019t occurred to him to challenge them from the left, so he goes out looking for more conservatives.\n\nBut what kind of conservatives are on offer at NYT? \n\nConsider, oh, David Brooks. His conservatism, of Sam\u2019s Club affectation, fiscal conservatism, tepid social liberalism, and genial trolling of center-leftists at Davos \u2014 who does it speak for in today\u2019s politics, beyond Brooks? \n\nOr Ross Douthat. He is sporadically interesting, often infuriating, but above all, pretty idiosyncratic. His socially conservative \u201creformicon\u201d thing \u2014 who does it speak for in today\u2019s politics, beyond Douthat? \n\nBret Stephens and Bari Weiss are a familiar type of glib contrarian. Their opposition to Trump has given them undue credibility among DC lefties, whom they relentlessly (and boringly) troll. But who are they speaking for? What has the Never Trump movement amounted to? \n\n\nThese writers are, to a (wo)man, alienated from the animating force in US conservatism, which is Trumpism. They command no divisions. They have nothing to do with what is going on in American politics today.\n\nThey might serve the purpose of challenging liberal thinking, but they do not serve the purpose of exposing NYT readers to the people and the movement from which they are allegedly alienated. \n\nIf Bennet wants to do that, he needs to be clear-eyed about what the right is today.\n\nConservatism is now Trumpism\nThe signal feature of the 2016 election is that it settled the question of whether US conservatism \u2014 the actual movement, I mean, not the people in DC think tanks who claim to be its spokespeople \u2014 is animated by a set of shared ideals and policies. It is not.\n\nFor many years, many people have convinced themselves otherwise. A lot of people believe to this day that the Tea Party uprising and the subsequent eight years of hysterical, unremitting, norm-violating opposition to Barack Obama was about small-government philosophy and a devotion to low taxes and less regulation, and had nothing to do with social backlash against a black, cosmopolitan, urban law professor and his diverse, rising coalition. \n\nBut that kind of credulity can only stretch so far, and Donald Trump has stretched it to the snapping point. He abandoned the Very Serious conservative script entirely and the right ate it up. He pledged not to cut Social Security or Medicare, condemned free trade, and insulted the military and intelligence services, and they ate it up. He is a thrice divorced, self-admitted sexual predator indicted on fraud charges and wallowing in the kind of material ostentation that gives David Brooks nightmares, and they ate it up.\n\nBefore Trump, they thought the economy was terrible and Russia was bad. Now they think the economy is great and Russia is good. He\u2019s one of their people, he hates who they hate, and he drives the libs crazy; that\u2019s good enough.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Keith Bedford/The Boston Globe via Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nIn office, Trump has swerved this way and that on immigration, guns, taxes, health care, foreign policy, and trade, changing positions without warning, leaving his staff and supporters to scurry along after him, offering post-hoc justifications. \n\nHe has, admittedly, governed like an orthodox conservative (insofar as he\u2019s gotten any governance done), but that is not from any evident commitment to, or even awareness of, the conservative intellectual tradition. It\u2019s just that he\u2019s weak, vain, easily influenced, and surrounded by conservative ideologues.\n\nThere cannot be an intellectual Trumpism \u2014 a Trumpist philosophy, a Trumpist argument \u2014 because Trump is devoted only to Trump, only to bringing himself glory and defeating his perceived enemies. For now, his interests overlap (mostly) with the interests of the white, suburban and rural conservative base. The only conceivable motivation to support him is tribal; the only argument a tribalist needs to reward himself and punish his enemies is, \u201cWe won.\u201d\n\nThat means anyone who is devoted to the conservative intellectual tradition, anyone who thinks of themselves as a conservative through devotion to small government and traditional morality, has had to peel off. There is no way to pretend that Trump represents that tradition; he himself does not even try.\n\nSo, how many of these \u201ctrue\u201d conservatives did there turn out to be? Almost none! A few intellectuals and writers have jumped ship (David Frum, Bill Kristol, George Will), but the Wall Street Journal, Fox, Breitbart, and the rest have happily adapted to acting as state media. For all intents and purposes, Trump commands the support and loyalty of the GOP coalition. \n\nThe ragged band devoted to the principles of conservative governing philosophy is in exile, with no home. It was, it turns out, almost entirely epiphenomenal to the movement; its roots were an inch deep. \n\nEven the conservative lawmakers alleged to be horrified by Trump, leaking anonymously to reporters about how terrible he is, scarcely ever stand up to him, for the simple reason that he\u2019s enormously popular with the base.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        No, I will never stop using this GIF.\n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nTrumpist conservatism is not motivated by ideas, but resentments\nSo what motivates this swell of right-wing support for Trump? At this point, though many people on all sides still refuse to acknowledge it, the evidence is overwhelming: It was cultural backlash, against immigrants, minorities, uppity women, liberals, and all the other forces seen as dislodging traditional white men from their centrality in American culture. \n\nI recommend browsing through this thread, which rounds up more than a dozen studies, papers, and surveys:\n\n\nThey all point in the same direction: Race and gender had unusually high salience in the 2016 election, and what distinguished Trump supporters most of all, more than income or education, was racism and misogyny, i.e., feelings of hostility toward minorities and women. \n\nWhat Trump revealed, in the most dramatic way possible, is that the conservative base in the US today is driven not by ideology but by white resentment. That\u2019s the underlying thread. Trump may lurch back and forth on policy \u2014 or more often, demonstrate an almost cosmic ignorance of policy \u2014 but he speaks to, and in the voice of, America\u2019s angry whites, who want their imagined old America back. He is the prototypical Fox News viewer, tossing off endless insults, conspiracy theories, and furious aggrievement. \n\nWhat\u2019s happening in the US today is not a contest of governing philosophies. Trump doesn\u2019t have one and his administration barely tries to pretend it does. It\u2019s not a philosophy or a plan that won, it was a team, a tribe. They are living it up, rewarding their friends and ratfucking everything the other team did before them. \n\nMore broadly, what\u2019s going on in American politics is a contest between those who believe that America is an idea and those who believe America is a people, a particular culture \u2014 white, Christian, and patriarchal. Trump represents those who want that culture restored to primacy.\n\nHow can the NYT opinion page expose its readers to that?\n\nThe NYT cannot host true conservatism because true conservatism does not share its standards\nAs I said, the conservatives who care about conservatism as an intellectual tradition and a governing philosophy have mostly jumped ship. If the NYT wants to find authentic expressions of the sentiments animating Trump supporters, it will have to look beyond the confines of the elite establishment, to Breitbart, TownHall, InfoWars, or one of avowedly right-wing outlets where conservatives cluster. \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        CJR\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nIt will have to recruit Sean Hannity or Tomi Lahren or Mark Steyn someone who thinks of liberals as godless traitors and accepts ludicrous conspiracy theories about Democratic staffer Seth Rich being assassinated or Hillary Clinton colluding with Russia to defeat Donald Trump or Democrats running a child prostitution ring out of a pizza restaurant. It will have to recruit Ben Shapiro to run serial variations on \u201crap is crap\u201d or \u201cwhites are the real victims of racism.\u201d\n\nIt will have to recruit popular conservative columnist Kurt Schlichter, who mused this week that because \u201cthe central tenet of the Democrat Party platform is now hatred and contempt for Normal Americans,\u201d there is probably going to be a second Civil War, which conservatives will win, because they have more guns and liberals are easy to kill. (There\u2019s a long section speculating on how a right-wing militia could invade San Francisco, which is \u201ca hotbed of treason.\u201d)\n\n\nThe people who support Trump have been embedded in a hermetically sealed right-wing media bubble for so long that they only know liberals as horrific caricatures and only experience politics as a war to save white Christian culture from its sworn enemies. They are exposed to endless lies and conspiracy theories designed to keep them in a frenzy, convinced that Antifa is around the corner and Sharia Law is imminent. \n\nIf the NYT wanted to expose its readers to the motive force of contemporary conservatism, that\u2019s the kind of stuff it would run.\n\nBut let\u2019s be real, James Bennet is not going to run that stuff in the NYT. It can sometimes be difficult to tell, but the NYT does have standards of accuracy, even on the opinion page, and most of that stuff I mentioned contains falsehoods. (The Democrats are not running a child prostitution ring.) \n\nThe NYT expects a certain civility, and Breitbart types are incapable of discussing opponents as human beings. The NYT has decided, like most mainstream US institutions, that overt racism and misogyny are unacceptable \u2014 not part of the diversity of viewpoints it seeks to represent. But without them, the picture is incomplete.\n\nMost importantly, the NYT sees the opinion page as a contest of ideas. And fundamentally, what Trumpist conservatives are advocating for are not ideas, but a demographic, a tribe. \n\nIt\u2019s a tribe that has split off from mainstream institutions, rejects mainstream standards of accuracy, and now uses media entirely as a tool, a weapon. Its goal is to defeat the libs; what\u2019s good is anything libs hate.\n\nThe most popular voices of the right-wing base are simply not engaged in the same undertaking as the NYT. That makes hosting them on the opinion page rather fraught.\n\nIt\u2019s true that NYT readers have been insulated from contemporary conservatism\nHere is the scary truth that NYT editors and readers alike resist: US politics today is not a contest of ideas or governing philosophies. We are witnessing a massive revanchist upheaval \u2014 against bourgeois morality and standards of conduct, against changing demographics and economies, against assumptions about governance and respect for norms, against the status quo \u2014 by a culture that is stagnating even as the country changes around it, which it experiences as a loss of dignity and prestige.\n\nNot everyone involved is driven by tribal resentment, not every Trump voter indulges in misogyny or racism, but every member of the current conservative coalition has decided that those things are acceptable, or at the very least, not disqualifying \u2014 less important than lower taxes or immigration crackdowns. \n\nEven if they do not share Trump\u2019s ignorant, hateful impulses, even if they do not endorse his careening, incompetent governance, even if they do not countenance the grotesque corruption of his family and his administration, they support the coalition that enables those things. They are supporting a tribe with a strongman leader, not a set of ideas.\n\n\nThere\u2019s no argument for that, nothing to plausibly fill an editorial page. As I said, the tribalist\u2019s only argument is, \u201cWe won.\u201d The only idea is: to the victors the spoils.\n\nWhen the NYT opinion page pretends that conservatism is David Brooks or Bret Stephens when it maintains the comforting illusion that American politics is a contest of ideas, it is not exposing its readers to uncomfortable truths \u2014 it is sheltering them. \n\nDo NYT readers \u2014 who mostly read mainstream sources, mostly live in cities, mostly are not exposed to right-wing media \u2014 understand that the most active voices on the American right today are filled with paranoid rage, hopped up on lies and conspiracy theories, unmoved by reason, and devoted to their total destruction? Do they understand that the values and norms they assume safe and sacrosanct are in fact under heavy siege? Do they know that American democracy is in danger of coming apart?\n\nI\u2019m not sure they do; I think they still imagine Republican moderates gathered in a cave somewhere, ready to swoop in and take charge again at the sight of the David Brooks bat signal. \n\nIf the NYT wants to challenge their assumptions, it should challenge those.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matthew Yglesias", "body": "When Donald Trump fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on a trumped-up pretext and then sent a series of tweets lambasting special counsel Robert Mueller and his team in dishonest terms, it sparked a new spasm of concern about the future of Mueller\u2019s investigation. \n\nPeople are right to worry about this. In particular, congressional Republicans ought to worry about it a lot more than they currently are, since sacking Mueller on impulse before the midterms would likely make it harder for them to maintain their majorities. \n\nBut the Mueller-centric focus obscures a much broader problem. Trump\u2019s decision sends a message down the ranks to typical Justice Department attorneys to be wary about taking on Trump or his associates. \n\n Trump has a lot of fingers in a lot of pies. So do his various family members and the B-list rich guys who round out his Cabinet. So do the wealthy individuals who are donating to his increasingly aggressive fundraising efforts. This creates a lot of potential points of intersection between Trump and his associates and the law \u2014 points of intersection that won\u2019t necessarily involve anything as thrilling as Russian espionage, that certainly won\u2019t be investigated by anyone as august as Mueller and his prosecutorial all-star team, and that aren\u2019t being followed intensely by the news media.\n\nThis \u2014 in the halls of normal US attorneys\u2019 offices and regulatory agencies \u2014 is where the real chilling effect of Trump\u2019s war on the rule of law is likely to be felt. And an all-hands-on-deck drive to secure Mueller\u2019s position risks simply affirming to officials tasked with enforcing the law in more banal ways that nobody is out there prepared to protect them. \n\nThe special counsel is special\nConsider that Mueller\u2019s situation is genuinely special. \n\nWere he to be fired, it would be a huge national story with obvious political consequences.  What\u2019s more, there\u2019s no good alternative to firing Mueller. You can\u2019t quietly transfer him to the Alaska office or make his life miserable with tedious paperwork. He\u2019ll investigate Trump right up until the day he is fired. \n\nAnd if he does get fired, he and his team will have a big story to tell the press and an eager audience for it. The question will then become whether the voters care about a Trump action that amounts to an implicit admission of guilt.\n\nMost important of all, neither Mueller nor the other senior members of his team have anything to lose personally in this. Mueller is an affluent retired former FBI director who took this gig because he wanted to investigate Trump. His team is composed of well-known, very successful litigators and investigators who wanted to be part of the investigation of the century. Obviously, none of them want to see the investigation shut down. But they have no reason to fear for their welfare or livelihood if it is, so they\u2019re not going to pull any punches. \n\nThe real problem is that almost nobody else in the federal government enjoys that kind of freedom. \n\nProsecutors need to be able to investigate the president\u2019s allies\nUS attorneys are appointed by the president of the United States, and obviously, some political consideration goes into their selection. But generally speaking, federal prosecutors do their work in a professional and nonpartisan manner. Early in Barack Obama\u2019s term of office, federal investigators in Illinois charged Gov. Rod Blagojevich in a manner that was not only inconvenient to national Democrats but arguably cost them a blue Senate seat from 2011 to 2016. Later in Obama\u2019s term, a federal case against Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ) wound up nearly costing Democrats a different blue Senate seat.\n\nAnd there was nothing particularly unusual about this. One doesn\u2019t even exactly need to believe that Obama or his predecessors were too pure of heart to interfere with federal investigations for partisan reasons \u2014 they were simply cautious. \n\nTo be seen as meddling in a federal investigation in that way would have been a huge scandal had it been uncovered, and traditionally, presidents have tried to avoid generating huge scandals. \n\nBut Trump, by firing McCabe and Comey on thin pretexts and then more or less immediately admitting that the pretexts were not the real reason, sends a powerful message: He doesn\u2019t care. Everyone working in every federal agency in America knows that fear of being caught isn\u2019t going to stop Trump from engaging in political meddling. If you look into malfeasance committed by a business he owns \u2014 or that his son-in-law owns, or one of his friends or donors or other associates \u2014 and he gets mad about it, he might stomp on you and not worry too much about the possibility of getting caught. And the mere fact that this is so obvious means the stomping doesn\u2019t actually need to come from the West Wing at all.\n\nWorking toward the Donald\nPart of the normal scandal aversion of a normal administration is that middle managers in the federal bureaucracy who sincerely support the president will try not to create a scandal. So it\u2019s not just that Obama would not personally reach down into an investigation and meddle for political purposes, but a passionate Obama fan who also happens to run an Environmental Protection Agency field office wouldn\u2019t do it either. The top leadership sets a tone, and while the tone isn\u2019t universally followed, it does exert a big influence on people\u2019s practical behavior. \n\nTrump, by contrast, has sent a clear signal in the opposite direction \u2014 he wants federal public servants, up to and including FBI special agents, to act like they are his personal employees. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll all do it \u2014 most of them won\u2019t. But some of them will. The actual political appointees at every agency know what\u2019s expected of them, and to the extent that there are ambitious and career-minded Trump fans scattered throughout the government \u2014 which is surely the case at the federal police agencies, if not the regulatory ones \u2014 they know that excessive service of Trump\u2019s personal interests will be rewarded rather than punished. And folks who are merely career-minded will know that what\u2019s good for them is to keep their heads down and just try to ride this out. \n\nAnd these rank-and-file employees, critically, aren\u2019t Robert Mueller. They have non-glamorous jobs that they may actually need to pay the rent and feed their families. They can be retaliated against in more subtle ways than a firing, and the news media won\u2019t necessarily care about them or their stories. \n\nMueller mania lets Republicans off the hook\nNone of this is to deny the unique significance of Mueller and his investigation. But the narrow focus on preserving the integrity of that particular inquiry ends up setting the bar for Trump and the GOP too low. Ever since McCabe was fired, Republicans on Capitol Hill are mostly staying quiet, but a few, like Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have spoken up to caution Trump not to fire Mueller. \n\n\n\nLindsey Graham reiterates this to Trump when asked by @jaketapper about the potential firing of Mueller. \u201cIf he tried to do that, that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency. We are a rule-of-laws nation. \u201c\n\u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) March 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s good as far as it goes. But it simply doesn\u2019t go very far. \n\nNobody on the GOP side \u2014 not Graham, not John McCain, not Jeff Flake, and certainly nobody on the House side of things \u2014 has indicated any commitment to insisting that Trump uphold the rule of law overall or a general defense of the integrity and independence of federal law enforcement. \n\nAnd yet it\u2019s precisely here that the danger is greatest, of enforcement either being used selectively to punish Trump\u2019s enemies or being ignored selectively to reward his friends.

And the 28 point improvement on Hillary Clinton\u2019s results in Kentucky is at best a moral victory. But in the aggregate, special elections are painting an important picture of what seems to be a building Democratic wave. And since Trump took office, Democrats have picked up an impressive 40 seats in special elections across the country. \n\nDemocrats are cleaning up in special elections\nAccording to an extremely useful comprehensives spreadsheet compiled by Daily Kos, across 70 special elections in 2017, Democrats ran 10 points ahead of Clinton and 7 points ahead of Obama\u2019s 2012 results. Those numbers have accelerated into 2018.

Scott Walker has decided to leave a number of formerly GOP-held seats vacant rather than schedule special elections his party might lose, national Republicans are pushing the panic button on an upcoming special House election in Pennsylvania, and GOP leadership is letting scandal-plagued Rep.

Tim Murphy, who resigned last year after reports revealed he had asked a woman he was having an affair with to have an abortion. Lamb has declared victory, but Saccone has yet to concede.\n\nRegardless of outcome, after an extensive and heavy-handed media campaign, the results may force the GOP to reconsider its messaging and recruitment. Clearly, money didn\u2019t get them very far.\n\nThe history and demographics of Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District, which covers the southwest corner of the state, should have made for an easy race for Saccone; the region is older and very white (total minority population is less than 5 percent), and was rated as an R+11 district \u2014 a heavy Republican tilt in part due to Pennsylvania\u2019s partisan gerrymandering that the state Supreme Court recently ruled unconstitutional. \n\nInstead, Tuesday night was a wakeup call for Republicans, who were test-driving their messaging strategy for the 2018 midterms \u2014 and just watched it crash into a Democratic wave.\n\nSaccone was an expensive bet\nAfter Saccone\u2019s campaign showed a lackluster fundraising effort, outside Republican groups \u2014 including the national campaign arm for House Republicans \u2014 jumped in to get Saccone over the finish line.\n\nRepublican-aligned groups have greatly outspent Democrats in the race. According to the Washington Post, as of February 27, Saccone\u2019s campaign and allied groups had spent a total of $9.1 million on the race, between the Congressional Leadership Fund, the National Republican Congressional Committee, and others. Meanwhile, Democratic groups and labor unions had spent less than $1 million. \n\nThe official campaign arm for House Republicans reported spending another $619,664 on media ahead of the March 13 election for Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District House seat, bringing the total to $3.5 million on media buys as of last week, in a last-minute panic. \n\nTrump\u2019s surrogates have stumped for Saccone, and the president has gone to the district twice, most recently for a campaign rally last Saturday, in which he called on Congress to defund \u201csanctuary cities\u201d and supported giving drug dealers the death penalty. The White House insisted Trump\u2019s January visit was purely to bump the new tax law.\n\nIt was clear Republicans didn\u2019t want to face another news cycle about the Democratic takeover.\n\n\u201cWhen Trump leaned so hard into this district, sending his surrogates and then going in Saturday \u2014 they are taking this as the bellwether of what is going to happen in the midterms and taking this as the \u2018ride or die\u2019 for what it could be,\u201d Alison Dagnes, a political scientist with Pennsylvania\u2019s Shippensburg University, said.\n\nBut the GOP wasn\u2019t able to avoid the embarrassment. And Pennsylvania Republicans will face a new challenge in November. This district\u2019s demographics will change when the seat comes for reelection under a redrawn map that\u2019s more favorable to Democrats \u2014 with big implications for Democratic efforts to regain control of the House of Representatives in 2018. Republicans currently hold 12 of Pennsylvania\u2019s 18 House seats with Saccone\u2019s loss.\n\nRepublicans just test-drove their messaging \u2014 and they crashed\nRepublicans said their tax cuts would help them win elections. But it couldn\u2019t secure them a Republican seat in a Trump-loving district.\n\nThis race was a rocky test drive for Republicans, who tried to put their tax plan front and center and saw their candidate suffer a devastating defeat. For weeks, the bill was the subject of countless ads and consumed Saccone\u2019s talking points. Trump even visited the state for a conveniently located GOP tax rally in Western Pennsylvania in January, which the White House insisted was not directly related to Saccone\u2019s candidacy.\n\nAt the beginning of February, almost two-thirds of GOP ads were about the Republican tax law, according to a Politico analysis \u2014 but it didn\u2019t stick. Too much else has happened. By election day, the same groups had pivoted sharply to decrying so-called sanctuary cities in a last-ditch effort to turn out the base. That wasn\u2019t enough either.\n\nFor now, Republicans don\u2019t appear to be changing course; this is just another scare.\n\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s going to be a centerpiece \u2014 without a doubt,\u201d Matt Gorman, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee, the official campaign arm for House Republicans, told the Washington Post of the GOP\u2019s messaging strategy for 2018. \u201cThe law is getting more popular both in public and internal polls. Voters don\u2019t need to take our word for it; they can see the companies announcing bonuses and perks for themselves.\u201d\n\nWith an unpopular Republican president in office, and a wave of Democratic enthusiasm, Democrats think they have a shot to take back the House.

Or are they \u2014 as many who\u2019ve worked with them claim \u2014 sort of a joke? Or something in between?\n\nCambridge Analytica began with a British PR firm that\u2019s been around for decades\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        The operations center in the 1995 James Bond film Goldeneye. This is relevant to Cambridge Analytica, I promise.\n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nBefore there was Cambridge Analytica, there was the Strategic Communication Laboratories Group \u2014 SCL Group, for short. Founded in 1993 by a British ad man named Nigel Oakes, they are, basically, a messaging and PR firm that\u2019s done work for governments, politicians, and militaries around the world. Their clients included governments and politicians in Indonesia, Thailand, Kenya, the UK, and elsewhere.\n\nSCL tends to describe its capabilities in grandiose and somewhat unsettling language \u2014 the company has touted its expertise at \u201dpsychological warfare\u201d and \u201cinfluence operations.\u201d They\u2019ve long claimed that their sophisticated understanding of human psychology helps them target and persuade people of their client\u2019s preferred message. Lately, their preferred buzzwords have focused on \u201cbig data\u201d and \u201cpsychographic profiling.\u201d \n\nYet articles from the Wall Street Journal and the Independent on SCL\u2019s work circa 1999 and 2000 describe what sound like relatively standard political messaging and PR work for the Thai and Indonesian regimes, alongside a penchant for secrecy and ethically questionable activities. \n\nThe stories allege, for instance, that SCL tried to place a story in an Indonesian paper based on a purported government document that was apparently fake, and how it repeatedly tried to operate through front and shell groups while obscuring where its funds were coming from. SCL also did more standard things like summarizing news reports for its clients and placing TV ads.\n\nPerhaps most instructive is that both reports describe how in Thailand and Indonesia, SCL set up operations centers full of computers and TV screens that were designed to look quite impressive. Per the Observer, these rooms looked much like the villain\u2019s computer-filled complex from the 1995 James Bond film Goldeneye. (And in fact, SCL hired the company that made that Goldeneye film set to put together a similar ops center.) \n\nWhat those fancy facilities were actually used for, though, was far less clear. The Independent wrote that \u201cits primary function appears to have been cosmetic,\u201d and quoted an Indonesian source calling it \u201cjust like a movie set to impress the clients.\u201d\n\nSome of SCL\u2019s operations ended badly \u2014 the Indonesian president the firm worked for was deposed, and the Thai contract concluded with a falling out and local reports that Oakes had violated the country\u2019s immigration laws. Nevertheless, Oakes and SCL proved remarkably adept at convincing new clients to write them big checks. \n\nAfter 9/11, the firm began to tout its alleged expertise at anti-terrorism and anti-jihadi messaging at a time when Western governments were eager to pay for such work.  (\u201cPsych-ops was big business and people were just chucking money around,\u201d a source told the Observer.) \n\nAnd finally, in 2013, SCL found a wealthy American who\u2019d give them a great deal of money indeed.\n\nSteve Bannon and the Mercer family worked with the Brits to found Cambridge Analytica \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Steve Bannon.\n      \n      \n        Sylvain Lefevre/Getty\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nAround 2013, word of SCL\u2019s work reached the ears of Steve Bannon \u2014 and he was intrigued. Bannon was then running Breitbart News, but perhaps more importantly, he was a trusted political adviser to Robert and Rebekah Mercer, the father-daughter pair of conservative mega-donors. Bannon connected SCL with the Mercers, and the British firm pitched a major  expansion of its operation into US politics. \n\nSCL claimed to be able to do a new type of political targeting that would be based on modeling individuals\u2019 personalities (rather than just demographic traits like age, race, or gender, as is traditional). They\u2019d do so based on survey questions that measure the Big Five or \u201cOCEAN\u201d personality traits commonly used in psychology research \u2014 Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. (You can take the test here.) \n\nThey\u2019d also use modeling to extrapolate the personalities of people they didn\u2019t directly survey. Then, SCL claimed, they could tailor messaging to better target and persuade voters based on their particular personalities. This, they said, was the future of politics.\n\nThe Mercers agreed to provide $15 million for this project. To do so, they set up a new company mostly owned by Robert Mercer, with SCL Group executive Alexander Nix as the CEO. It would be named Cambridge Analytica (a name reportedly provided by Bannon, who would also have a stake in the company and serve as a vice president). But according to the New York Times, Cambridge was \u201ceffectively a shell,\u201d and all its contract work would be carried out by the SCL Group.\n\nAt the core of this new effort would be a vast amount of data that an outside researcher harvested from tens of millions of people\u2019s Facebook profiles \u2014 an effort Cambridge Analytica reportedly funded to the tune of $7 million. The data was matched with other records to construct personality profiles on millions of American voters, in hopes that Cambridge could better target them with customized political messaging.\n\nIn GOP political consulting circles, Cambridge soon gained a reputation as the Mercers\u2019 somewhat odd pet project. The wealthy hedge fund family would reportedly demand candidates hire Cambridge if they wanted Mercer money. And after working on various low-profile GOP political efforts in 2014, Cambridge landed a major job with a Mercer-funded Super PAC supporting Ted Cruz\u2019s presidential candidacy. But the gig went poorly \u2014 the Cruz team claimed Cambridge\u2019s data was worthless and fought with them over money, according to a later New York Times report.\n\nCambridge beefed up Donald Trump\u2019s digital operation for the 2016 general election\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Trump on the campaign trail in October 2016.\n      \n      \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nEventually, Donald Trump emerged as the GOP nominee-in-waiting. And though Bannon was still a few months away from officially joining the Trump campaign, he made the introduction between Cambridge and Trump\u2019s team. (Bannon owned a stake in Cambridge and was being paid by it at the time.) Various reports name Trump staffers Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner, and Brad Parscale as involved in the decision to bring Cambridge on board, and on June 23, 2016, the campaign signed a contract with the firm.\n\nTrump\u2019s digital team was run by Brad Parscale out of an office in San Antonio, Texas, and Cambridge sent along 13 people to work with them there, Wired reported. \n\nWhat did they do? Well, in the new Channel 4 News report, Cambridge CEO Alexander Nix brags to someone he thought was a prospective client that \u201cwe did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign, and our data informed all the strategy\u201d (though he could be inflating the company\u2019s role).\n\nHowever, one thing that both Trump aides and Cambridge staffers have since claimed the company did not do for Trump is use the firm\u2019s fancy, futuristic-sounding \u201cpsychographic\u201d personality modeling. People from both camps have said, in public statements and to reporters, that the Trump campaign chose to use the RNC\u2019s data file as its raw data, not those tens of millions of personal profiles matched with Facebook data that Cambridge obtained.\n\nIf this is true, Cambridge\u2019s work for Trump resembled less sexy, more traditional political consulting. More specifically:\n\n\nCambridge oversaw a $5 million placement of TV ads \u2014 though the Times reports that the Trump campaign was unhappy with the results, since Cambridge ended up paying for ads on cable channels in Washington, DC.\nThe firm worked on targeting digital ads and online fundraising.\nThey did polling of swing states.\n\nIn the end, FEC filings show that the Trump campaign paid Cambridge $5.9 million over the rest of the campaign, and the Wall Street Journal reported that $3 million more went to Cambridge through Brad Parscale\u2019s firm.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump\u2019s digital operation was generally thought to be a joke, and Clinton\u2019s team was portrayed as the ingenious data wizards with incredible algorithms. But after Clinton\u2019s shocking loss, people naturally searched for explanations \u2014 and Cambridge Analytica was willing and eager to take credit. Not everyone bought it, though \u2014 the Spectator\u2019s Paul Wood asked \u201cAre Cambridge Analytica brilliant scientists or snake-oil salesmen?\u201d in December 2016.\n\nCambridge got its Facebook data through questionable means\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n      \n      \n        Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nOf late, though, Cambridge has faced a new round of scrutiny over just how it got all that Facebook data in the first place \u2014 and Facebook, too, is facing major questions about what happened.\n\nThe Guardian actually first broke much of this story all the way back in December 2015, when Cambridge was still backing Ted Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign. But last week, a former Cambridge employee, Christopher Wylie, provided documents and first-person testimony in both a Times story (by Matthew Rosenberg, Nick Confessore, and Carole Cadwalladr) and an Observer story (by Cadwalladr) laying out, in far more detail, exactly what happened.\n\n\nAleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic at Cambridge University, got permission from Facebook to pull data via an app he created \u2014 but he reportedly claimed he\u2019d use this data only for academic purposes, not commercial ones.\nKogan\u2019s app, \u201cthisismydigitallife,\u201d was a personality quiz Facebook users could take. However, to take the quiz, users had to consent to give the app access to their and their friends\u2019 Facebook profiles. \nMore than 270,000 people used the app and took the quiz. However, because they consented to give the app access to their friends\u2019 profiles, too, Kogan ended up collecting data from far more \u2014 50 million raw profiles, of which about 30 million could be matched with other records that helped identify people.\nCambridge Analytica was the brains behind Kogan\u2019s operation and ended up spending about $7 million on this data, Wylie told the Observer. (It also seems that Bannon gave the new company its name because of all this, since Kogan worked at Cambridge University.)\nFacebook says it learned that Kogan had violated their rules by passing on the information to third parties in 2015 and that it subsequently got assurances from Kogan and Cambridge that they deleted the data they\u2019d collected. However, a former Cambridge employee told the Times that \u201che had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes\u201d of that data still on the company\u2019s servers.\n\nBoth Facebook and Cambridge have faced enormous criticism for all this, and as the news was about to break, Facebook announced it would suspend Cambridge, SCL Group, Kogan, and Wylie from its platform. \n\nHowever, despite Wylie\u2019s dramatic claims that he and Cambridge \u201cbroke Facebook,\u201d the harvesting of such data, even from users\u2019 friends who didn\u2019t clearly consent, does seem to have been clearly allowed by Facebook at the time, and many app developers had similar practices. Indeed, Zeynep Tufekci argues that this is an \u201call-too-natural consequence of Facebook\u2019s business model,\u201d since the company makes money \u201cby profiling us and then selling our attention to advertisers, political actors and others.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether any laws were broken here \u2014 Andrew Keane Woods runs down some possibilities at Lawfare \u2014 but regulators in the US and the UK both say they\u2019re looking into the matter. \n\nImportantly, it hasn\u2019t been shown Cambridge used this Facebook profile info in its work for the Trump campaign. (Wylie left the firm in late 2014, so he can\u2019t speak to that.)\n\nAlso, apropos of nothing, Aleksandr Kogan at one point changed his name to \u201cDr. Spectre,\u201d but then changed it back.\n\nCambridge\u2019s CEO bragged about doing shady stuff to someone he thought was a potential client\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        A screencap of the Channel 4 News report in which CEO Alexander Nix is surreptitiously taped bragging about \u201cdirty tricks\u201d tactics.\n      \n      \n        Channel 4 News\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nShortly after Wylie came forward publicly, Channel 4 News in the UK began to publish a series that was the result of a four-month investigation it conducted into Cambridge Analytica.\n\nChannel 4 got a reporter to pose as a wealthy Sri Lankan interested in influencing politics in his home country \u2014 and secretly taped Cambridge executives, including eventually CEO Alexander Nix, as they pitched their services to him in a series of meetings.\n\nIt was Nix, hoping to close the deal, who said the most attention-getting things. He said the company operates \u201cin the shadows\u201d and that he looks forward \u201cto building a very long-term and secretive relationship with you.\u201d He said that his company could have an operative try to videotape a politician they want to discredit accepting a bribe. \u201cThey will offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance,\u201d Nix said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras.\u201d\n\nAnother possibility, Nix continued, was to \u201csend some girls around to the candidate\u2019s house \u2014 we have lots of history of things.\u201d He elaborated, \u201cWe could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us,\u201d since they\u2019re \u201cvery beautiful.\u201d However, he did go on to say, \u201cPlease don\u2019t pay too much attention to what I\u2019m saying because I\u2019m just giving you examples of what can be done and what, what has been done.\u201d Nix also told the supposed prospective client that he uses an email service called ProtonMail and sets it to delete all his mail two hours after it\u2019s read, so there will be no \u201cpaper trail.\u201d\n\nAs the Atlantic\u2019s David Graham notes, dirty tricks like these don\u2019t really have anything to do with big data or psychographic personality profiling. They make Cambridge sound rather more like an ordinary political consulting firm from the shadier side of the business. In any case, Nix\u2019s comments to Channel 4 have created enough of an uproar that Cambridge said Tuesday it\u2019s suspending him pending an investigation. (What that means for Nix\u2019s position at SCL Group is not yet clear.)\n\nCambridge Analytica\u2019s CEO also reached out to Julian Assange in search of hacked Democratic emails\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, in May 2017.\n      \n      \n        Jack Taylor/Getty\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nYet the new reports aren\u2019t the only reason Cambridge is under scrutiny. One of the central focuses of special counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation is whether anyone on Trump\u2019s team had inside knowledge about or played any role in the hacking and leaking of prominent Democrats\u2019 emails in 2016.\n\nAnd we learned last year, via reporting from the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Rebecca Ballhaus, that Nix \u2014 Cambridge\u2019s CEO \u2014 had contacted Julian Assange of WikiLeaks about just that topic, both just before and after Cambridge signed on with the Trump campaign.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence yet that Nix\u2019s contacts with Assange actually led to anything. But here\u2019s the timeline of what we know happened:\n\n\nIn mid-May 2016, Cambridge began discussions with Trump\u2019s team about work for the campaign.\nOn June 12, 2016, WikiLeaks\u2019s Julian Assange publicly claimed to have \u201cupcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton,\u201d which he specified were \u201cemails.\u201d\nNix says that it was after he saw this report, in \u201cearly June,\u201d that he reached out to Assange to ask if he could get an advance look at those emails. He says that Assange turned him down.\nAt some point that same month, Cambridge board member Rebekah Mercer talked with an associate about whether they should try to somehow obtain Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails, a source told Ballhaus. (Clinton deleted about 33,000 emails, about half of the total on her server, rather than turn them over to the government because she said they were personal rather than work-related.) Ballhaus\u2019s source claimed Mercer decided not to go through with this.\nOn June 13, 2016, Cambridge sent a proposed contract to Trump\u2019s team.\nOn July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks began posting hacked DNC emails.\nOn June 23, 2016, the Trump campaign signed a contract with Cambridge to do digital work.\nIn August 2016, Nix emailed Mercer and other Cambridge employees and said that he\u2019d recently reached out to Assange again, and offered to help better organize the WikiLeaks-posted DNC emails, but hadn\u2019t yet heard back.\n\nBoth Nix and Assange have said, however, that these overtures never went anywhere. No evidence has emerged to disprove them. Still, this is yet another addition to the list of Trump associates who betrayed at least some interest in getting involved in the email hackings (and we should keep in mind that the email hackings themselves were a crime).\n\nThere have been also questions about whether Trump\u2019s data operation worked with Russia\nFinally, separately from Nix\u2019s contacts with Assange, there have been questions for months about whether the Trump campaign\u2019s data operation collaborated with Russian digital efforts to boost Trump or hurt Clinton in some way.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in December that Mueller had requested Cambridge turn over the emails of any of its employees who worked on Trump\u2019s campaign. And anonymously sourced reports from McClatchy and Vanity Fair, among others, have said Mueller\u2019s team is looking into whether Trump\u2019s digital operation provided information to Russians to help them determine which American voters to target with their own digital efforts. \n\nAs of now, there is no evidence that this occurred, and Mueller\u2019s recent indictment of several Russian individuals and companies for conspiring to interfere with the election through their propaganda work makes no allegations that anyone on Trump\u2019s team was aware of their activities.\n\nBut since Cambridge was a major part of Trump\u2019s digital operation, there are some questions about them and their own ties to Russia.\n\n\n The firm has also claimed to have done work in Russia and Ukraine in the past. \nAleksandr Kogan, who provided that Facebook data, is also an associate professor at St. Petersburg University and got a grant from the Russian government to research social networks. \nCambridge at one point tried to land business from the Russian oil and gas company Lukoil.\nDays after WikiLeaks began posting the DNC emails and at the height of the 2016 campaign, Nix was photographed on a polo field with the Russian ambassador to the United Kingdom, according to Mother Jones.\n\nAnother odd note is that, toward the end of the campaign, Trump foreign policy adviser Michael Flynn signed on to do consulting for the SCL Group. It is not clear what, if anything, Flynn did for them. However, and perhaps unrelatedly, some reports have suggested that Flynn was involved in yet another apparent effort to obtain Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails from Russian hackers in 2016, undertaken by Peter Smith, a Republican consultant unconnected to the Trump campaign. (Flynn has since become a cooperating witness for Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.)\n\nMeanwhile, many politicos think Cambridge is full of hot air\nLast but not least, another angle to all this is that as unsettling as Cambridge\u2019s own claims about its futuristic capabilities may sound \u2014 \u201cI made Steve Bannon\u2019s psychological warfare tool,\u201d the Observer\u2019s headline thundered, quoting Christopher Wylie \u2014 many Republican political professionals who\u2019ve worked with the firm have generally derided the quality of its work.\n\nTake these tweets from three well-connected political reporters:\n\n\n\nBIGGEST SECRET ABOUT CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA: It was ( is) an overpriced service that delivered little value to the TRUMP campaign,  the other campaigns  PACs that retained it \u2014 most of which hired the firm because it was seen as a prerequisite for receiving $$$ from the MERCERS.\n\u2014 Kenneth P.

The race stretched into Wednesday afternoon, when Democrat Conor Lamb, the 33-year-old former Marine, officially won the race in a stunning upset. Pennsylvania law does not mandate a recount in district-level elections. \n\nYet Ryan said he wasn\u2019t surprised by the results. Lamb ran as a \u201cconservative,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe candidate who is going to win this race is the candidate who ran as a pro-life, pro-gun, anti-Nancy Pelosi, conservative,\u201d Ryan said at his weekly press conference in the Capitol.\n\nIt\u2019s one of a long list of justifications Republicans have rattled off to explain Saccone\u2019s performance: from deriding Saccone\u2019s electability to saying the Pennsylvania 18th District was a Democratic district in the first place (it\u2019s not), or that eventually voters would see the benefits of their economic policy.\n\nPennsylvania uncovered an uncomfortable reality for Republicans, who tried to push tax cuts in this race, with outside groups spending more than $7 million largely on that message. Lamb, as moderate as he was, didn\u2019t try to mirror Republicans on their agenda.\n\nI tried to ask Ryan about this Wednesday morning: How can it be that tax cuts are a winning message and that Conor Lamb, who ran against the GOP tax law, is winning because he was a \u201cconservative\u201d?\n\nRyan, growing tired at this line of questioning, cut me off and refused to answer.\n\nThe bottom line is is that the Republican spin is a show of some of the GOP\u2019s biggest vulnerabilities headed into the 2018 midterm election. Pennsylvania was an early test of GOP messaging and recruitment, and on both fronts they were slammed with a wave of Democratic enthusiasm.\n\nRepublicans have a lot of excuses for Pennsylvania\nIt\u2019s too early to make \u201csweeping predictions\u201d about the 2018 midterm election, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA), who chairs the House Republican conference warned reporters at the start of her weekly press conference Wednesday morning.\n\nRepublicans were ready to ward off any insinuation that the Pennsylvania special election was a bad omen for November.\n\nGOP staffers said Saccone was a bad candidate, despite the 60-year old state legislator and military veteran seemingly having a similar track record to many elected Republicans. \n\nStrategists pointed out that he was an unorganized campaigner who failed to adequately fundraise. \n\n\u201cFor any House GOP incumbents who have been coasting along and getting out-raised by their [Democratic] opponents, tonight should be a serious wake-up call no matter what happens,\u201d Brian Walsh, a Republican strategist tweeted. \u201cCampaigns matter.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Lamb\u2019s campaign outspent Saccone\u2019s and had a much more robust fundraising effort. But money wasn\u2019t an issue for the Republican candidate, who saw more than $7 million spent in his name from a variety of outside groups. \n\nMajority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy noted that the district had more registered Democrats than Republicans. The district has historically trended Republican for many years. Democrats didn\u2019t even challenge the Republican seat in 2014 and 2016.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers made sure to say the country hadn\u2019t yet experienced the \u201cfull momentum of tax reform.\u201d Once the voters truly see what the corporate tax cuts could do for them, the tide would change, she said.\n\nAnd as for Lamb, Ryan made his point very clear: He could have been the Republican.\n\nThe great contradiction in Republican\u2019s message\nRepublicans have hitched their cart to tax cuts. \n\nThe GOP tax bill loomed large over Saccone\u2019s campaign. Republicans groups spent millions trying to sell the policy to the district\u2019s Republican voters. Trump came to the district early to tout the policy\u2019s successes.\n\nIt didn\u2019t stick. In the final weeks, pro-Saccone advertising began focusing largely on immigration, crime, and tying Lamb to Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi \u2014 who Republicans have long used as the Democratic boogeywoman.\n\nNow, as the party watches Saccone fall behind, Republicans have changed their tune on one front. Lamb is no longer a Pelosi-liberal. He might as well have been a \u201cconservative\u201d Republican, Ryan said.\n\nPut together, these Republican messages raise a major contradiction.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that Lamb ran on a more moderate Democratic platform. He has shied away from criticizing Trump and said he would not support Pelosi for speaker. He came out against an assault weapons ban but supports stronger background check laws. \n\nHe is personally pro-life but supports the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to legalize abortion. He does not support a ban on abortions at 20 weeks. In other words, on policy, Lamb is a pro-choice Democrat. \n\nThe clear divisions between Lamb and the Republicans land on the core pillars of the Republican agenda. Lamb is opposed to repealing Obamacare and called the GOP tax bill a \u201cgiveaway\u201d to the wealthy.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t need to add a penny to our debt to have the tax cut for our working and middle-class people,\u201d Lamb said at a debate, butting heads with Saccone.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Zeeshan Aleem", "body": "Former White House strategist Steve Bannon has been refusing to answer lawmakers\u2019 questions about the Trump-Russia investigation \u2014 and they\u2019re so tired of it that they\u2019re considering holding him in contempt of Congress. \nThe House Intelligence committee could vote on whether or not to discipline Bannon as early as Monday. If lawmakers vote yes, there are three different kinds of contempt charges they could use. \nFirst, there\u2019s \u201cinherent contempt\u201d \u2014 which could result in Bannon being held in Congress\u2019s very own jail if he refuses to comply with their subpoena. But according to Andy Wright, a former White House lawyer in the Obama administration, that kind of measure hasn\u2019t been used in around a century and is unlikely to be taken up now.\nThere\u2019s also \u201ccriminal contempt,\u201d which means that Congress could turn to the Department of Justice to prosecute Bannon for refusing to comply with their subpoena. But that route also seems unlikely, since the Department of Justice has traditionally resisted prosecuting executive branch officials when they\u2019re following the president\u2019s orders.\nAnd finally, there\u2019s \u201ccivil contempt,\u201d a rare but occasionally used technique for obtaining information. Wright sees it as the most likely out of the three.\nIf Congress chooses the third, it would have to get a judicial order from a federal court to uphold the demand that Bannon testify. If the court decides that Congress is right, it could issue an order requiring the former White House strategist to testify \u2014 and arrest him for failing to follow that order. \nThe court could keep Bannon detained in jail until he agrees to cooperate with the order. And crucially, Wright says, Trump wouldn\u2019t be able to pardon Bannon if he was in jail for that reason.\nLawmakers are angry about Bannon\u2019s refusal to cooperate\nLawmakers are growing deeply impatient with Bannon\u2019s stonewalling on the Trump-Russia investigation.\nDuring a four-hour closed-door meeting with the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, Bannon refused to comply with most lawmakers\u2019 questions, except for 25 that had been prescreened by the White House. Bannon missed previously scheduled hearings and has now refused to answer questions three times in a row. \nMembers of Congress are angered by his behavior; they\u2019re trying to obtain vital information required for understanding the connections between Trump\u2019s affiliates and Russia. The House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation is running in parallel to separate investigations by the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Department of Justice.\nAfter Thursday\u2019s session, Rep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said he was \u201cnot okay\u201d with Bannon\u2019s refusal to cooperate with questions.\nBannon has repeatedly invoked executive privilege to justify his refusal to fully cooperate with the House probe \u2014 a legal claim the president can use to protect the confidentiality of his conversations, and that at times can apply to his staff. Some members of the committee were skeptical.\n\u201cThe breadth of that claim of executive privilege is breathtaking and insupportable and indeed, at times, it was laughable,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters Thursday.\nSome experts say that the White House\u2019s sweeping use of executive privilege to get its former staffers to block inquiries from lawmakers appears to be entering unprecedented legal territory. \n\u201cExecutive privilege is an amorphous concept,\u201d William Banks, a professor at the Syracuse University College of Law and a former special counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, told the Washington Times in January. \u201cIt has never been tested the way it could soon be tested.\u201d\nLawmakers want to force Bannon to take them seriously\nAnalysts say Bannon appears to be complying more with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia than with the House Intelligence Committee.\nAccording to NBC News, Bannon spent some 20 hours in conversations with Mueller\u2019s team this week. \nSome members of the House Intelligence committee reportedly believe Bannon is cooperating more with Mueller, who can more easily enforce subpoenas by threatening to apply criminal charges than lawmakers can.\nBannon\u2019s recent behavior has managed to do something exceedingly rare: unite Republicans and Democrats on the committee.\n\u201cAt some point, Congress\u2019s institutional interests outweigh their partisan interests,\u201d Wright told me. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for the committee\u2019s authority to look like it\u2019s toothless.\u201d\nHolding Bannon in contempt could be a way for the House committee to show that\u2019s not the case.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Alex Ward", "body": "Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis is about to face one of his biggest challenges since joining the Trump administration: handling incoming National Security Adviser John Bolton.\n\nMattis and Bolton are diametrically opposed on the two biggest national security issues facing the United States \u2014 North Korea and Iran. Mattis wants to keep the US in the Iran nuclear deal; Bolton previously advocated for bombing the country and removing the US from the agreement. And Mattis argues diplomacy is the best way to curb Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program, while Bolton warns against negotiations and last month advocated for striking North Korea.\n\nBut it gets worse for Mattis. Experts tell me Bolton is a seasoned bureaucratic infighter who has the skills to press forcefully for his views \u2014 and that could keep Trump from hearing Mattis\u2019s advice. \u201cThere is an open question about whether he will allow multiple views to be aired in front of the president,\u201d Evelyn Farkas, a former senior Pentagon official, told me. \u201cHis reputation is not good when it comes to how he has treated his colleagues in the past.\u201d \n\nAnd Mattis has already lost some leverage within Trump\u2019s team. President Donald Trump fired a key Mattis ally, Rex Tillerson, as his secretary of state two weeks ago, and it\u2019s rumored Chief of Staff John Kelly may soon head out the door. Mattis helped Kelly remove outgoing National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, in part because they fought over how to deal with North Korea. But now, ironically, Mattis has to contend with an even more pugnacious rival in the White House.\n\n\u201cI expect even more internal drama and choppy waters ahead for the Pentagon,\u201d Derek Chollet, a former top National Security Council (NSC) and Pentagon official, told me. \u201cThe tensions that existed with the NSC under McMaster are likely going to get exponentially worse.\u201d\n\nMattis has faced a lot of obstacles in his storied military and brief political career, but Bolton\u2019s appointment ranks high among them.\n\n\u201cThis will be a huge test for Mattis,\u201d Chollet told me. \n\nAdvantage: Bolton\nMatthew Waxman, a former senior official in the George W. Bush administration, wrote in Lawfare on Friday about why Bolton could be a formidable force in his new role.\n\n\u201cYes, Bolton is militantly aggressive about wielding American military and economic power,\u201d Waxman says, \u201c[b]ut what I saw in him also was an operator who was relentlessly effective in implementing \u2014 or stymying \u2014 policy, at least in the short term.\u201d It\u2019s worth recalling that Bolton learned from the best: He\u2019s a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of former Vice President Dick Cheney, a master bureaucratic pugilist.\n\nBolton also spent years in Republican administrations learning the ins and out of how to navigate the US capital. In his book Surrender Is Not an Option, he spends page after page self-servingly detailing his contempt for government agencies and career officials, and how he eventually outsmarted them all to make them adopt his points of view. (However, he is honest about how the Bush administration marginalized him while he served as the ambassador to the UN, preventing him from severing America\u2019s ties to the diplomatic body.)\n\nBolton has another big advantage over Mattis: He will likely hold multiple Oval Office meetings each day with Trump to discuss key issues from North Korea to Iran to Syria to Afghanistan. That will help him crowd out dissenting voices, including Mattis\u2019s.\n\nMattis, meanwhile, has very limited political experience. Joining Trump\u2019s Cabinet is his first foray into setting American foreign policy or navigating official Washington. That said, Mattis retired as a four-star general, which means he proved he can fight a good bureaucratic battle on his own \u2014 troops don\u2019t achieve four stars unless they know how to deal with Washington\u2019s egos.\n\n\u201cSecretary Mattis will work well with anyone the president selects for his team,\u201d Dana White, the Pentagon\u2019s top spokesperson, told me.\n\nBut Mattis famously formed a united front with Tillerson to push back against the president\u2019s worst foreign policy impulses \u2014 angering Trump along the way \u2014 and lost again and again. Here\u2019s just one example: Trump still plans to move the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem over Mattis\u2019s and Tillerson\u2019s objections.\n\nMattis remains in Trump\u2019s good graces, though, and there is no indication the secretary will leave the administration any time soon. Yet Bolton will likely form a mind meld with the president right away \u2014 they share similarly hawkish views \u2014 and try to bend the national security bureaucracy to his liking.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Mattis and Bolton\u2019s first skirmish may come sooner than you think.\n\nThe first potential Mattis-Bolton showdown is just weeks away\nTrump brought in Bolton now in part to have his national security team set ahead of two critical events: the decision about whether to remove the US from the Iran deal, and a potential summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nBolton is crystal clear about his feelings toward both countries. \u201cBolton\u2019s strong policy views are well-known, and he will be a forceful proponent of them in the Situation Room,\u201d William Inboden, a top NSC staffer in the George W. Bush administration, told me. \n\nDuring the early months of the Trump administration, then-White House senior strategist Steve Bannon approached Bolton as part of a plan to get around Cabinet members, like Mattis, who opposed withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nBolton then drafted a five-page memo detailing his proposal for tearing up the deal, which he then published in the National Review after Bannon departed the White House.\n\nAnd on February 28, Bolton published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal arguing that the US needed to solve the nuclear standoff with North Korea by force. \n\n\u201cPre-emption opponents argue that action is not justified because Pyongyang does not constitute an \u2018imminent threat.\u2019 They are wrong,\u201d Bolton wrote. \u201cIt is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current \u2018necessity\u2019 posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons by striking first.\u201d\n\nAs of now, all signs point to Trump removing the US from the Iran agreement on May 12. The problem is Trump plans to meet with Kim later that month. Breaking America\u2019s commitment to the nuclear deal could make it much harder for the US to have a successful summit with North Korea, experts say.\n\n\u201cIf I were the North Koreans, and Trump pulled out of the deal with Iran, why should I make an agreement?\u201d Frank Rose, a top arms control official at the State Department from 2014 to 2016, told me.\n\nBut that won\u2019t stop Bolton from encouraging Trump to follow his instincts on Iran and possibly scuttle any meeting with Pyongyang.\n\nThe question is if Mattis will be able to contain Bolton\u2019s most dangerous instincts. If he doesn\u2019t, Trump\u2019s best Cabinet member will find himself marginalized when he\u2019s needed most.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Anna North", "body": "The American public might be about to learn a lot more about President Trump\u2019s history with women \u2014 in court. \n\nKaren McDougal, a fitness expert and former Playboy model, filed suit on Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeking the right to speak publicly about an alleged affair between her and Trump. She\u2019s the second woman to file such a suit. Adult film actress Stormy Daniels sued Trump earlier this month.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, a New York Supreme Court judge ruled that a defamation suit filed against Trump by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice, could move forward. Zervos says that Trump sexually assaulted her in 2007.\n\nAs part of Zervos\u2019s suit, her lawyers have subpoenaed all Trump campaign documents dealing with \u201cany woman alleging that Donald J. Trump touched her inappropriately.\u201d The Trump team had sought to block the suit; now that it\u2019s moving forward, they might actually be forced to produce those documents, if they exist.\n\nTuesday\u2019s legal developments move the country that much closer to hearing the full story about Trump\u2019s past, including whether he authorized or had a hand in payoffs to women with whom he had extramarital affairs, and what his campaign knew about allegations of sexual misconduct against him.\n\nThey also chip away at the barriers \u2014 legal and otherwise \u2014 that Trump\u2019s associates appear to have created to keep women from talking about their experiences with the man who is now our president.\n\nKaren McDougal is suing for the right to tell her story about Trump\nIn documents reviewed by Ronan Farrow of the New Yorker, McDougal says she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007. In August 2016, after Trump won the Republican nomination for president, she signed away the rights to her story to American Media Inc. (AMI), the company that publishes the National Enquirer, according to Farrow.\n\nIn exchange, she got $150,000, 45 percent of which went to various middlemen, and was told that AMI would publish 100 fitness columns by her. The deal was apparently an example of a tactic called \u201ccatch and kill,\u201d in which David Pecker, the chair of AMI and a personal friend of Trump\u2019s, would buy the rights to a story only to make sure it never saw the light of day.\n\nBut now McDougal wants to speak out. So she\u2019s suing AMI, arguing that she was misled about the deal. Like Stormy Daniels, she is seeking \u201cdeclaratory relief\u201d \u2014 she wants the court to declare her deal with AMI invalid, which would help her tell her story publicly without fear of legal repercussions.\n\nAccording to Jim Rutenberg of the New York Times, McDougal says in her suit that when she signed the deal, she believed AMI would have to publish her columns \u2014 she later learned it only had \u201cthe right\u201d to publish them. The suit alleges that both McDougal\u2019s lawyer, Keith Davidson, and AMI\u2019s chief content officer, Dylan Howard, pressured McDougal to sign.\n\n\u201cAs A.M.I. and Mr. Davidson pushed her to sign the deal on Aug. 5, Ms. McDougal expressed misgivings,\u201d Rutenberg writes. \u201cBut, her suit says, Mr. Davidson and Mr. Howard argued in an urgent Skype call that the deal to promote her would \u2018kick start and revitalize\u2019 her career, given that she was \u2018old now.\u2019 She was 45.\u201d\n\nMcDougal\u2019s suit also says that Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, was secretly involved in her deal with AMI. Cohen paid $130,000 to Stormy Daniels in October 2016 in exchange for her promise not to speak out about Trump, a payment some say may have been an illegal campaign contribution. \n\nDaniels\u2019s suit is ongoing, and she is reportedly set to appear on 60 Minutes on March 25. McDougal\u2019s suit is sure to increase scrutiny on the president. \n\n\u201cThe lawsuit filed today aims to restore her right to her own voice,\u201d her new lawyer, Peter K. Stris, told the Times.\n\nSummer Zervos\u2019s lawsuit could expose even more allegations \nSummer Zervos\u2019s story about Trump starts around the same time as McDougal\u2019s. In December 2007, she says, she sought a meeting with Trump, hoping he could help her in her career. At the meeting, she says, he kissed her twice without asking; at a second meeting, at the Beverly Hills Hotel, she says he grabbed her breasts and pressed his genitals against her. \n\nZervos began speaking about her experiences publicly in October 2016, after she heard Trump talking about grabbing women \u201cby the pussy\u201d on the Access Hollywood tape. Trump pushed back, saying, \u201cevery woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign,\u201d and of Zervos specifically, \u201cI never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago.\u201d So in January 2017, Zervos sued for defamation \u2014 her suit argues that Trump\u2019s comments about her \u201chave been deeply detrimental to Ms. Zervos\u2019s reputation, honor and dignity.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have been trying to get the case dismissed. The Supreme Court decided in Clinton v. Jones, Paula Jones\u2019s sexual harassment lawsuit against Bill Clinton, that the president can be sued in federal court for \u201cunofficial acts\u201d \u2014 that is, actions committed outside his or her official capacity as president. Trump\u2019s lawyers argued, however, that the president could not be sued for such acts in state court. On Tuesday, a judge rejected that argument, allowing Zervos\u2019s case to go forward.\n\nThat means Trump\u2019s team might have to reveal campaign communications not just about Zervos, but about any woman who has accused Trump of sexual misconduct \u2014 including women who may not have gone public yet. Of course, Trump\u2019s lawyers will probably fight the subpoena \u2014 but on Tuesday, they lost an important battle in their effort to keep the case out of the public eye.\n\nAccounts from McDougal and others over the past few months have suggested a complex edifice built up around Trump \u2014 maintained by friends and lawyers, composed of money and nondisclosure agreements, and intended to protect Trump from having to face the consequences of women speaking publicly about their experiences.

He blasted Trump\u2019s approach to trade with a quick column titled \u201cTariffs Are Taxes,\u201d which makes the accurate point that tariffs are taxes and thus dogmatically anti-tax conservatives should oppose them. \n\nTrump, rather famously, likes to watch many hours of television each day and believes that cable television is a good way to gather information, so it\u2019s natural that Kudlow would seem to him to be an authority on economic matters. Kudlow is also unquestionably \u201cgood on television\u201d and not necessarily a highly principled debater, so to the extent that Trump places a high priority on recruiting team members who will be effective surrogates on cable chat shows, Kudlow is likely to do a good job. \n\nHis ability to actually provide high-quality economic policy advice to the president seems more questionable. The good news is that far and away the most consequential economic policy decision of Trump\u2019s term \u2014 the selection of a Federal Reserve Chair \u2014 has already been made, and Trump ultimately came up with a well-qualified pick with sound views.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matthew Yglesias", "body": "Democrats held on to an open state Senate seat in Minnesota Monday night while the GOP held on to an open seat in the state\u2019s lower House, with Democratic candidates in both cases outperforming Hillary Clinton in districts that Donald Trump carried. \nAs neither seat is changing partisan hands, the direct implications of the races are minimal \u2014 Karla Bigham will hold the Senate seat for Democrats while Jeremy Munson won the House race \u2014 and everything will proceed as normal. \nBut they do continue to indicate a national political environment that\u2019s favorable to Democrats in the upcoming 2018 congressional elections. Holding the Senate seat raises the prospect that Democrats could seize a majority there, pending the outcome of some legal wrangling. \nBoth seats were vacant because incumbents resigned under a cloud of sexual misconduct allegations, which is just one of the ways Minnesota is an interesting state in terms of our current politics. \nHillary Clinton carried it in 2016, but like the rest of the Midwest, it tilted strongly in Trump\u2019s direction relative to where it had been in 2012. Both of the districts that voted tonight followed that basic pattern. House District 23B voted by a narrow 3-point margin for Mitt Romney, but Trump won it in a 27-point landslide. Obama carried Senate District 54 by a fairly comfortable 7-point margin, but Trump eked out a 1-point victory. \nMinnesota has two US Senate elections this November, plus two open House races in seats being vacated by Democratic incumbents in districts Trump won, plus an upscale suburban House district represented by Erik Paulsen (R-MN) that\u2019s considered one of Democrats\u2019 top pickup opportunities. The state\u2019s political trends are of enormous national interest. Tonight\u2019s results carry no guarantees for November, of course, but they seem to indicate that Democrats are succeeding in rolling back recent GOP gains in the state. \nThe whole Minnesota state Senate is now in play\nWith Monday night\u2019s results, Republicans now hold a narrow 34-33 majority in the Minnesota state Senate \u2014 but that majority is at risk. When Sen. Al Franken resigned from the Senate, Gov. Mark Dayton appointed Lt. Gov. Tina Smith (D-MN) to fill the vacancy. That created a vacancy for the lieutenant governor job that, by statute, was automatically filled by state Senate President Michelle Fischbach, a Republican. \nFischbach views her elevation to the lieutenant governorship as essentially a dirty pool play by Minnesota Democrats to create a vacancy, so she has refused to relinquish her state Senate seat. Democrats are suing, arguing that the lieutenant governor can\u2019t also be a state senator and that Minnesota law does not allow Fischbach to refuse her promotion. \nDemocrats\u2019 hopes for securing the majority now rest on winning the lawsuit, creating the vacancy, and then winning the special election. Republicans will continue to control the Minnesota House one way or the other, so the short-term policy consequences here are not especially large. But as Democrats try to make a Trump-era down-ballot recovery, every little bit helps. \nDemocrats are cleaning up in special elections\nAccording to an extremely useful comprehensive spreadsheet compiled by Daily Kos, across 70 special elections in 2017, Democrats ran 10 points ahead of Clinton and 7 points ahead of Obama\u2019s 2012 results. Those numbers have accelerated into 2018. Across 11 races, Democrats are running 23 points ahead of Clinton and 8 points ahead of Obama. \nHistorically speaking, special election results usually are somewhat predictive of midterm general election outcomes, though I don\u2019t think anyone believes it\u2019s realistic for Democrats to obtain a nationwide 23-point swing relative to Clinton\u2019s numbers. \nIt\u2019s particularly interesting that Democratic results thus far show a much larger overperformance relative to Clinton in 2016 than to Obama in 2012. People who\u2019ve crunched the numbers in detail say that\u2019s because some Trump voters really are crossing over to vote for Democrats. \n\n\nJust to push back against the CW, the state legislative special election results so far being more correlated with 2012 than 2016 really implies that a lot of Trump voters must be voting for Democrats https://t.co/p6nbGofahN\u2014 ((David Shor)) (@davidshor) February 7, 2018\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the special elections are already having real-world impact. \nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has decided to leave a number of formerly GOP-held seats vacant rather than schedule special elections his party might lose, national Republicans are pushing the panic button on an upcoming special House election in Pennsylvania, and GOP leadership is letting scandal-plagued Rep. Blake Farenthold stick around in his seat rather than risk a special election.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Dylan Scott", "body": "While there weren\u2019t any earth-shattering upsets in the Illinois primary election on Tuesday night, there were still more signs of a steady Democratic wave building in the fall.\n\nTurnout among Democratic voters was up substantially over the past few midterm election cycles, according to several early reports, and more Republican voters stayed home. That is the recipe for Democrats to make big gains in the House and possibly the Senate this fall.\n\nAccording to Politico\u2019s Natasha Korecki, Democratic turnout in Illinois was up 300 percent versus 2014 and up 30 percent versus 2010, the last midterm cycle where there was a competitive Democratic gubernatorial primary. Meanwhile, Republican turnout dropped by 30 percent from 2014, when there was also a well-contested GOP governor\u2019s race.\n\nThat has been the story of 2018 so far. As the Washington Post\u2019s Philip Bump wrote in this great piece, Democrats have performed so strongly in the various special and primary elections because they have turned out at levels much closer to presidential years than their Republican counterparts.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Washington Post\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nIn the Pennsylvania 18th District special election, Democrat Conor Lamb won 78 percent as many votes as Hillary Clinton did in 2016; his Republican opponent won only 52 percent of President Donald Trump\u2019s vote share. In Texas, Democratic turnout for the state\u2019s primary election was up 98 percent, while the GOP gained only 16 percent, as Vox\u2019s Rachel Wolfe previously noted.\n\nThese turnout/enthusiasm gaps go hand in hand with wave elections \u2014 especially in midterms, when the party out of power tends to be motivated to come out and vote, while the party in power is less enthused. We saw a similar gap in 2006 (when Democrats took back both chambers of Congress) and in 2010 (when Republicans reversed the massive Democratic gains in the House of the previous election cycles).\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Pew Research Center\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nSo Illinois, a more conventionally blue state, is another good sign for Democrats.

It might have been the wrong choice then, but a swing back closer to it is the right approach now, especially on Trump and corruption. \n\nTrump\u2019s exploitation of loopholes in American conflict of interest law, after all, is a policy issue. And with the economy doing fine and America\u2019s low-key drone wars not directly impacting most voters, it\u2019s clear that for better or worse the central political issue in American politics is Trump himself.\n\nThis is, on some level, obvious. Yet Democrats feel so burned by Clinton\u2019s missteps that they risk overcorrecting. \u201cYou cannot just run against Donald Trump,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned his co-partisans in a February speech in Kentucky. \n\nOutside voices, in particular, keep urging Democrats not to fall too in love with the Trump-Russia issue even while Democratic strategists themselves keep worrying that Democrats will fall too in love with the Trump-Russia issue. Yet potential collusion with the Russians is itself just one element in a vast nesting doll of shady dealings and opaque finances that congressional Republicans are helping Trump keep under wraps. \n\nAnd while personal corruption alone is never enough to entirely sap a demagogue\u2019s political appeal to his core followers (just ask Silvio Berlusconi, currently enjoying yet another comeback in Italy, or American proto-Trumps like George Wallace or Buddy Cianci), the basic fact that Trump is on the take in outrageous ways deserves a higher profile in American partisan politics and will serve as a strong motivating line and unifying theme. \n\nBeyond that, the levels of self-dealing Trump is enmeshed in are something no Republican Congress member would have defended as recently as two years ago and something that all Democrats can agree is bad despite their own internal ideological differences. Best of all, it\u2019s something (unlike free college or Medicare-for-all or an assault weapons ban) they can actually take action on by seizing a majority in the House of Representatives. \n\nDonald Trump is profiting off the presidency\nThe potential for serious corruption was always implicit in Trump\u2019s presidential bid. We have had wealthy presidents before. But the Bushes, Kennedys, and Roosevelts were heirs to large, diversified fortunes consisting of stocks and bonds that could be placed into blind trusts in relatively straightforward ways. \n\nBarack Obama just owned index funds. Jimmy Carter sold his peanut farm to avoid placing himself in the situation where the president was also the owner/manager of an ongoing business enterprise. Trump never committed to liquidating the Trump business empire, which meant the country would find itself in an unprecedented situation fraught with peril.\n\nBut he brushed off these concerns with a range of arguments that critical masses of voters evidently found persuasive. He admitted that he\u2019d been greedy his whole life, but said that as president, \u201cI want to be greedy for the United States.\u201d He promised to separate himself from his businesses and put his assets in a blind trust. \n\nHe said he would put forward a tax plan that would cost him a \u201cfortune\u201d and bragged that as a wealthy business owner he bought and sold politicians, but as a politician he\u2019d be too rich to be bought. \n\nThis shtick became sufficiently embedded in the conventional wisdom around Trump that it even persuaded some prominent leftists who by no means actually agreed with the substance of Trump\u2019s agenda. \n\n\n\nBrother Bernie and Brother Trump are authentic human beings in stark contrast to their donor-driven opponents.\n\u2014 Cornel West (@CornelWest) August 25, 2015\n\n\n\n\nThe reality of Trump\u2019s presidency has been just the reverse. \n\nThere is nothing blind about his finances \u2014 his business empire is merely managed on a day-to-day basis by his adult sons, with whom he is in regular contact and who also work as leading members of his political operation. \n\nHis daughter and son-in-law serve as high-ranking officials in the White House, he operates a hotel in the nation\u2019s capital that serves as an informal headquarters for his administration, and he spends a majority of his weekends at his private resorts in Florida, Virginia, and New Jersey. \n\nSome of the grifting that results from this is almost comical, as in the periodic stories about the Secret Service spending thousands of dollars at a time renting golf carts from clubs that the president owns. \n\nBut lining his pockets with vast sums of public money is the least of the problems with Trump\u2019s conduct in this regard. The real issue is that by joining one of Trump\u2019s private clubs, wealthy individuals are putting cash directly in the president\u2019s pocket while also gaining access to him. Trump seems to regularly \u2014 and quite openly \u2014 poll Mar-a-Lago members for their thoughts on the issues of the day. But it\u2019s also an opportunity for more subtle lobbying in unprecedented ways.\n\nTrump\u2019s policymaking is riven with conflicts of interest\nRepublicans are, in a curious way, often less vulnerable to standard money-in-politics corruption narratives. There\u2019s always a solid baseline case that the reason the party of business and small government is making business-friendly regulatory decisions is ideological rather than pecuniary. \n\nTrump\u2019s regressive tax bill, for example, has almost certainly been a huge financial windfall to his club members. But to suggest a corrupt motive for a Republican president to push a regressive tax bill ignores the fact that all Republican politicians for the past couple of generations have pushed regressive tax bills. That Trump used to promise that he would raise taxes on the rich only to flip-flop later is striking, but ultimately not evidence of corruption.\n\nNot everything the administration does is so cut-and-dried. They proposed a bailout of the coal industry that so flagrantly violated free market principles, for example, that Trump\u2019s own appointees at the Federal Electrical Regulatory Commission ended up vetoing it. Trump\u2019s affinity for coal is, of course, well known. But the fact that the National Mining Association cut a big check to the Trump International Hotel in October can\u2019t have hurt. \n\nThe White House is also actively considering a proposal from the Commerce Department to impose stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. This idea is apparently hotly opposed by most of Trump\u2019s foreign and economic policy advisers. Yet as the administration deliberates, the fact that the Metals Service Center Institute, a trade group that favors anti-import measures, held last year\u2019s annual confab at the Trump Doral resort in Miami may play a role. \n\nThese examples, of course, are drawn from what\u2019s publicly known based on trade groups\u2019 formally announced events. The basic arrangement through which trade associations, political campaigns, and others seeking to curry favor with the president announce major events at Trump properties is obviously corrupt. But in any situation, the most corrupt behavior will be what\u2019s taking place in secret. \n\nWhat we don\u2019t know can hurt us\nThe governments of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Turkey are on the list of foreign powers that have held parties or conferences at Trump clubs and hotels. And though Trump promised that his family company would stop doing deals abroad during his presidency, Donald Trump Jr. recently took a shockingly corrupt trip to India, where he openly mixed his roles as a government spokesperson and as a salesperson. \n\nBut the greater danger is that the same channels through which detectable flows of money travel can also be used for secret payments. \n\nPoliticians have been bribed in the past, of course. But traditionally, to pull it off requires a level of subterfuge that is itself illegal and courts detection. Bribe money cannot be reported as such to the IRS, but hidden untaxed income \u2014 the proverbial cash in the freezer \u2014 has a way of getting you caught. \n\nTrump owns dozens of legitimate businesses, however, so bribe payments can be duly reported to the IRS as hotel rentals or real estate investments or whatever else. And he\u2019s broken with decades of precedent by declining to make his tax returns available to the public, while all his financial disclosure forms reveal is that he owns a lot of shell companies named after himself. \n\nOne of the cardinal rules of American election law is that politicians cannot take campaign funds for personal use. That\u2019s a critical line between a legitimate contribution and an illegitimate bribe. Trump, however, has erased this line. This weekend, he\u2019s expected to pop down to Mar-a-Lago not only to relax and charge the government for use of his golf carts but also to appear at fundraisers for the RNC and his reelection campaign. \n\nFor a politician to personally pocket campaign contributions is a serious crime, but hosting RNC fundraisers at Trump-owned properties completely eviscerates the spirit of those laws. Meanwhile, taking cues from the top, a general tendency toward poor ethics is spiraling down throughout the government.\n\nTrump\u2019s corruption is contaminating everything\nAn early Trump administration controversy that now seems almost quaint came when presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway used a television news appearance from the White House grounds to tout Ivanka Trump\u2019s shoe brand. It wasn\u2019t a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but this kind of low-level legal violation keeps happening in the Trump era, right up to an apparent Hatch Act violation from Jared Kushner as he touted Brad Parscale\u2019s appointment as campaign manager of the Trump 2020 reelection bid.  \n\nBut the list gets longer and contains more serious violations:\n\n\nThese kinds of problems will only grow worse the longer Trump\u2019s own conflicts of interests are permitted to go unabated. Maintaining a high standard of ethical conduct across a sprawling bureaucracy overseen by dozens of political appointees is genuinely challenging, even when elected officials are trying to do it. \n\nWhen the president of the United States doesn\u2019t care about ethics and the predominant attitude of his co-partisans in Congress is that ignorance is bliss, corruption will grow like mushrooms in the shade.\n\nThe GOP is all in on Trump\u2019s corruption\nDemocrats running in 2018 obviously must and will talk about their ideas on health care, jobs, education, environmental regulation, and more. Still, there is fundamentally no escaping the reality that Trump himself is the central political issue of our time. That\u2019s especially the case as long as the economic and military environment remains basically benign.\n\nAnd while there\u2019s plenty about Trump to criticize, not every target out there is actually all that sound. \n\nIn particular, while dwelling on Trump\u2019s racism is probably smart in some parts of the country, it runs the risk of implicitly conceding that Trump is on white America\u2019s side. The truth, however, is that Trump is on Trump\u2019s side. He\u2019s governing fully within the contours of a baseline pro-business agenda that differs from standard Republican fare largely insofar it involves personal enrichment in an unusual way. \n\nAnd, critically, the entire congressional Republican Party is in on it. Republicans can easily distance themselves from Trump\u2019s temperamental issues \u2014 Paul Ryan often sniffily declines to comment on stray Trump tweets \u2014 or dismiss the Russia issue as some kind of \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy. But the basic reality is that the reason we don\u2019t know who is paying Trump is because Republicans in Congress don\u2019t want us to know. \n\nAnd importantly, when Democrats are seeking to motivate their own base to turn out, checking Trump\u2019s corruption is a promise they can actually deliver on in the short term. Trump\u2019s clubs\u2019 financial records can be subpoenas. His tax returns can be released. Current and former government officials can be brought in to testify. \n\nNone of that will eradicate the inherent conflicts of interest involved in the current arrangement \u2014 for that, Trump himself will have to be defeated \u2014 but the veil of secrecy around Trump and money truly can be lifted. But to get there, Democrats will need to elevate the issue out of its current sleeper status and find a way to put it on the front pages.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Jen Kirby", "body": "Thousands of people are expected to rally in Washington, DC, this weekend for a March for Our Lives protest on March 24 to advocate for gun control.

Close to a million students stood up and streamed out of classrooms across the country last week as part of the National School Walkout. The protest honored the victims of the school Parkland shooting one month ago and called on lawmakers to pass gun control legislation. \n\nAnd another national school walkout is planned next month, on April 20, the anniversary of the Columbine shooting. \n\nThe survivors of the Parkland shooting spearheaded the March for Our Lives.

Murdock came up with the idea immediately after the Parkland shooting; she was tired of how numb America was becoming to yet another school shooting. \u201cBut I also just felt really powerless,\u201d Murdock told Vox. So, she thought, \u201cwhat could I do to help other kids who felt really powerless?\u201d\n\nOn the day of the Parkland shooting, Valentine\u2019s Day, she said, she created a petition: a rough outline of what she wanted to see happen, which was for kids to pledge to walk out. \u201cIt kind of blew up overnight,\u201d she said. \n\n\n\nToday\u2019s energy has been incredible, and we\u2019ve shown the world that we\u2019re serious.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the end.\n\nWe have to keep the momentum going with the April 20th #NationalSchoolWalkout. \n\nNext month, even more people will stand up to demand change.\n\nWe will not give up.\n\u2014 National School Walkout (@schoolwalkoutUS) March 14, 2018\n\n\n\n\nIndivisible, the progressive organizing group founded after the 2016 election, is backing the April 20 walkout, and helping Murdock and some of her fellow students organize. \n\nSome students who participated in the March 14 walkout told Vox they would also demonstrate on April 20, though not all had events planned. Students at more than 1,500 schools have signed up so far to participate, though that number will probably balloon as the date gets closer.\n\n\u201cApril 20 isn\u2019t the end of this,\u201d Murdock said. \u201cApril 20 is the launch. We want to make sure we take all this momentum, power, and interest and turn it into concrete, actual change.\u201d \n\nTeen activism is driving a new push for gun control \nThe Parkland survivors ignited a new gun control movement by finding a platform in their tragedy. David Hogg rode his bike to school after the shooting to film as a journalist and then found himself on Fox News, where he said there couldn\u2019t be another mass shooting. Emma Gonzalez\u2019s speech led to a chant: \u201cWe call BS.\u201d Cameron Kasky challenged Florida Sen. Marco Rubio on accepting donations from the National Rifle Association during a CNN town hall. \n\nStudent activists are tired of being numb to school shootings, of simply moving on, of referring to \u201canother\u201d school shooting. Some have watched guns steal away family, friends, and classmates.\n\nKari Gottfried, a junior at Corvallis High School in Oregon, is 17; she wasn\u2019t even born when the shooting at Columbine High School happened. \u201cI\u2019ve never known a world where there aren\u2019t mass shootings,\u201d she said. \n\nGottfried and her fellow student activists feel this issue personally. They were in middle school when the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting happened \u2014 old enough to understand the savagery, young enough to remember their own elementary school classrooms. They\u2019ve grown up with active shooter drills, watched protocol morph in response to the latest tragedy. Gottfried said that now if the fire alarm goes off, students are told to go into lockdown mode. \u201cIt\u2019s more likely there would be a shooter than a fire in Corvallis,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re no strangers to gun violence,\u201d Fiorina Talaba, an 18-year-old senior from Carson High in California, said of herself and her fellow students. \u201cWhen we heard about the shooting in Florida, it really spoke to us, and we wanted to have some type of change.\u201d \n\nThe teenage activists have another thing in common: social media.

Freeman High School in Richmond, Virginia, made the case that those who demeaned his generation for being obsessed with their phones are in for their own awakening. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting for this issue, were making our voices these tools,\u201d he said.\n\nArielle Geismar, a 16-year-old junior at the Beacon School in Manhattan, is organizing a bus down to DC for the March for Our Lives. She said she felt an \u201curgency of collaboration.\u201d \n\n\u201cOur generation is so easily discredited as the social media generation, always on our phones,\u201d she said. \u201cBut look what social media has done for this movement. It turned into this national thing.\u201d \n\nThe public pressure has pushed lawmakers to act\nStudents are also pushing for gun law reform with the National School Walkout. They\u2019re focusing on small actions \u2014 what teenagers can do to get more involved, including registering to vote and writing to lawmakers.\n\nBut they can already claim some victories. The big one: refusing to let the country move on and forget.\n\nThat has put pressure on lawmakers to act. Staunchly pro-gun Florida bucked the NRA to pass the first gun restrictions in the state in more than 20 years, in consultation with the families of Parkland victims. The law increased the age to purchase a firearm to 21, instituted a three-day waiting period, and created a system for police to petition to remove guns from someone deemed a threat. It put millions of dollars toward school safety and mental health initiatives, though it included a controversial, voluntary program to arm some school employees.\n\nDozens of other states passed new gun safety measured in the aftermath of Parkland or are mulling new restrictions. Kansas, New York, and some other states are considering legislation similar to Florida\u2019s that would allow for judges to temporarily remove guns if people are deemed a threat. These \u201cred flag laws\u201d existed in five states before the Parkland shooting. Rhode Island\u2019s governor signed an executive order to institute such a policy after Parkland. \n\nWashington state banned bump stocks, devices that effectively let semiautomatic weapons function like fully automatic ones. Cincinnati, Ohio, wants to do the same. Illinois is trying to pass a measure that would require criminal background checks for all gun shop employees; the Parkland shooting has reanimated debate over the legislation.\n\nAnd some states have backed away from loosening gun control laws. Iowa is letting a bill die that would have removed the permit requirement to carry weapons.\n\nThe Trump administration took steps to ban bump stocks in the wake of Parkland and just released a school safety plan. It calls for \u201crisk protection orders\u201d to confiscate weapons from those deemed a threat and has a proposal to arm teachers. \n\nIt also calls on Congress to pass the Fix NICS Act, a bipartisan bill introduced after the Sutherland Springs, Texas, shooting to strengthen the background check system. The White House\u2019s plan is largely NRA-friendly \u2014 but the White House did not take similar action in the wake of massacres in Las Vegas or Sutherland Springs. \n\nStudents activists said they\u2019re open to different ideas and debates about the Second Amendment. Geismar said she and her fellow activists are just looking for middle ground. \u201cIt\u2019s not Republican or Democrat; it\u2019s about keeping people safe,\u201d she said. \n\nTalaba said she and her fellow students were focused particularly on mental health. She believes tighter background checks will help. But she also sees that as a first incremental, achievable step.  \n\nThe walkout is a chance to stake out their role in this debate. \u201cI just don\u2019t like how congressmen, or these older people, just don\u2019t see that even us kids, we can have these very serious conversations,\u201d Talaba said. \u201cWe know what we want from our society: to have less guns and, at some point, no guns at all.\u201d\n\nIt is also a reminder for lawmakers to listen and take these student activists seriously. All they can do now is lobby for change. But soon they\u2019ll be the ones with the power to decide politicians\u2019 fates \u2014 if not in 2018, then in 2020. \n\nBut it\u2019s bigger than elections, and uncomfortable conversations. As Nardi, the senior from Richmond said, \u201cThis is literally matter of life and death.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Matthew Yglesias", "body": "What\u2019s truly astounding about Conor Lamb\u2019s performance Tuesday night in a district Trump won by 20 points is that it isn\u2019t novel at all. \n\nLamb did 20 points better in PA-18 than Clinton did in 2016 and 17 points better than Obama did there back in 2012. That\u2019s impressive. What\u2019s even more impressive is if you look across 20 special elections held so far in 2018, mostly for state legislative seats, and discover that Democrats have done on average 24 points better than Clinton and 12 points better than Obama. \n\nToday the political class has started an autopsy of the Pennsylvania race \u2014 assessing Lamb\u2019s strength as a candidate and his opponent, Rick Saccone\u2019s, relative weaknesses. This same cycle has played out before this year: The morning after a race we pick it apart to see what happened. It\u2019s an understandable urge.\n\nBut these races aren\u2019t happening in isolation. The same dynamics are playing out over and over. And Republicans, especially, are desperately trying to interpret events as isolated campaigns gone awry. Instead of being terrified for scandal-free GOP incumbents holding down seats that Trump won by mere single-digits, they\u2019re staying the course. It\u2019s one of the signature aspects of the Republican Party in recent years \u2014 they resolutely refuse to act like they\u2019re afraid of anything. \n\nThis all might be good news for Democrats and professional pros, but it\u2019s a terrible sign for America.\n\nThe Trump-era GOP\u2019s bizarre synthesis\nRight up until Election Day 2016, Trump and congressional Republicans had a deeply uneasy relationship. \n\nOn the one hand, Trump viewed the overarching political philosophy of the GOP with barely concealed disdain and mused aloud as a candidate about the merits of universal health care and taxing the rich while promising to preserve Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid from cuts. \n\nHe suggested he\u2019d be tougher on the banks than Hillary Clinton and vowed to preserve basic clean air and clean water protections even while rolling back Obama\u2019s actions on climate change. Paired with an amped-up and heavily racialized version of cultural conservatism, this apparent ideological heterodoxy helped Trump score unprecedented success with working-class white voters.  \n\nAnd make no mistake \u2014 Trump was seen by the voters as the most moderate GOP nominee since Gerald Ford, positioned as slightly closer to the center than Bill Clinton in 1992.\n\nAt the same time, congressional Republicans viewed Trump as a dangerous figure with nearly one-third of the Senate GOP caucus refusing to commit to voting for him and House Speaker Paul Ryan famously proclaiming in October 2016 that he would no longer defend or campaign with Trump. \n\nDespite the internal tension and the 2-point popular vote loss, Trump emerged victorious in 2016; the way was clear for a potential juggernaut moving forward. If the GOP could adopt Trump\u2019s ideological synthesis while backing away from Trump\u2019s most disreputable personal qualities they\u2019d be positioned to do extremely well. \n\nBut instead they\u2019ve done the opposite. Trump behaves as flagrantly inappropriately as ever but now the entire party is complicit in it. In exchange, they\u2019ve gotten Trump to largely drop his eclectic policy approach in favor of a less-popular hard-right agenda. And now they\u2019re prepared to lose everywhere. \n\nAmerica needs the GOP to pull out of the tailspin\nThat Republicans manage to be doing so poorly with the economy humming along nicely is a godsend to Democratic Party operatives and political pros. But the foundation of that political success is a substantive disaster for the country. \n\nOn a policy level, the Trump-era GOP is pushing unpopular policies on all fronts, from the looming deportation of DREAMers to health care executive actions that are driving up premiums to rolling back net neutrality to dismantling consumer financial protection rules. These are enormously harmful to the short-term interests of millions of people and to the long-term interests of nearly the entire country. \n\nAt the same time, Trump continues to act like a maniac \u2014 just this week he fired the secretary of state over Twitter, deployed inappropriate political rhetoric at an official speech to active-duty Marines, and denied Russian culpability for assassinations carried out on British soil \u2014 and it\u2019s only Wednesday. \n\nAt the same time, he\u2019s enmeshed in an unprecedented level of personal corruption; his business enterprises are set up as perfect vehicles for interest groups seeking favors from the government to line his pockets with cash. And the growing Stormy Daniels scandal suggests a whole new dimension of possible corruption and lawbreaking over and above the basic financial conflicts of interest and the shenanigans with the Russians. \n\nThe American system, fundamentally, is meant to run more on prudence and separation of powers than on relentless partisan warfare. Congressional Republicans are supposed to see that Trump\u2019s corruption and aberrant behavior are unpopular and do what they can to check him, while Trump is supposed to see that the GOP policy agenda is extreme and unpopular and do what he can to trim its sails. If they did that, the fundamentally benign economic and international climate might assert itself and they\u2019d win the midterms. \n\nInstead, Trump and congressional Republicans are acting like Thelma and Louise holding hands as they drive the car off the cliff. \n\nThe special election results out of Pennsylvania and elsewhere are a welcome reminder that there really are consequences for political malpractice. But the worry has to be that the longer we stay on this path, the higher the chances are that we\u2019ll all end up paying the price.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Zack Beauchamp", "body": "Sunday\u2019s election in Russia, a rigged affair that Vladimir Putin won handily, seems on its face a testament to the strength of his regime. Putin staged a simulacrum of democracy, handed himself another term in office, and faced little in the way of opposition throughout the whole process.\n\nBut this interpretation papers over a deeper and more fundamental flaw in Putin\u2019s government. While Putin himself has a secure hold on power for the foreseeable future, he will eventually grow old and die. And the government he has created is so dependent on him that no one knows who \u2014 or what \u2014 will take over when he\u2019s gone.\n\nThis is not merely a problem for Putin (age 65) and Russia. Strongmen in other major countries, like Egypt\u2019s Abdel Fattah el-Sisi (63) and China\u2019s Xi Jinping (64), aren\u2019t young men. All of these leaders have created political systems that revolve around their own personal influence and support networks. But the problem with strongman rule is that the strongmen are not immortal, and once they fall ill or die, it\u2019s not obvious who will replace them.\n\nIronically, the very means they have used to secure power for themselves in the short run have created a fundamental threat to their regimes in the long run.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that the governments of Russia, China, or Egypt will necessarily collapse.  Plenty of political systems led by strongmen who died in office, like Hafez al-Assad in Syria and Turkmenistan\u2019s Saparmurat Niyazov, have successfully managed to hand over power to a chosen successor after their deaths.\n\nBut the best political science research we have suggests that transition in systems like this is always much less secure, and more likely to produce political instability or even violence, than democratic elections \u2014 or even other kinds of authoritarian systems, like hereditary monarchies.\n\nIf you look at the geopolitical events of the past several years, it\u2019s easy to think that authoritarianism is ascendant. Domestic problems in leading democracies like the United States and the United Kingdom, the slide toward strongman rule in places like Turkey and Hungary, and the rising global assertiveness of Russia and China all suggest to some that the future may belong to authoritarians. \n\nBut that analysis assumes these authoritarian governments are actually as stable as they seem. And that\u2019s not true. \n\nThe world\u2019s strongmen may reign for years, perhaps decades \u2014 but their inevitable deaths will expose political systems built on rickety foundations. Sometime in the not-so-distant future, the cracks will start to show. And when they do, the world will begin to see why rule-by-strongman is not, in the long run, an attractive model for running a country.\n\nThe potentially fatal flaw in the Putin regime\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Vladimir Putin and Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev (R) at the 2014 Olympics.\n      \n      \n        Photo by David Goldman-Pool/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nIn March 2017, a scholar named Fiona Hill published a paper on \u201cthe question of succession\u201d in modern Russia. At the time, Hill was working at the Brookings Institution, a centrist Washington think tank; today she is in the White House, serving as the National Security Council\u2019s senior director for Russia.\n\nHill\u2019s paper begins with a stark warning: Putin\u2019s push to centralize power has made the Russian political system remarkably vulnerable if he\u2019s forced out of power or dies in office.\n\n\u201cThe increased preponderance of power in the Kremlin has created greater risk for the Russian political system now than at any other juncture in recent history,\u201d Hill writes. \u201cPutin has the capacity to designate a successor ... but even this could prove a heavy lift for the system.\u201d\n\nHill points to several features of the Russian political system that would make it tough for \u201cthe next Mr. Putin,\u201d as she puts it, to emerge. The first is that Putin\u2019s government depends heavily on personal loyalty. \u201cThe elites who have clout,\u201d she writes, \u201chave been recruited from a network of personal relationships spanning Putin\u2019s youth in Soviet Leningrad and his entire career.\u201d \n\nThere is no guarantee that those people could be counted on to remain loyal to any one successor rather than devolving into infighting over who gets to control what after Putin\u2019s death. Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin\u2019s death in 1924, to take one historical example, triggered a violent factional dispute in the Soviet Communist Party \u2014 one that ended only when a particularly ruthless Soviet official named Josef Stalin managed to consolidate power. \n\nA second flaw in Putin\u2019s system, Hill suggests, is the way it celebrates the personal qualities of the man himself. Official Russian propaganda emphasizes his strength and manliness \u2014 see all of those famous shirtless photo ops \u2014 depicting him as a kind of father figure for the Russian state. \n\nPutin has played up this cult of personality, doing things like taking phone calls from random Russian citizens on television to emphasize his personal role in solving people\u2019s problems. If Putin is \u201cincapacitated in some way,\u201d Hill warns, \u201cthis changes the system\u2019s operating context.\u201d\n\nA third issue \u2014 and perhaps the most fundamental \u2014 is that Putin hasn\u2019t built up a strong political party to solidify his regime. United Russia, the leading Putin-aligned faction in Russia\u2019s legislature, doesn\u2019t have much in the way of actual governing responsibilities; it mostly rubber-stamps Putin\u2019s decisions. \n\nReal political parties, like the Communist Party in the Soviet Union, can handpick successors and help facilitate a smooth transfer of power. Without a strong party, Putin\u2019s eventual death or retirement is significantly more likely to kick off factional infighting between Putin\u2019s cronies and unrest among the greater Russian public.\n\n\u201cMost observers have no idea how [his] succession is going to play out. I don\u2019t think Putin himself even knows what he\u2019s going to do,\u201d Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a Russia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told me.\n\nThere are ways to stave off this problem \u2014 and Putin shows no signs of ill health, which means he should have quite a few years left to work on this problem. But the issues that complicate his succession aren\u2019t small things. They are fundamental problems that stem from the nature of the government he\u2019s built. \n\nIn order to fix things, Putin would need to undo the very factors that make his government durable in the short term: his installation of loyal cronies throughout the government, his development of a cult of personality in the Russian press, and his decision to keep political parties weak to forestall challengers. Trying to cement his legacy would, somewhat ironically, jeopardize his own power. \n\nIt\u2019s possible that Russia muddles through this, and that Putin\u2019s allies settle on a consensus successor choice who can carry on the predecessor\u2019s policies. But that\u2019s not a guarantee, and there could be lots of instability on the way. It may take years, or even decades, but it could be very bloody once it comes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a question I like to ask Russia specialists: \u2018If Putin has a heart attack tomorrow, what happens?\u2019 Nobody knows,\u201d Milan Svolik, a Yale University expert on authoritarianism, told the New York Times. \n\nIt\u2019s not just Russia: other large authoritarian countries have similar problems\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n      \n      \n        (Lintao Zhang/Pool/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nRussia is not the only country with a political system like this. It actually fits a familiar archetype among political scientists called, somewhat clunkily, \u201cpersonalist authoritarianism.\u201d\n\nIn personalist systems, all power flows from the figure at the top. Leaders systematically weaken any other potential source of political power, maintaining their influence through repression and the dispensation of favors to a favored elite. The official state ideology tends to emphasize the personal strength and qualities of the autocrat, as opposed to some kind of broader ideological foundation. Everything centers on one man (and yes, historically, it\u2019s almost always a man).\n\nNot all authoritarian countries are personalist. Saudi Arabia, for example, is a hereditary monarchy; power is vested in the royal family as a unit rather than the king alone. And the Soviet Union was a one-party state, where the Communist Party \u2014 not a single person \u2014 shaped the system. \n\nThese types of regimes have fewer issues with succession than personalist ones. Kings have crown princes to take over when they die, and party leaders can vote on the next premier. But in a personalist regime, all power and legitimacy rests in the Big Man. Without him, it\u2019s not obvious who gets to take over next, which means that the leader\u2019s death is more likely to create a crisis.\n\nStatistical research by Kendall-Taylor and Michigan State\u2019s Erica Frantz shows that monarchies and one-party dictatorships tend to hold together even after an individual king or strongman dies. That\u2019s not true for regimes like what Putin has created in Russia or what Xi is creating in China and Sisi is building in Egypt, which are far more brittle \u2014 and far likelier to collapse when the individual leader dies or is pushed out of power.\n\n\u201cThe more concentrated that power is in the regime, the more likely that you\u2019re going to see change in the wake of a leader\u2019s death,\u201d as Frantz put it to me in an interview.\n\nThis should raise alarm bells about the future stability of both Egypt and, more surprisingly, China.\n\nEgypt is a kind of twist on the Russian system. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, like Putin, has turned himself into a kind of Big Man who rules based on dispensing favors to build loyalty and a sense that he, personally, is the nation\u2019s savior. \n\nUnlike Putin, he came from a military background and rose to power in a 2013 coup (which had significant public backing). This means that current and former military officers make up the hardest core of Sisi\u2019s support inside the Egyptian government; his regime looks more like a military junta than Putin\u2019s.\n\nBut the Egyptian military, as far as anyone can tell, does not have a plan for what happens when Sisi goes. He has managed to centralize so much power in his own person that no one seems like a possible replacement. The result is that his departure, through either death or incapacitating illness, could kick off an intra-military power struggle or even another popular uprising.\n\n\u201cThe only thing anyone can say with some degree of certainty ... is that the next president will come from the military. The question is how that will happen,\u201d Sahar Aziz, an Egypt expert at Rutgers University, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen through an election,\u201d she added.\n\nChina would seem to be relatively immune from a succession crisis. Like the Soviet Union, China has a strong political party that\u2019s ostensibly tasked with picking the country\u2019s next leader. It has done so successfully three times in the past 30 years, handing power from Deng Xiaoping to Jiang Zemin to Hu Jintao to Xi Jinping.\n\nBut Xi has decided to break the mold, working to marginalize his opponents inside the Communist Party and centralize power in his own figure. Chinese state propaganda has started celebrating Xi in a manner similar to the way Russian media celebrates Putin; \u201cXi Jinping Thought,\u201d the leader\u2019s personal ideology, was recently officially added to the Chinese constitution.\n\nMost tellingly, Xi recently abolished term limits for the presidency, which most China watchers took as a sign that he is attempting to stay in power for life. This is a massive break with the past: The term limits were set up by Deng Xiaoping to ensure a regular and party-determined handover of power, giving institutions power over any one leader. Abolishing them is the biggest step yet toward a kind of Putinism with Chinese characteristics.\n\nChina is essentially a hybrid between a one-party state and a personalist regime \u2014 and strongly trending in the latter direction. The more Xi marginalizes the party and concentrates power in his own hands, the less stable the Chinese system will be when he leaves office. \n\n\u201cXi\u2019s moves surely extend his time in office, but they are likely to make that regime more fragile among his departure,\u201d said Frantz. \u201cAs power becomes more concentrated in places that historically have strong parties ... the regime lasts less time than it would have otherwise.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line is that the problem of succession is not just one for Vladimir Putin\u2019s government. It\u2019s one that afflicts the many personalist autocracies around the world, including powerful countries like Egypt and (increasingly) China.\n\nAnd what makes the Russia-Egypt-China triumvirate so interesting is that their leaders are all around the same age. That means it\u2019s at least theoretically possible that three large and extremely important countries will face major succession crises \u2014 conflict between regime elites or popular uprisings \u2014 around the same time.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate the significance such events could have for world politics. Yet that\u2019s the reality we may see in the not-distant future. And it\u2019s one that bears serious thought as we discuss another global political crisis \u2014 the alleged crisis of Western democracy.\n\nWhy the succession problem is good news for democracy\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        A pro-democracy protest in Turkey.\n      \n      \n        (Chris McGrath/Getty Images)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThere\u2019s been a series of examples in the past two decades or so of democracies sliding toward personalist autocracies.\n\nIn Venezuela, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, a democratically elected president, packed the country\u2019s Supreme Court with his allies and locked up human rights activists; his successor, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has ruled as a flat-out autocrat. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has amended the country\u2019s constitution to grant himself sweeping powers and forcibly seized control of Zaman, a major newspaper that had been critical of his rule. And there are signs of this creeping authoritarianism in European countries like Hungary and Poland.\n\nThere is even a sense among major Western countries, in the wake of Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, that democracy is becoming less attractive as a political model. A recent report from the National Endowment for Democracy, a US government institution, argues that Russia and China have attempted to weaken faith in democracy. In different and uncoordinated ways, the two countries are working to prop up their kind of authoritarian systems as more attractive alternatives. \n\n\u201cThe decision makers in Beijing and Moscow clearly have the political will and the resources to build up and implement their influence efforts. By comparison, the United States and other leading democracies seem to have withdrawn from competition in the ideas sphere,\u201d the report\u2019s authors conclude. \u201cThe authoritarian initiatives themselves are truly global in scope, turning up in democratic countries on every continent.\u201d\n\nThe general zeitgeist is one of a decadent democratic West and ascendant authoritarian East. But we risk assuming that things will remain this way at our peril.\n\nIf expert assessments and political science research on personalism tell us anything, it\u2019s that the kind of authoritarian governments that seem on the rise now are brittle. They depend heavily on the whims and efficacy of one man, a man who \u2014 like all other men \u2014 will get sick and die. \n\nEven short of that, these leaders have to play a delicate balancing act with their elites, courting allies who can prop them up without allowing for the emergence of a viable challenger. And they need to keep their populations at least complacent about authoritarian rule.\n\nDemocracy, by contrast, is built to survive more than one leader. The entire point of the system is to ensure changeover, to give the people a reason to believe in their governments and support them regardless of who is in power. In the long run, democracies are less prone to crisis and collapse than their authoritarian competitors \u2014 and that could end up making democracy the clearly more attractive model internationally once again.\n\nThe point, then, is that the sense of democratic crisis that permeates today\u2019s politics may eventually prove ephemeral. It could be that we\u2019re merely at an ebb in the democratic tide; that what\u2019s coming in the next 20 years isn\u2019t a further decline in democracy but a new crisis of authoritarianism.\n\nSo the next time you read something about Putin\u2019s strength and ambitions, remember one vital fact: His days are numbered.

Michael Horowitz, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, responded by saying he had revised his estimation upwards by a factor of five.\n\nNor is Bolton alone in his hawkishness. Trump\u2019s pick for his new secretary of state, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, is a vocal opponent of the nuclear deal with Iran who has called for strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. More recently, he\u2019s mused about regime change in North Korea.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful we will find a way to separate that regime from this system,\u201d Pompeo said in a 2017 interview. \u201cThe North Korean people, I\u2019m sure are lovely people and would love to see him [Kim Jong Un] go.\u201d\n\nEqually important are the people Bolton and Pompeo are replacing. Outgoing National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster was relatively hawkish on Korea, but was a staunch voice for preserving the Iran Deal. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is a relative dove on both issues; he also believed in keeping the Iran deal in place, and has repeatedly and publicly reached out to North Korea to try to come to a diplomatic solution to the nuclear crisis.\n\nThe current cabinet shakeup reflects Trump\u2019s desires to eliminate the people who saw their jobs as restraining him, and replacing them with people who are more likely to enable him\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether or not Trump wants war with North Korea or Iran. But he appears to be systematically replacing the top advisers who have put the breaks on his more hawkish impulses \u2014 the so-called \u201cadults in the room\u201d \u2014 and replacing them with people who are likely to push for military solutions. Jeremy Bash, a former chief of staff at the both the CIA and the Defense Department, said on MSNBC Friday morning that Trump is \u201cassembling a war cabinet\u201d \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to argue with him.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018axis of adults\u2019 era is officially over,\u201d says Derek Chollet, senior advisor for security and defense policy at The German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s possible we\u2019re entering the era of Trump unbound \u2014 with all of the instability that entails.\n\nWhy Trump\u2019s hawkish team is so dangerous\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Mike Pompeo.\n      \n      \n        (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThe early theory of the Trump administration was that the \u201caxis of adults,\u201d as Chollet puts it, could keep Trump from launching a war, tearing up US alliances, or any other rash and dangerous decision. Officials like McMaster, Tillerson, and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, the thinking went, would corral the inexperienced and inattentive president and essentially ensure that traditional American foreign policy remained in place.\n\nThis theory didn\u2019t work out very well in practice.  Examples include Trump deciding to move the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem \u2014 which experts say as already made it harder for the US to broker an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal,  the withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, decertifying Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal, and imposing dangerous tariffs on steel and aluminum imports because he was angry about bad press coverage.\n\nThe issue, accounts from inside the White House suggest, is that Trump despised the notion that he needed to be managed by \u201cadults,\u201d and told to ignore his own feelings in favor of what his advisors told him. Trump always hated the Iran deal, the Paris agreement, and all the rest \u2014 and deeply resented being told to ignore them. \u201cAides say the quickest way to get Trump to do something is to tell him he can\u2019t,\u201d as Axios\u2019s Mike Allen puts it.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the so-called adults were entirely ineffectual. They reportedly played a role in convincing Trump to stay in the Iran deal, rather than tearing it up entirely \u2014 which he seems to want to do. They prevented him from fatally undermining NATO and managed to quietly take some steps, like sending US troops to Poland, to challenge Russia. Rather, it\u2019s that the adults were merely a haphazard and ineffectual barrier against Trump\u2019s instincts \u2014 which, contrary to some popular myths, have always been quite hawkish.\n\nAnd that, in many ways, is the critical point here. After a little over a year, Trump is now more confident in his own judgments and political impulses. The current cabinet shakeup reflects Trump\u2019s desires to eliminate the people who saw their jobs as restraining him, and replacing them with people who are more likely to enable him.\n\n\u201cA dozen people close to Mr. Trump or the White House, including current and former aides and longtime friends, described him as newly emboldened to say what he really feels and to ignore the cautions of those around him,\u201d the New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman reports. \u201cThat self-confidence has led to a series of surprising comments and actions that have pushed the Trump presidency in an ever more tumultuous direction.\u201d\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that Trump is intentionally laying the groundwork for two new wars. Trump\u2019s feelings on war with North Korea and Iran are, like on so many issues, extremely hard to pin down. He\u2019s threatened to hit North Korea with \u201cfire and fury like the world has ever seen,\u201d but also accepted an offer to meet with Kim Jong Un face-to-face. He wants to tear up the Iran deal, but has proposed an unspecified \u201cbetter deal\u201d \u2014 not war \u2014 as the alternative.\n\nRather, it\u2019s that the kind of people who Trump feels more comfortable with \u2014 the ones who he feels reflect his instincts and approach to the job most closely \u2014 are people on the extremely hawkish far-right. And the more power these people have, meaning direct access to the president and control over the national security bureaucracy, the more likely they are to be able to push their ideas.\n\nWith Trump, a lot of things hinge on turning his vague feelings \u2014 North Korea can\u2019t be allowed to threaten the United States, the Iran deal is a disaster \u2014 into concrete and actionable policies. Officials who Trump thinks speak for him are more likely to convince that their policy ideas represent an authentic articulation of the president\u2019s vision.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Bolton and Pompeo are savvy bureaucratic operators. There were similarly radical figures in the early Trump administration, like former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and senior strategist Steve Bannon. But the two men were relatively unskilled at bureaucratic infighting. Take the executive order banning citizens of several Muslim countries from entering the US: Bannon\u2019s failure to understand law and the bureaucracy turned the rollout of this Muslim ban into a catastrophe that\u2019s still tied up in court.  They were no match for people like Mattis, who has somehow managed to exercise a restraining influence on the president and remain in his good graces. \n\nMatthew Waxman, a former Bush administration official who worked with Bolton during his several year-long tenure at the State Department, experienced this firsthand.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a masterful bureaucratic tactician,\u201d Waxman wrote in a Friday piece for Lawfare. \u201cRather than just adding a Fox-newsy ideologue who shifts the balance of the administration team\u2019s view further toward the president\u2019s most hawkish outlook, Trump has added someone who can actually help him make that outlook into reality.\u201d\n\nBolton and Pompeo, unlike Flynn and Bannon, are demonstrably good at this game \u2014 and Bolton, at least, is more hawkish than his predecessors. Mattis is running low on allies, with Tillerson and National Economic Council chair Gary Cohn out. And Trump himself seems to feel emboldened to do...well, whatever it is that he wants to do.\n\nBolton will take office soon. Pompeo will as well, if he makes it through his Senate confirmation process, which seems likely. Trump has reshuffled his cabinet before, and will probably do so again. But pay close attention to what these two men do in their new jobs. Every day those two are in their jobs, the risk of a major war will remain far above what we\u2019re used to \u2014 and, frankly, what we should be comfortable with.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Alex Ward", "body": "President Donald Trump\u2019s unprecedented attacks on federal law enforcement turned even more vindictive over a series of jarring events last weekend.\n\nThe drama began with the late Friday night firing of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe just 26 hours before he would have qualified for a full federal pension. It ended Sunday with a string of presidential tweets attacking McCabe, former FBI Director James Comey, and special counsel Robert Mueller. Trump had never before attacked Mueller by name in a tweet. \n\nTaken together, the weekend\u2019s developments show that Trump\u2019s war with US law enforcement has entered a new phase and that the president and his loyalists feel more emboldened to attack Mueller and others working on the Trump-Russia probe directly. It also raised new fears that Trump would take the extreme step of actually firing Mueller himself \u2014 a move that both Democrats and Republicans say would spark a constitutional crisis. \n\n\u201cThis is an escalation because it\u2019s open warfare against the special counsel by name, and it\u2019s capping off a 10-month effort to thwart the FBI and Mueller,\u201d Andy Wright, a professor at Savannah Law School, told Vox. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happens next because we\u2019re in uncharted territory.\u201d\n\nMcCabe\u2019s ouster late Friday night raised eyebrows throughout Washington because of its seeming spitefulness \u2014 the move could cost him his benefits \u2014 and because it came after Trump spent months publicly calling for his head. \n\nMcCabe, according to someone close to him, never spoke with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, FBI Director Christopher Wray, or Trump about his termination. Instead, he found out after someone close to him read Sessions\u2019s firing statement to him over the phone. The statement had already appeared on TV by that point; McCabe received an email about his ouster mere minutes before Sessions made the announcement but didn\u2019t see it in time.\n\nMcCabe\u2019s firing also set the stage for a dramatic escalation of Trump\u2019s standoff with Mueller. Early Saturday morning, Trump\u2019s lead personal lawyer John Dowd told reporters that Mueller\u2019s probe should end, pointing to McCabe\u2019s firing as a sign the whole investigation is tainted.  \n\nHours later on Saturday, reports surfaced that McCabe took notes of his interactions with Trump and gave them to Mueller. McCabe\u2019s onetime boss, Comey, also kept notes about his interactions with the president because he worried Trump would lie about them. \n\nIt\u2019s not clear if McCabe had similar concerns, but he might be able to corroborate Comey\u2019s claim that Trump pressured him to end the FBI\u2019s probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. If he does that, that makes Mueller\u2019s obstruction of justice case much stronger.\n\nAnd last but certainly not least, Trump spent his Sunday morning firing off tweets directed at McCabe, Comey, and Mueller. Trump accused Comey of lying under oath; questioned the existence and validity of McCabe\u2019s memos; and criticized Mueller by name for allegedly filling the ranks of his team of prosecutors and investigators with Democrats.\n\nMueller and Comey didn\u2019t comment, but McCabe issued a fiery statement on Friday arguing that he\u2019d been purposefully, and cruely, \u201csingled out\u201d by the president.\n\nIf you missed any of last weekend\u2019s events, don\u2019t worry. Here\u2019s a guide to one of the most dramatic \u2014 and potentially most legally and politically significant \u2014 weekends in months.\n\nSessions fired McCabe \u2014 and McCabe fired back at Trump\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.\n      \n      \n        Stephen Lam/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThe Trump administration argues that there were legitimate grounds for firing McCabe right before he\u2019d be eligible for his full pension. \n\nHere\u2019s why: Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz found that McCabe inappropriately allowed two top officials to speak to reporters in 2016 about his decision to open a case into the Clinton Foundation. This incident was under investigation as part of a broader look into how the FBI and Justice Department handled themselves during the most recent presidential election.\n\nAccording to reports about the watchdog\u2019s conclusion, which is still under wraps, McCabe apparently misled investigators during an interview with the inspector general, a charge McCabe denies. Still, that led to a recommendation that Sessions should fire McCabe \u2014 a recommendation Sessions acted on last Friday night.\n\n\u201cThe FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability. As the OPR proposal stated, \u2018all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand,\u2019\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement provided by the Justice Department. \n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Sessions had to recuse himself from the Mueller probe due to his interactions with Russians as a member of the Trump campaign, which calls into question his involvement in McCabe\u2019s ouster.\n\nLeading Democrats and Republicans criticized the timing of McCabe\u2019s firing, which seemed vindictive given how many of the benefits he earned over the course of a two-decade career are now at risk. \n\nBeyond the timing, though, many Democrats also warned that the move looked like political payback by a White House that has been attacking McCabe by name for months.\n\nTrump\u2019s anger toward McCabe goes back to a long-running controversy over his wife\u2019s alleged political ties to Hillary Clinton. In 2015, McCabe\u2019s wife ran for a state Senate seat in Virginia, backed in part with money provided by the state Democratic Party and Terry McAuliffe, a prominent Clinton ally. \n\nTrump and other Republicans have argued that those financial donations meant that McCabe was a partisan secretly harboring an anti-Trump agenda. Trump also made it personal: He once asked McCabe what it was like to have a \u201closer\u201d wife.\n\nTrump, who has tweeted about his anger over the McCabes for months, made reference to his long-standing ire again on Saturday.\n\n\n\nThe Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught, called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife\u2019s campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation? How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 17, 2018\n\n\n\n\nBeyond that, McCabe himself was ensnared in controversy over text messages that Peter Strzok, an FBI agent, sent to federal attorney Lisa Page. Strzok had mentioned someone named \u201cAndy\u201d in a text message to Page, suggesting there was a discussion about Trump \u2014 and not a positive one \u2014 in McCabe\u2019s office. Conservative media harped on this text, implying that McCabe was part of a grand anti-Trump conspiracy.\n\nOthers in the GOP came to McCabe\u2019s defense after the firing. \u201cHe should have been allowed to finish through the weekend,\u201d Republican Sen. Marco Rubio told Meet the Press on Sunday. \u201cIf that report would\u2019ve indicated wrongdoing or something that was actionable, there are things that could\u2019ve been done after the fact. But, you know, 48 hours to go before retirement, I would\u2019ve certainly done it differently given the fact there\u2019s still this report out there that hasn\u2019t come in.\u201d\n\nThe most impassioned defense came from McCabe himself. In a defiant statement about Sessions\u2019s decision, McCabe said he had been targeted by the president for political, and possibly illegal, reasons:\n\nHere is the reality: I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey. The release of this report was accelerated only after my testimony to the House Intelligence Committee revealed that I would corroborate former Director Comey\u2019s accounts of his discussions with the President. The OIG\u2019s focus on me and this report became a part of an unprecedented effort by the Administration, driven by the President himself, to remove me from my position, destroy my reputation, and possibly strip me of a pension that I worked 21 years to earn. The accelerated release of the report, and the punitive actions taken in response, make sense only when viewed through this lens.\n\nMcCabe might ultimately have the last word about his involvement in the Trump-Russia probe (more on that below). In the meantime, Trump\u2019s own legal team is already trying to use his firing to disrupt \u2014 and possibly terminate \u2014 the special counsel\u2019s work.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyer is pushing to end Mueller\u2019s investigation\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Preisdent Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer John Dowd.\n      \n      \n        Yana Paskova/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nWithin hours of McCabe\u2019s firing, Dowd, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, asked Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to kill the Justice Department\u2019s Russia probe. (Rosenstein has direct authority over the Mueller probe.) \n\nDowd, in an email to reporters, linked McCabe to the Russia investigation and blamed Comey for making up a case.\n\nI pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe\u2019s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt dossier.\n\nDowd had initially told the Daily Beast that he was speaking on behalf of Trump as his \u201ccounsel,\u201d only to backtrack after his statement was published and say he was actually speaking for himself. That matters because Trump has repeatedly denied that he\u2019s trying to get rid of Mueller, largely relying on Republican allies to make the case for him.\n\nDowd is a longtime Washington lawyer, having helped Senator John McCain confront the Keating Five banking scandal as far back as 1990. He joined Trump\u2019s team to combat the Mueller probe in June, taking the lead as Trump\u2019s chief outside lawyer (Trump is also represented by White House counsel Don McGahn and Ty Cobb, who handles the White House\u2019s response to Mueller\u2019s investigation).\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Dowd\u2019s comments about Mueller have sparked a political controversy . In December, Trump tweeted that he \u201chad to fire\u201d former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn because Flynn had lied to the FBI.\n\n\n\nI had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 2, 2017\n\n\n\n\nThe tweet created a headache for the White House because of the implied timing. Flynn left the White House on February 13, 2017. Trump then met with Comey the next day, and according to notes Comey took after the meeting, asked him to \u201clet Flynn go.\u201d\n\nThat would mean that Trump knew Flynn had committed a felony \u2014 lying to the FBI \u2014 when he asked Comey to drop the case, suggesting that the president tried to knowingly obstruct justice.\n\nDowd later told NBC News that he had dictated the tweet to Trump\u2019s social media director, Dan Scavino, and that Trump didn\u2019t know that Flynn had lied to federal agents.\n\nAnd Dowd also told Axios in December that Trump \u201ccannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer\u201d of the US, a claim that was heavily disputed by legal experts who spoke to Vox. Former FBI agent Asha Rangappa said that the president\u2019s position of power does not mean he can do anything he wants.\n\n\u201cThe president is not above the law, and can indeed be guilty of obstructing justice,\u201d Rangappa said.\n\nMcCabe recorded his interactions with Trump\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe\n      \n      \n        Pete Marovich/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nLordy, it looks like McCabe has memos.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, multiple news outlets reported that McCabe took notes about his interactions with Trump. We don\u2019t know what they contain. But there\u2019s at least one person who does: Mueller, because McCabe reportedly handed his notes over to the special counsel\u2019s team. Mueller\u2019s team has also reportedly interviewed McCabe and asked him questions about how Trump fired Comey.\n\nThat\u2019s potentially important because the memos can give Muller has even more insight into how Trump dealt with FBI leadership, and if at any point he attempted to end the probe. Recall that one of Comey\u2019s memos, which was initially reported by the New York Times in May 2017, said that the president encouraged Comey to drop the investigation into ousted Flynn. Comey also revealed that Trump requested a pledge a loyalty from Comey, which Comey refused to offer. \n\nMcCabe could corroborate Comey\u2019s claim that Trump tried to obstruct justice by verifying the contents of Comey\u2019s memo and recalling what Trump said to Comey. Apparently, McCabe\u2019s memos also contain information about his conversation with Comey. If McCabe tells Mueller all of this, the special counsel might have an even stronger case if he decides to take the historic step of trying to indict a sitting president.\n\nTrump, for his part, doesn\u2019t believe there are memos at all. He mentioned as much during a furious tweetstorm on Sunday, which brings us to...\n\nTrump tweets his rage\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        President Donald Trump.\n      \n      \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nOn Sunday, Washington woke to a Trump tweetstorm in which the president reiterated his claim that the Mueller investigation was a \u201cWITCH HUNT\u201d and defended the McCabe firing.\n\n\n\nThe Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s tweets included a slew of previously debunked allegations and misleading claims. \n\nTrump\u2019s tweet referenced the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court \u2014 which reviews requests from the FBI to spy on Americans when there\u2019s evidence that they might be working with a foreign government \u2014 that approved surveilling former Trump campaign aide Carter Page in October 2016. The FBI used information from a highly controversial dossier, written by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele, alleging Page met with Russian officials and that the Kremlin has compromising information on the president.\n\nRepublicans claim that the FBI didn\u2019t tell the FISA judge enough about the information, and that it was the main reason they got the warrant, while Democrats say that the FBI acted properly. They pointed to a series of meetings  between Page and a Russian intelligence operative in 2013 as one of many reasons beyond the Steele dossier that Page was of interest to investigators.  \n\nThe warrant request itself is classified, and hasn\u2019t been made public.\n\nTrump also continued to insist that there was \u201cno collusion and there was no crime\u201d associated with his campaign.\n\nWhen House Republicans closed their Russia probe on Monday they said that they had found no proof of collusion, although the Senate and Mueller team are still investigating.\n\nThere have been crimes though.\n\nFour people tied to the Trump campaign have pleaded guilty to crimes as part of the Mueller probe, while Trump\u2019s former campaign chair Paul Manafort has been indicted.\n\nThree of the four have admitted to lying to investigators. The fourth, Manafort\u2019s former right-hand man Rick Gates, also plead guilty to \u201cconspiracy against the United States.\u201d\n\nNew York Times reporter Maggie Haberman wrote that Trump\u2019s team had recently received questions from Mueller for a potential interview with Trump, which may have set the president off.\n\nTrump also used twitter to push a running argument among conservatives that Mueller\u2019s probe is biased because some of the lawyers on his team are supposedly Democrats.\n\n\n\nWhy does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThe emphasis on the political leanings of the investigators is not new. As Vox reported in December:\n\nThe attacks began over the summer when reports showed that some of Mueller\u2019s top prosecutors previously donated to Democrats. For example: James Quarles, a top lawyer on Mueller\u2019s team with experience in the Watergate case, donated thousands of dollars to the Michael Dukakis, Al Gore, John Kerry, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton campaigns. Critics said such donations meant that Quarles \u2014 and by extension the Mueller probe itself \u2014 couldn\u2019t objectively carry out the investigation.\n\nWhile Trump and other Republicans have been complaining about the political interests of Mueller\u2019s team, it\u2019s actually against the law to consider political affiliations when making decisions about who to hire, according to the FBI.\n\n\u201cFederal law and Department policy prohibit the use of political or ideological affiliations to assess applicants,\u201d an FBI report on politicization at the agency released in 2008 found. PolitiFact did its own analysis of campaign contributions by the Mueller team, and while donations skewed heavily towards democrats \u2014 $62,043 in total \u2014 Republicans did receive $2,750 from team members.\n\nThe weekend was profoundly unsettling, as Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein has argued \u201cMcCabe\u2019s firing shows how Trump has corroded the operations of the American government.\u201d It may get even worse in the coming days, especially if the president is winding up to try to remove Mueller.\n\nWright, the current law professor and former White House lawyer, told Vox he\u2019s worried about what\u2019s yet to come for one startling reason: \u201cThe president of the United States is unhinged.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Rachel Wolfe", "body": "President Trump ignoring an explicit warning from advisers on a tricky foreign policy topic is nothing new \u2014 but on Tuesday, Trump took it to a new level in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. \n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Trump either didn\u2019t read or chose to ignore a section in his briefing materials that said, bluntly, \u201cDO NOT CONGRATULATE\u201d Putin on his election victory \u2014 and went ahead and did it immediately anyway:\n\nIt was not clear whether Trump read the notes, administration officials said. Trump, who initiated the call, opened it with the congratulations for Putin, one person familiar with the conversation said.\n\nTrump defended his actions Wednesday afternoon in a tweet that lambasted the \u201cFake News Media\u201d and concluded that \u201cgetting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.\u201d  \n\n\n\nI called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.......\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 21, 2018\n\n\n\n\nWhy Trump\u2019s advisers didn\u2019t want him to congratulate Putin\nWhile it\u2019s fairly routine for world leaders to congratulate one another on electoral victories, the news media is right to point out that the Russian election wasn\u2019t exactly a shining example of democracy. Putin\u2019s most prominent opponent wasn\u2019t on the ballot, and the Associated Press reported on voting irregularities. \n\nAs Trump pointed out in his tweet, President Obama also congratulated Putin when he ran in a similarly unfair election in 2012, to a chorus of criticism from Republicans. Still, given that Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia has been a source of skepticism throughout his tenure as president \u2014 and considering the ongoing investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia \u2014 the phone call is another reminder of the president\u2019s friendly attitude toward Putin. \n\nTrump later described the conversation \u2014 which spanned topics including arms control and security in North Korea and Syria, but not the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy and his daughter in Great Britain \u2014 as a \u201cvery good call,\u201d according to the Post\u2019s Carol D. Leonnig, David Nakamura, and Josh Dawsey.\n\nBeyond Trump\u2019s remarks to Putin, the Washington Post report shows leaks are still coming from the White House \u2014 in this case, a close adviser went behind the president\u2019s back to talk to the press hours after he hung up the phone. \n\nIt suggests dysfunction so deep that advisers believe stirring up a controversy is potentially more effective at changing the president\u2019s behavior than talking to him, as Nicolle Wallace, who served as White House communications director for President George W. Bush, suggested on Twitter (in conversation with another Bush official, Ari Fleischer):\n\n\n\nWe both know a lot about leaks. Without getting into the merits, (because we likely disagree and Twitter isn\u2019t the place for civil disagreement) can we agree that it was probably someone who was worried that he congratulated Putin and didn\u2019t condemn Russia\u2019s actions in the UK? https://t.co/qwxGFpORDk\n\u2014 Nicolle Wallace (@NicolleDWallace) March 21, 2018\n\n\n\n\nTrump is reportedly furious about the leak and asking his outside advisers who they thought had leaked the information, according to CNN. \n\nThe Washington Post scoop inspired something of an internet moment, as dumbfounded Americans joked about a president who clearly does not know how to listen. \n\nA moment meant to be memed\nTwitter users wasted no time mocking the moment Tuesday night, comparing the call to other infamous scenarios of people not following advice or instructions.\n\nSome tweets compared the call to the ubiquitous \u201cbad pets\u201d pictures \u2014 in which dogs and cats pose innocently with a mess they\u2019ve created.\n\n\nOthers saw similarities to Vice President Mike Pence infamously touching an object with a \u201cDo Not Touch\u201d sign placed across it and Trump looking directly into the sun during the eclipse.\n\n\nThere was a callback to the Oscars in 2017:\n\n\nA new hat for Trump:\n\n\nAnd finally, it\u2019s not a Trump-Russia story without a Simpsons reference.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Ella Nilsen", "body": "Wednesday was a very good day for Democrats and a catastrophic day for Republicans, as Democrat Conor Lamb narrowly edged a win over Republican Rick Saccone in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District. \n\nThe race stretched into Wednesday midday when CNN said Lamb was in the lead by 627 votes with 100 percent of precincts reporting. State law does not mandate a recount in district-level elections. Unless Republicans can successfully challenge him, that means Lamb just pulled off a stunning upset in a district Democrats hadn\u2019t won in more than 10 years.\n\nLamb declared victory early Wednesday morning, introduced as \u201cCongressman-elect\u201d to his crowd of supporters as he took the stage.\n\n\u201cIt took a little longer than we thought, but we did it!\u201d he told them.\n\nLamb\u2019s win has seismic political implications for 2018 and changes what Democrats thought was possible going into a crucial election year. It also says a lot about what messages will and won\u2019t resonate with voters in so-called \u201cTrump country\u201d districts.\n\nWinner: Democratic enthusiasm \nPennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District is a huge win for Democrats. They weren\u2019t just reclaiming territory they had lost to Trump, they were able to push into new, solidly red territory that Republicans had held since 2003. It\u2019s a continuation of the momentum they\u2019ve been building on in special elections throughout 2017, most notably with Sen. Doug Jones winning the special senate race in Alabama \u2014 the first Democrat to do so in 25 years.\n\nJust like with Alabama, it\u2019s worth reminding people that Democrats didn\u2019t even think they could compete in this Pennsylvania district a few months ago. But they had the right candidate, a 33-year-old veteran and federal prosecutor named Conor Lamb. \n\nThe district has Democratic roots; there are technically 70,000 more registered Democrats in the 18th Congressional District than Republicans, but many of those voters have been casting ballots for GOP candidates for years. It\u2019s probably more accurate to think of it as an economic populist district rather than strongly conservative. \n\nIt\u2019s also heavy union territory (a huge demographic for Trump in 2016). Lamb was able to strike the right balance with pro-gun views and moderate messaging on abortion. He is very pro-union, while his Republican opponent Rick Saccone was vehemently anti-union.\n\nSince Trump trounced Hillary Clinton in Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan in 2016, he was able to spin the narrative that the Rust Belt was \u201cTrump country.\u201d But Lamb\u2019s victory turns that on its head. Lamb didn\u2019t make the race about Trump, but he actually ran on many of the same issues Trump did: preserving Medicare and Social Security, fighting the opioid crisis, and protecting pensions for the area\u2019s coal miners. \n\nEspecially as Trump\u2019s administration breaks with many of his 2016 campaign promises (proposing vast cuts to Medicare and doing little to solve America\u2019s drug problem), Democrats will definitely try to replicate Lamb\u2019s playbook to pick up more Rust Belt districts during the 2018 midterms.\n\nWinner: Pro-gun Democrats\nLamb portrayed himself as an independent, moderate Democrat from the beginning, including on the gun issue. In fact, Lamb\u2019s first campaign ad featured footage of him shooting an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle at a gun range, with the narrator voiceover saying the candidate \u201cstill loves to shoot.\u201d\n\nThroughout the campaign, Republicans furiously tried to attack Lamb on the gun issue, painting him as a candidate who would pursue aggressive gun control policies as soon as he got to Washington. But that goes against what Lamb was actually saying. A US Marine Corps veteran, he supports improving the existing background check system but is on the record as not supporting new gun control measures.\n\nBut that\u2019s putting the Democratic Party in a tricky position amid a fresh wave of anti-gun activism led by student survivors of the Parkland, Florida, shooting last month. On Wednesday, thousands of high students staged nationwide walk-outs and protests demanding Congress pass new gun control laws to stop mass shootings. Many Democratic members of Congress joined them in a show of solidarity.\n\n\nAs Democrats try to win back the House in 2018, they\u2019re going to need candidates like Lamb in the mix. More Democratic 2018 candidates are explicitly campaigning on gun control as an issue they believe can win them elections. Lamb\u2019s win could change that calculus in redder districts.\n\nThe big picture is that if Democrats can pull off a decisive win in 2018 and take back Congressional majorities, they could be in a position to vote on gun legislation \u2014 whether it\u2019s strengthening background checks or calling for a full-on assault weapons ban. Who makes up the caucus will determine what kind of legislation gets voted on.\n\nWinner: Pennsylvania redistricting\nWith the amount of national attention and money thrown into this race, it was easy to forget that we all get to do this again in November ... by which time PA-18 will be a completely different district.\n\nThat\u2019s because a few weeks ago, Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that the state\u2019s congressional map Republicans drew in 2010 was unconstitutionally partisan. After some back and forth between the Republican-controlled state legislature and Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, the duty to redraw the maps was kicked back to the state Supreme Court, which released a new map a few weeks ago.\n\nHere\u2019s the old map. PA-18 is the district in the bottom left-hand corner.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Wikipedia\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nAnd here\u2019s the new map. If you notice, PA-18 and PA-14 have essentially switched places (among other changes). The biggest change is that PA-18 will contain much more of liberal Pittsburgh and less of the conservative counties that kept the district represented by Republicans for 15 years. It will go from being a Republican stronghold (that a Democrat just won) to a swing district.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Wikipedia\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThe new map has cleaner lines, splits fewer counties, and will likely lead to many more competitive elections. This is certainly better for Democrats, but due to the degree the state was gerrymandered to benefit Republicans, it\u2019s more accurate to think of this redrawing as leveling out the balance rather than a Democratic gerrymander. \n\nThe 18th District was drawn to keep a Democrat from winning it, but Lamb did it anyways. Pennsylvania Republicans are challenging the new map. But if it stays, Lamb likely will breeze through his November race with a much more favorable district.\n\nLoser: President Donald Trump\nTrump really, really cared about Republicans winning PA-18, a district that was solid \u201cTrump country.\u201d (He won it by 20 points in 2016.) And Saccone tried to style himself as a Trump-like candidate, declaring himself \u201cTrump before Trump was Trump.\u201d \n\nTrump cared enough about Saccone getting the seat to join the Republican candidate on the campaign trail multiple times, as well as sending Vice President Mike Pence and members of his family. Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump both stumped for Saccone around the district. Trump even pushed a controversial announcement on steel and aluminum import tariffs to land a week before the special election. (Polling by Monmouth University found tariffs barely registered before Election Day.) \n\nRepublicans and conservative groups poured a deluge of cash into the PA-18 race so they wouldn\u2019t embarrass themselves by losing a district that they had easily hung onto for more than a decade. But for Trump, the impetus was much more personal. \n\nTrump\u2019s push wasn\u2019t about Saccone, it was about hanging onto \u201cTrump country\u201d in Southwestern Pennsylvania \u2014 and with it, the very narrative about Rust Belt voters that put him in the White House. Lamb\u2019s win was a huge blow to that narrative, and likely \u2014 for a president who cares so much about loyalty \u2014 Trump\u2019s pride.\n\nLoser: GOP tax cuts (reform)\n\nCongressional Republicans insisted their tax cuts would help them win elections. That didn\u2019t work out in PA-18, a working-class district that should have been the model for tax cut success.\n\nAt first, Republicans went all in on their tax cut messaging. For weeks, the bill was the subject of countless ads and consumed Saccone\u2019s talking points on the trail. Trump even came to the state for a conveniently located GOP tax rally in Western Pennsylvania in January, which the White House insisted was not directly related to Saccone\u2019s candidacy.\n\nThat didn\u2019t last, but it\u2019s not necessarily because the tax bill is unpopular \u2014 it\u2019s more that there\u2019s just too many other things going on and it\u2019s tough for voters to stay focused. Since Republican passed the tax bill in December, it has generally grown in popularity \u2014 but in Pennsylvania, it wasn\u2019t enough to secure Saccone a stable lead in the polls.\n\nAt the beginning of February, almost two-thirds of GOP ads were about the Republican tax law, according to a Politico analysis. By election day, the same groups had pivoted sharply to decrying so-called sanctuary cities, as Politico reported:\n\nSince the beginning of March, tax ads have been essentially non-existent. Only two are on the air now \u2014 one from the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action which briefly mentions the tax law, and a radio ad from a progressive group attacking Saccone for supporting the law.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Republicans are going to stop messaging on taxes for the 2018 midterms. They were all but doubling down during a GOP press conference on Capitol Hill Wednesday.\n\n\n\n.@cathymcmorris starts off the GOP press conference today with a comment on Pennsylvania: says it\u2019s important not to make \u201csweeping predictions\u201d and that we\u2019re \u201cnot even in full momentum on tax reform\u201d\n\u2014 Tara Golshan (@taragolshan) March 14, 2018\n\n\n\n\nLoser: Egregious campaign spending\nImagine you had $7 million. Now imagine taking a match and lighting that $7 million on fire. That\u2019s essentially what Republicans did in PA-18. \n\nRepublicans and conservative-allied groups heavily outspent the Democrats throughout the race, even though Lamb outraised Saccone by a substantial amount. After Saccone\u2019s campaign showed a lackluster fundraising effort, outside Republican groups \u2014 including the national campaign arm for House Republicans \u2014 jumped in to get Saccone over the finish line.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, as of February 27, Saccone\u2019s campaign and allied groups had spent a total of $9.1 million on the race, between the Congressional Leadership Fund, the National Republican Congressional Committee, and others. Meanwhile, Democratic groups and labor unions had spent less than $1 million.\n\nThe official campaign arm for House Republicans reported spending another $619,664 on media ahead of the March 13 election for Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District House seat, bringing the total to $3.5 million on media buys as of last week in a last-minute panic.\n\nAnd even if Republicans had been successful in this last-minute cash push, it\u2019s important to remember that the winner will hold onto the seat for less than a year and the race\u2019s outcome didn\u2019t determine the control the House of Representatives. The sheer amount of spending was, largely, pointless. \n\nGiven that they weren\u2019t successful, the GOP may be forced to reconsider its messaging and recruitment. Clearly, money didn\u2019t get them very far in this race.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Joseph Blocher", "body": "The great American gun debate has long been conducted at the national level \u2014 as we will see, once again, at Saturday\u2019s March for Our Lives event in Washington, DC \u2014 but in many ways it is also deeply rooted in local experiences. \n\nIndeed, the touchstones of the debate are a series of place names. Columbine. Sandy Hook. San Bernardino. Aurora. Orlando. Las Vegas. Each of the attacks that occurred in those towns and cities triggered waves of discussion about how regulation might reduce the tens of thousands of shootings that occur in the United States every year. But those waves crashed and receded, and federal law remains fundamentally unchanged.\n\nThe Parkland mass shooting has set off another wave. There is some reason to believe that it will end differently than the others \u2014 that there will be marginal steps toward gun regulations, perhaps including limitations on high capacity magazines, a ban on \u201cbump stocks\u201d (which allow semiautomatic weapons to fire more rapidly), and restrictions on sales to minors. \n\nBut hopes were high in the wake of Sandy Hook, too, and Congress basically did nothing. How can supporters of reasonable gun regulation avoid similar disappointment this time around? \n\nOne partial solution is to look for answers closer to home. If we are stalemated at the national level, might we pursue gun regulations tailored to local experiences, preferences, and needs? Thoughtful policy suggests, and our traditions and Constitution support, this kind of \u201cfirearm localism.\u201d It could help us find a way out of the current policy impasse. \n\nWhy localism?\nA basic goal of regulation is to maximize public safety while minimizing costs to individual liberty, and one way to do that is by tailoring rules to places or situations where they\u2019re likely to do the most good. When it comes to guns, that often means drawing distinctions between urban and rural areas.\n\nGun violence is disproportionately concentrated in densely populated areas. Roughly 60 percent of American gun homicides occur in the nation\u2019s 50 largest metro areas. In Connecticut, for example, 67 percent of gun homicides occur in just three cities, which together account for just 11 percent of the state\u2019s population. \n\nOn the flip side, the benefits of gun use are disproportionately rural. People in rural areas are far more likely to grow up with guns, and to use them for hunting and recreation. They might also face longer police response times, and so feel an increased need for a firearm in the home as a matter of personal safety. \n\nA deadly exception to the overall cost-benefits calculation is suicide. Self-killing, which accounts for most gun deaths, is a disproportionately rural phenomenon, and until recently has been largely ignored in public discussions about guns. That seems to be changing, at least to some degree. Even so, the types of responses and regulations that might help address gun suicides \u2014 including the push for \u201cfirearm choice\u201d laws (which allow people to put themselves, voluntarily, on \u201cdo not sell-to\u201d lists) \u2014 are very different than those relevant to the problem of homicides in urban areas.\n\nGiven these different experiences, it\u2019s unsurprising that supporters of stricter gun regulation tend to be highly concentrated in cities and relatively rare in rural areas, and also that advocates and opponents of such regulation sound (and feel) as if they\u2019re talking to across deep cultural divides. Even in gun-friendly states like Texas, the differences can be stark, with urban poll respondents nearly twice as likely to say they favor stricter gun laws.\n\nPooling the preferences of urban and rural areas leads to less overall satisfaction than more local approaches. Pitting those preferences against each other isn\u2019t always necessary, let alone productive. A more localized approach could satisfy the preferences of more people without necessarily increasing the total amount of regulation. \n\nTo slightly modify a thought experiment used by the Stanford law professor (and former federal judge) Michael McConnell: Consider two jurisdictions, urban place A and rural locale B. Each is deciding whether to pass a particular gun regulation, and each has 100 residents. \n\nIn the urban area A, 70 people support the regulation; in rural area B, 40 do. \n\nIf they are required to reach a decision collectively, the regulation will pass and 110 people will be satisfied. But if they can choose for themselves, A will regulate, B will not, and 130 people will be satisfied. \n\nOur forebears understood this calculus. American gun laws have historically been tailored to local conditions. In the era of our nation\u2019s founding, regulations in major cities like Boston and New York effectively made it impossible for people to keep loaded guns in their homes, even as those living outside the city limits could and did rely on guns for hunting and self-protection. \n\nAs the nation expanded westward, the urban-rural division went with it. Even the cow towns of the supposedly wild West had gun laws far more strict than those found in any American jurisdiction today. In places like Dodge City, Kansas, and Tombstone, Arizona, people were required to check their guns at the city limits. (The famed shootout at the OK Corral was sparked in part by the Earp brothers\u2019 attempt to disarm members of the Cowboys gang, who were violating Tombstone\u2019s gun ordinance.)\n\nAll of this raises the question: If firearm localism makes sense as a policy matter, tracks political preferences, and is consistent with American history and tradition, why isn\u2019t the debate more focused on local solutions?\n\nHow the Second Amendment affects the argument for varying laws by locale\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller said most \u201clongstanding\u201d gun laws were \u201cpresumptively\u201d constitutional. Cities have historically had tighter gun laws than rural towns.\n      \n      \n        Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nOf course, there\u2019s a constitutional constraint on local variation: the right to keep and bear arms guaranteed by the Second Amendment. That right, as interpreted in binding Supreme Court precedent, forbids sweeping gun regulations. In fact, the Court\u2019s two major Second Amendment decisions, District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) and McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010), struck down municipal handgun bans. \n\nAnd yet the Second Amendment is not incompatible with firearm localism (as I have argued elsewhere, at greater length). For one thing, the vast majority of politically plausible gun regulations raise no serious Second Amendment questions. The kinds of state or local laws that might emerge from the current wave of the gun debate, such as age restrictions, limitations on high capacity magazines, even bans on \u201cassault weapons\u201d (however defined), are overwhelmingly likely to be deemed constitutional by the courts. \n\nEven Justice Scalia\u2019s landmark opinion in Heller, which held that the right to keep and bear arms includes certain private purposes like self-defense against crime \u2014 and not only collective defense of the sort that a state militia provides \u2014 did not rule out such restrictions. Justice Scalia wrote that \u201clongstanding\u201d gun laws were \u201cpresumptively\u201d constitutional, referring to laws banning \u201cdangerous and unusual weapons.\u201d \n\nSince Heller, more than 1,000 Second Amendment challenges have been filed, and more than 90 percent of the challenges have failed. Many of those challenges involved the kinds of longstanding gun laws that Scalia had in mind. But it\u2019s also the case that no feature of American gun regulation is more longstanding than the stricter regulation of guns in cities.\n\nThere is also no reason to think cities are eager to push beyond what the Constitution is currently held to permit. Note that even when the Supreme Court allowed handgun bans, DC and Chicago were the only two major cities to adopt them. \n\nIn any event, cities cannot exempt themselves from the Second Amendment. Federal constitutional rights are national rights for a reason. But the precise contours of those rights vary from place to place. No one doubts that freedom of speech is a nationwide right, for example, but what counts as \u201cobscenity,\u201d and therefore lacks constitutional coverage, is defined in part by community standards. \n\nThe due process clauses protect property as a matter of federal constitutional law, but state law defines what counts as property in the first place. Gun rights might be subject to the same kind of at-the-margins tailoring. \n\nThat leaves the most serious legal obstacle to firearm localism: the widespread, and relatively recent, adoption by state legislatures of \u201cpreemption\u201d laws that limit or outright forbid municipal gun control. Thanks in part to an NRA-supported push beginning in the 1980s, more than 42 states have enacted broad firearm preemption laws. These laws are a far more significant impediment to local regulation, and to gun regulation more generally, than the Second Amendment. Their effect has been to force cities to have the same generally permissive rules as rural areas do. \n\nBroad preemption laws prevent carefully tailored gun policy, they limit community self-governance, they break from longstanding American tradition, and they make compromise even harder in a debate in which common ground already seems hard to find. They should be repealed or revised to permit the kinds of local solutions suggested by policy, politics, tradition, and the Constitution.\n\nNational crises lead many people to look to Washington for solutions. That\u2019s not always the best course.\nThinking about firearms localism requires a shift in mindset. As with many other regulatory issues, some people instinctively look to the federal government for answers. Democrats, who are far more likely to support both gun regulation and federal action, may be particularly susceptible to this reflex. And, to be fair, there are some kinds of gun regulation, including background checks and manufacturing requirements, that depend on a degree of national uniformity. \n\nBut, practically speaking, many bread-and-butter regulations can be passed and enforced at the local level. Permit requirements for public carrying, bans on particular kinds of weaponry and equipment (high-capacity magazines or assault weapons, say), age restrictions, and so on can be jurisdiction-specific and enforced locally without the need for nationwide coordination.\n\nOf course, regulatory choices in other jurisdictions might blunt the effectiveness of these local rules. New York\u2019s comparatively stringent gun laws are partially undermined by the \u201cIron Pipeline\u201d through which guns flow from gun-friendly states like Virginia and North Carolina. \n\nBut those kinds of spillover effects simply create a practical limitation on the effectiveness of local tailoring; they aren\u2019t an argument against it. Moreover, some policies are not as susceptible to externalities. A ban on open carrying in New York City can be enforced on the spot regardless of what North Carolina chooses to do.  \n\nGun rights supporters have often succeeded by thinking two steps ahead: Not just winning particular battles, but establishing favorable terrain on which to fight \u2014 and the passage of the preemption laws is a perfect example. \n\nAdvocates of reasonable gun regulation can do the same. And the strongest terrain, it turns out, may be close to home.\n\nJoseph Blocher is a professor at Duke Law School, and the author of the Yale Law Journal article \u201cFirearm Localism\u201d \n\n\nThe Big Idea is Vox\u2019s home for smart discussion of the most important issues and ideas in politics, science, and culture \u2014 typically by outside contributors.

Gen. H.R. McMaster began his tenure as national security adviser as one of the most celebrated military leaders of his generation. But President Donald Trump just fired him after just over a year in the administration \u2014 leaving McMaster\u2019s once-sterling reputation in tatters and the White House in even more disarray.\n\nIn a tweet, Trump announced that McMaster would make way for former UN Ambassador John Bolton, but that McMaster \u201cwill always remain my friend.\u201d\n\nOn March 15, the Washington Post reported that Trump decided to oust McMaster, but didn\u2019t do so because he wanted to ensure there was a prominent successor in place and that McMaster has his next job lined up. But now Trump finally followed through.\n\nMcMaster follows closely behind Rex Tillerson, who Trump fired on March 13. Hours after Tillerson\u2019s removal, McMaster told a reporter \u201cHey, I\u2019m still around.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to end this way. McMaster \u2014 along with Defense Secretary James Mattis and, at the time, Tillerson \u2014 was labeled an \u201cadult\u201d in the room whose military and strategic expertise would help him gain Trump\u2019s trust and moderate the president\u2019s most potentially dangerous foreign policy impulses. \n\nInstead, McMaster soon found himself at odds with both the president and other top administration officials. Trump, for example, pushed back hard against McMaster on crucial national security decisions, particularly the decision to escalate the war in Afghanistan. \n\nTrump also publicly lambasted McMaster for saying that the evidence Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election was \u201cincontrovertible\u201d \u2014 a fact the president repeatedly denies. And McMaster also advocated for a more militaristic stance toward North Korea, consistently warning that time was running out before a potential war with Pyongyang.\n\nBut McMaster perhaps struggled most simply dealing with Trump. A National Security Council (NSC) staffer who worked with McMaster and is not authorized to speak publicly about internal matters told me that no policy decision Trump took was ever final until it was actually implemented. \n\nIn other words, it was hard for McMaster and his team to put a policy into place because the president\u2019s wishes sometimes changed on a dime. That, in part, made it difficult for McMaster to simply do his job.\n\nPlus, according to the Post, Trump didn\u2019t like McMaster\u2019s style: \u201cThe president has complained that McMaster is too rigid and that his briefings go on too long and seem irrelevant.\u201d \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that if another person was occupying the position right now, that they\u2019d be doing a markedly better job,\u201d Jake Sullivan, who was considered a lock to be Hillary Clinton\u2019s national security adviser had she won the election, told me before the firing announcement.\n\nTrump\u2019s personal flaws aside, McMaster made errors of his own. For example, he publicly offered a widely scrutinized non-denial denial that Trump shared classified intelligence with Russians in the Oval Office.\n\nSo an Iraq War veteran who famously wrote that military advisers should speak truth to power and act honorably \u2014 especially when it was hard \u2014 lasted about a year in the Trump White House. Worse still, McMaster\u2019s hard-earned reputation will be irreparably damaged by his association with Trump.\n\n\u201cWith the possible exception of Henry Kissinger holding the NSC together while Nixon was flailing during Watergate, it would be hard to imagine a genuinely successful national security adviser with a failing president,\u201d William Inboden, a top NSC staffer in the George W. Bush administration, told me. \u201cThe fate of the two are so linked.\u201d\n\nMcMaster wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s first pick\nMcMaster was not Trump\u2019s first choice to be national security adviser. That was Michael Flynn, a retired three-star Army general who strongly supported Trump during the campaign. But after only 24 days in the role, Trump fired Flynn because he lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his communications with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak after the election \u2014 a personnel move Trump still regrets having to make. \n\n(Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election.)\n\nTrump then tried to lure retired Navy Vice Adm. Robert Harward, a Lockheed Martin executive, to take Flynn\u2019s place. But Harward turned the offer down because the White House wouldn\u2019t let him put his own team together. So the search continued until Trump heeded the advice of Armed Services Committee Chair Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK), and Mattis, who all said the president should pick McMaster.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man of tremendous talent and tremendous experience,\u201d Trump said during the unveiling of McMaster as his new national security adviser on February 20, 2017. \u201cI watched and read a lot over the last two days. He is highly respected by everyone in the military, and we\u2019re very honored to have him.\u201d\n\n\nMcMaster was one of the few Trump appointments to draw praise from Democrats and Republicans alike. Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI), the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said McMaster had \u201ca reputation for courage and candor.\u201d Bill Kristol, a conservative critic of the administration, tweeted \u201cI can't imagine anyone better prepared for the challenges of being Trump's NSA than H.R. McMaster.\u201d Michael McFaul, a former ambassador to Russia under President Barack Obama, tweeted \u201cI have a lot of respect for H.R.\u201d\n\nThe acclaim stemmed, in part, from McMaster\u2019s image as a warrior-scholar. McMaster\u2019s only book, Dereliction of Duty, is a bestselling history on the Vietnam War which concludes that President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s military advisers should have pushed the administration harder to adopt their assessments and recommendations for the conflict. Had Johnson listened to them, McMaster argues, America might have done better in Southeast Asia. \u201cThe war in Vietnam was not lost in the field, nor was it lost on the front pages of the New York Times or the college campuses,\u201d McMaster wrote. \u201cIt was lost in Washington, DC.\u201d \n\nMany inside and outside the White House expected that McMaster would get the National Security Council in order, work closely with other cabinet members like Mattis and Tillerson, and offer his unvarnished military advice to the president. \n\nEarly on, at least, McMaster offered some reasons for optimism. On April 5, 2017, just over a month into the job, he removed former top Trump aide Steve Bannon from the NSC \u2014 political aides haven\u2019t historically been allowed to attend \u2014 and returned Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford to their historic roles as \u201cregular attendees\u201d of the gatherings.\n\nThe next day, Trump authorized a Tomahawk missile strike against a Syrian base that Bashar al-Assad had used to mount a chemical weapons attack against his own citizens; McMaster helped guide the decision-making process, which was widely-praised. He also removed some of Flynn\u2019s staff holdovers, most notably his then-deputy K.T. McFarland, who had drawn criticism for inexperience and acting as a partisan in a famously apolitical role.\n\nBut by May, internal squabbles started to play out in public. The biggest problem was McMaster recommended Trump send more troops to Afghanistan \u2014 advice that initially rankled many in the White House, most notably Trump himself.\n\nTrump and McMaster didn\u2019t see eye to eye on most things\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        US President Donald Trump (L) and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster (R) walk on the South Lawn prior to a Marine One departure from the White House June 16, 2017 in Washington, DC.\n      \n      \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nDuring a mid-July meeting, McMaster put forward a plan to send up to 3,900 new US troops to bolster the Afghan government in its flagging fight against the Taliban (at the time, there were about 8,400 American troops already in the country).\n\nThe meeting was a \u201cshitshow,\u201d according to a July 24, 2017 Politico report, as Trump rejected McMaster\u2019s plan and \u201cwords were exchanged.\u201d The president was wary of spending more blood and treasure in Afghanistan, especially when the US had lost around 2,400 troops and civilians since the war began in October 2001 and failed to deal a body blow to the Taliban. The extremist group controls, influences, or contests more than 40 percent of the country.\n\nMcMaster\u2019s enemies in the administration, at the time led by Bannon, took advantage of Trump\u2019s displeasure with McMaster\u2019s Afghanistan proposal. They mockingly dubbed the fight in Central Asia as \u201cMcMaster\u2019s War\u201d, and ruthlessly attacked the national security adviser during the Afghanistan debate to ruin his standing with the president.\n\n\u201cOn policy, the faction of the White House loyal to senior strategist Steve Bannon is convinced McMaster is trying to trick the president into the kind of nation building that Trump campaigned against,\u201d Bloomberg View\u2019s Eli Lake wrote on May 8, 2017.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubting that Trump was reluctant to deepen America\u2019s involvement in what was already the longest war in US history. But on August 21, 2017, Trump took McMaster\u2019s advice and ordered more US troops to Afghanistan \u2014 even though it went against his initial beliefs.\n\n\u201cMy original instinct was to pull out \u2014 and, historically, I like following my instincts,\u201d Trump told a military crowd at Fort Myer, which is near Arlington Cemetery. \u201cBut all my life I\u2019ve heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office; in other words, when you\u2019re president of the United States.\u201d\n\nAfghanistan wasn\u2019t the only time Trump and McMaster were at odds. Last May, Trump said that South Korea would have to pay for the THAAD missile defense system, which Seoul wants to protect itself from North Korea\u2019s ever-improving missile and nuclear programs. Trump promptly screamed at McMaster over the phone for contradicting him.\n\nTrump was also expected to use a speech at NATO\u2019s headquarters on May 25, 2017 to specifically endorse the alliance\u2019s article 5 provision, which calls for collective defense and says that an attack on any NATO nation is considered to be an attack on all of them. In advance of the speech, McMaster expected Trump to read language underscoring America\u2019s support for article 5. Instead, Trump omitted those 27 words, sparking new doubts about his commitment to the military alliance.\n\nTrump also met with Russian President Vladimir Putin during last July\u2019s G20 meeting in Hamburg, Germany, despite McMaster\u2019s objections. While national security advisers usually attend those bilaterals, only Tillerson accompanied Trump. \n\nAnd in February 2018, McMaster told an audience at the Munich Security Conference that Russia had meddled in the 2016 presidential election. \u201cThe evidence is now really incontrovertible and available in the public domain, whereas in the past it was difficult to attribute,\u201d McMaster said in his remarks. \n\nTrump quickly tweeted his displeasure with the comments, stating that \u201cGeneral McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians.\u201d\n\n\n\nGeneral McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nIt also didn\u2019t help that the three-star\u2019s persistent chatter during meetings annoyed Trump, according to the New York Times last May. During some of them, McMaster tried to correct or add color to what the president was saying \u2014 with Trump right there. \n\nMcMaster did have some successes, however. Besides the Syria strike, McMaster helped to guide Trump\u2019s thinking about North Korea. The three-star believed the US could not deter North Korean leader Kim Jong Un from continuing to expand his nuclear weapons program, and argued that the chance for war grew with each passing day. \u201cWe\u2019re in a race, really, to able to solve this problem,\u201d McMaster said during the last December\u2019s Reagan National Defense Forum.\n\nMcMaster argued that the only way to change Kim\u2019s mind was with the threat \u2014 and possible use \u2014 of military force. For months, rumors swirled that the administration had developed a plan for a so-called \u201cbloody nose\u201d strike. The plan was widely viewed as McMaster\u2019s brainchild, although top officials deny that a \u201cbloody nose\u201d strike was ever an option.\n\nBut if the administration chooses to move forward with any military moves against North Korea, it will do so without McMaster in the White House.\n\n\u201cMcMaster couldn\u2019t keep riding the tiger\u201d\n\nNo one questions McMaster\u2019s intellect. The problem was he always seemed out of his depths as Trump\u2019s top national security adviser. After all, he spent his life in the military and not much time dealing with Washington politics.\n\nAfter Trump shared highly sensitive intelligence about an ISIS plot with top Russian officials on May 10, 2017, McMaster twice publicly defended the president\u2019s actions. He didn\u2019t deny that Trump had actually given that intelligence to an adversary and possibly put an Israeli spy \u2014 who was reportedly deep under cover in an ISIS cell \u2014 in danger.\n\nInstead, McMaster claimed what Trump did was \u201cwholly appropriate\u201d and even acknowledged that Trump didn\u2019t know where the intelligence he shared came from. That\u2019s not something a seasoned political hand says to explain away why the president made a potentially costly mistake. \n\nMcMaster later spoke during a June 28 Center for a New American Security conference in a keynote address. Trying to defend Trump\u2019s foreign policy is tough enough. But McMaster\u2019s insistence that Trump\u2019s criticism of European allies stemmed from \u201ctough love\u201d sparked literal laughter from the crowd. \n\nMichele Flournoy, the event\u2019s moderator and a well-respected national security professional, pushed back on the comment. \u201cI can tell you that they are not feeling very loved at the moment,\u201d she said, prompting more laughter. \u201cThey\u2019re feeling the tough part, but not the love part.\u201d\n\nMcMaster also helped write two stunningly partisan op-eds on the administration\u2019s purported policy accomplishments, which raised eyebrows because uniformed military officers are supposed to strictly stay clear of politics. His co-author was Gary Cohn, Trump\u2019s then-top economic adviser, who resigned earlier this month.\n\nThe two men defended the president\u2019s first foreign trip to the Middle East and Europe in the Wall Street Journal on May 30, 2017, claiming Trump\u2019s presence and actions showed just how willing America wanted to work with allies and partners. That was the same trip where Trump refused to commit to NATO\u2019s article 5, alarming key US allies around the world.\n\nAnd in the July 13, 2017 New York Times piece, they argued America\u2019s foreign policy was going well, and that Trump got what he wanted out of the G20 meetings. But that\u2019s not how many who tuned into the gathering saw it. Putin outplayed Trump when the Russian leader got the president to accept his narrative that Moscow didn\u2019t interfere in the election. The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, even called it a \u201cdiplomatic depantsing.\u201d\n\nSo while serving Trump is surely difficult, understanding McMaster\u2019s downfall would be incomplete without noting that the general \u2014 as talented as he is \u2014 made some critical mistakes along the way.\n\n\u201cUnless an adviser\u2019s policy recommendations and administrative style coincide with the president\u2019s own immediate emotions and interests, there is great potential for conflict,\u201d Bartholomew Sparrow, who wrote a book about former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, told me. \u201cThere was an accumulation of serious differences in substance and process to make the relationship unsustainable. McMaster couldn\u2019t keep riding the tiger.\u201d \n\nMcMaster\u2019s time as national security adviser may not have amounted to a dereliction of duty, but the general definitely didn\u2019t meet the standards he had set for others.

The report comes a day after Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe two days before he planned to formally retire, a move that could strip him of his pension. McCabe said the vindictive act was the result of the role he played in the aftermath of former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s departure, who also infamously kept memos about his interactions with Trump. McCabe added that the president\u2019s directive was an effort to slander him as well as to \u201ctaint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally.\u201d McCabe, who turns 50 on Sunday, stepped down as deputy director of the FBI in January but hadn\u2019t planned to formally retire until March 18th, his 50th birthday. \n\nMcCabe kept memos similar to the ones maintained by Comey, according to the Associated Press, citing a person with direct knowledge of the situation. The memos reportedly include details of interactions with the president and other topics, and it\u2019s not clear if any have been turned over to or requested by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nComey told the Senate Intelligence Committee last June he kept memos about his interactions with Trump because he was worried the president would lie about them. One of the memos, which was initially reported by the New York Times in May 2017, said that the president encouraged Comey to drop the investigation into ousted National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. A federal judge in February rejected requests from news organizations to obtain all of Comey\u2019s memos. \n\nMcCabe\u2019s firing isn\u2019t supposed to be political, but it looks anything but.\nThe controversy around McCabe stems in part from yet-to-be-released findings by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general; the case alleges that McCabe misled investigators about allowing two top FBI officials to talk to reporters about his decision to open a case into the Clinton Foundation. But Trump and Republicans have for months attacked McCabe over what they say are his wife\u2019s compromising political ties to Hillary Clinton. (McCabe\u2019s wife ran for a state Senate seat in Virginia and received donations from the state\u2019s Democratic Party and a Clinton ally.)\n\nOn Friday, McCabe hit back in a fiery statement on Friday in which he said he was being \u201csingled out and treated this way\u201d because of what he did and saw after former FBI Director Comey was fired in May 2017. He said the \u201cbig picture\u201d is a tale of what can happen when law enforcement is politicized. Betsy Woodruff at the Daily Beast on Saturday reported that the former deputy FBI director has hired attorney Michael Bromwich of the Bromwich Group to represent him. Given reports of the memos, McCabe\u2019s statement, and his decision to lawyer up, it appears that the battle over his ouster is far from over. \n\nSoon after news of the McCabe memos broke, President Trump \u2014 who on Friday night celebrated McCabe\u2019s firing as a \u201cgreat day for democracy\u201d \u2014 tweeted that the House Intelligence Committee had concluded there was \u201cno collusion\u201d between Russia and the Trump campaign. (House Republicans came up with those findings; not Democrats.) He also continued his attack on the Justice Department and the FBI, where he alleged there was \u201ctremendous leaking, lying, and corruption.\u201d There is no evidence of a widespread campaign against Trump at the Justice Department or the FBI.\n\n\n\nAs the House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign.

Those funds go toward things like US scholarships for promising foreign students, in hopes they develop a closer bond with the US through their study. \nTrump\u2019s budget proposal is unlikely to become a reality. But its radical rejection of the State Department\u2019s mission is useful for understanding the White House\u2019s foreign policy priorities.

Francis Cissna bragged about the change \u2014 saying that USCIS wasn\u2019t supposed to help immigrants and the US citizens seeking to sponsor them, but rather \u201cthe American people.\u201d\n\nThe new mission statement, and Cissna\u2019s justification, downplays the agency\u2019s commitment to helping immigrants become American citizens and plays up the idea that US citizens attempting to bring their family members to the US don\u2019t count as real Americans whose interests deserve to be protected.\n\nUSCIS\u2019s new mission statement doesn\u2019t just reflect the Trump administration\u2019s hawkishness toward legal as well as unauthorized immigration. It encourages the notion that Americanness is a matter of blood and soil, of birth and descent, rather than an idea that anyone can be proud of regardless of where they were born.\n\nTaking \u201ccitizenship\u201d out of the mission of Citizenship and Immigration Services\nThe changes to the USCIS mission statement don\u2019t change the work the agency actually does. But they make a symbolic statement that the Trump administration sees that work differently not just from how the Obama administration did, but from our traditional understanding of what Americanness means.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the removal of the \u201cnation of immigrants\u201d line. The new mission statement removes all references to citizenship \u2014 instead of \u201cimmigration and citizenship benefits,\u201d USCIS now just provides \u201cimmigration benefits,\u201d and \u201cpromoting an awareness and understanding of citizenship\u201d is kicked out of the mission entirely.\n\nAt the same time as the agency is deemphasizing the part of its job that involves turning immigrants into citizens, its new mission implies that the two groups \u2014 immigrants and Americans \u2014 are naturally in conflict:\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services administers the nation\u2019s lawful immigration system, safeguarding its integrity and promise by efficiently and fairly adjudicating requests for immigration benefits while protecting Americans, securing the homeland, and honoring our values.\n\nCissna\u2019s email also told USCIS staff that they\u2019re not supposed to call applicants \u201ccustomers\u201d anymore because their real customers aren\u2019t immigrants \u2014 they\u2019re the American people:\n\nReferring to applicants and petitioners for immigration benefits, and the beneficiaries of such applications and petitions, as \u2018customers\u2019 promotes an institutional culture that emphasizes the ultimate satisfaction of applicants and petitioners, rather than the correct adjudication of such applications and petitions according to the law. [...] Use of the term leads to the erroneous belief that applicants and petitioners, rather than the American people, are whom we ultimately serve.\u201d [emphasis added]\n\nIt\u2019s an odd statement to make. For one thing, USCIS is the rare federal agency that isn\u2019t primarily funded through taxes \u2014 most of the money to run the agency comes from application fees. Immigrants applying for visas, green cards, and citizenship \u2014 and the US citizens and companies that have to sponsor some of those applications \u2014 are paying USCIS for the services they provide. By a commonsense definition, that\u2019s what a customer is.\n\nBut what\u2019s even more jarring than the redefinition of \u201ccustomer\u201d is the definition of \u201cAmerican.\u201d Cissna\u2019s statement strongly implies that \u201capplicants and petitioners\u201d don\u2019t count as part of the \u201cAmerican people.\u201d That might make sense if he were talking just about people newly coming to the US, or even if he were distinguishing \u201cAmericans\u201d from noncitizens. But he\u2019s not. \n\nThe \u201capplicants\u201d Cissna refers to include immigrants who are applying for US citizenship \u2014 the part of USCIS\u2019s function that got stripped out of the mission statement. Not only does the new mission statement suggest that helping immigrants become Americans is no longer part of USCIS\u2019 job, but by distinguishing \u201capplicants\u201d from \u201cthe American people,\u201d it suggests that they can\u2019t.\n\nFurthermore, the overwhelming majority of petitioners for immigrants are US citizens petitioning for family members (or American businesses petitioning for employees). Those citizens may have been born abroad, but they\u2019ve naturalized. They are as American as anyone else. \n\nDoes the Trump administration believe immigrants can integrate?\nUSCIS tends to be the most obscure of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s three immigration agencies, precisely because it\u2019s the one that doesn\u2019t deal with immigration enforcement (Customs and Border Protection addresses border enforcement; Immigration and Customs Enforcement takes care of interior enforcement). But immigrant rights advocates have been worried about the agency. \n\nCissna worked for Senate Judiciary Committee Chair (and immigration hawk) Chuck Grassley (R-IA) before being appointed to USCIS. The agency\u2019s ombudsman office, which is supposed to provide transparency to the people who used to be called \u201ccustomers,\u201d is headed by Julie Kirchner, the former executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform \u2014 a group whose mission includes reducing legal immigration to the US.\n\nThere are already indications that the new leadership is encouraging applications to be processed more slowly and with more scrutiny. In winding down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, they were more aggressive than Trump\u2019s statements implied. At the same time, there\u2019s been an apparent slowdown in the processing of naturalization applications and of work permits for some categories of immigrants.\n\nBy overhauling the mission statement, it\u2019s clear that the new leadership wants to be noticed.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Zachary Fryer-biggs", "body": "When Mike Conaway (R-TX) decided to end the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s Russia investigation last week by saying the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia, it vaulted the little known Republican into the spotlight. \n\nConaway, a soft-spoken accountant and representative of a rural district of Texas, has been at the helm of the year-long investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election since last April.\n\nHe took over the probe after the committee\u2019s chair, Devin Nunes (R-CA), stepped aside on April 6. Nunes recused himself from the Russia investigation after the House Ethics Committee began looking into allegations that Nunes had revealed classified information, as part of a campaign against intelligence officials. \n\nNunes, a bombastic lawmaker who is a close ally of President Donald Trump, had accused intelligence agencies of spying on Trump\u2019s campaign and of bias against the president in March 2017. The Ethics Committee cleared Nunes in December, saying he hadn\u2019t revealed any classified information, but Conaway remained at the head of the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation \u2014 despite rumors that Nunes was still the one making the decisions.\n\nLast week, Conaway said he was shutting down the House investigation, arguing that all necessary evidence on the Trump campaign\u2019s contacts with Russian officials had been reviewed.\n\nThe committee is planning to vote on its final report Thursday, and that report is expected to exonerate the Trump campaign from any wrongdoing. Democrats are already preparing to issue a rebuttal.\n\nDemocrats had expected that Conaway would be an improvement over Nunes, and voiced hope that he could lead a bipartisan investigation. But that didn\u2019t end up happening. And now Conaway is now preparing to issue a highly partisan report that defends the Trump campaign, just as Nunes did.\n\nWho is Mike Conaway?\nBefore publicly taking over the Russia probe, Conaway was mostly known for his focus on government spending and financial discipline. He was one of the House leaders pushing the Pentagon to produce accounting reports for its $600 billion budget, and he serves on the House Armed Services Committee in addition to his position on the Intelligence Committee.\n\nHis work on military budgets ties together two parts of his background.\n\nAfter graduating from college with a degree in accounting, Conaway joined the Army reserve in 1970. He spent two years at Fort Hood Army Base in Texas during the Vietnam War, and then became a professional accountant.\n\nHis accounting career kickstarted his political life. Conaway was the chief financial officer for Bush Exploration, the oil firm run by President George W. Bush before Bush became governor of Texas. After Bush won the governorship, he appointed Conaway to the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy. Conaway served on the board for seven years before running for Congress in 2003 and losing by 587 votes, and then running again in 2004 after Texas\u2019 congressional districts were redrawn. \n\nConaway has never won less than 70 percent of the vote from his conservative Texas district in his six reelection bids since, and due to seniority, is the second highest ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee.\n\nConaway took over the Russia probe, but Nunes still held the power\nWhen the Ethics Committee started investigating Nunes, he recused himself from the Russia probe and picked Conaway to take over.\n\nNunes said he was stepping aside in April, after claiming that \u201cleftwing activist groups\u201d had falsely accused him of leaking classified information. Nunes said it was in the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the investigation to give Conaway control.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans voiced confidence in Conaway as the new face of the investigation. \n\n\u201cLook forward to working on investigation with @ConawayTX11,\u201d the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), tweeted after the announcement. \u201cHe\u2019s great colleague  new role gives investigation fresh  important new start.\u201d\n\nAnd though many Democrats reviled Nunes, Conaway had built up a better reputation.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a nice, likable guy, I get along with him great,\u201d said Mike Quigley (D-IL), a House Intelligence Committee member, in an interview Wednesday. \u201cCertainly in comparison to Nunes.\u201d\n\nBut though he moved into a position of leadership, in practice, Conaway hasn\u2019t been in control of the investigation, according to both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nNunes kept most of the legal authority that the chair of a committee could use, particularly the ability to force a witness to testify through a subpoena.\n\n\u201cWhen witnesses refuse to answer, without Chairman Nunes enforcing a subpoena, we became fairly toothless,\u201d Quigley said.\n\nAnd though Conaway took over the basic operations of the probe, he didn\u2019t really have the authority to see the more difficult decisions through. \u201cI got the impression that he was trying,\u201d Quigley said. \u201cHe was in a tough position.\u201d\n\nNunes himself, after the ethics investigation cleared him, said that he had never really left his position at the helm of the investigation. \u201cI\u2019m in charge,\u201d Nunes told Fox News in December, the day the Ethics Committee cleared him. \u201cI was always in charge.\u201d\n\nNunes\u2019s spokesperson did not immediately respond to my request for clarification of that quote.\n\n\u201cChairman Nunes, even when he said he was stepping aside \u2026 never did, and continued to make all the key decisions,\u201d Schiff, the senior Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with Politico Monday.\n\nBut Conaway is now the public face of the Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation, and his announcement on March 12 closing the House investigation immediately began a bruising fight with Democrats.\n\nConaway said that he\u2019d ended the investigation because the committee had looked into all relevant issues, while a spokesperson for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said that Republicans didn\u2019t want the investigation to interfere with the 2018 election in November.\n\nIn response, Schiff released a 21-page memo, detailing leads and 30 witnesses Democrats say the committee should have interviewed, including White House advisers Stephen Miller and Kellyanne Conway, who have had access to Trump during his time in the White House and might be able to talk about what Trump was thinking when he fired FBI Director James Comey.\n\nConaway then sent a 150-page final report draft to Democrats on March 13, who didn\u2019t work with Conaway in writing any of it, according to the Washington Post. After a week of review including tweaks by Republicans on the committee, the Intelligence Committee is set to meet on Thursday to vote on a final version.\n\nSo in the end, it appears that a Texas lawmaker who was expected to lead a bipartisan investigation produced a report more partisan than anyone expected.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Andrew Prokop", "body": "John Dowd, who has been President Trump\u2019s lead personal lawyer for the Russia investigation since last summer, resigned his position on Thursday, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe news comes after weeks of rumors about an impending shakeup of Trump\u2019s legal team, just as it\u2019s been in the midst of negotiations with Special Counsel Robert Mueller about a sit-down interview with the president. \n\nIt also comes after Trump has escalated his rhetoric criticizing Mueller and his probe. (Dowd has lately done the same, saying last weekend that the Justice Department should now \u201cbring an end to\u201d the \u201calleged Russia Collusion investigation.\u201d)\n\nDowd\u2019s exit is \u201ca largely mutual decision,\u201d coming because Trump had lost confidence in his legal strategy, and because Dowd was frustrated that Trump wanted to bring new attorneys on to the team, the Washington Post\u2019s Rosalind Helderman, Carol Leonnig, and Ashley Parker report. \n\nThe Post team also reports that Dowd \u201cdisagreed vehemently with Trump over a legal strategy\u201d at one point in recent weeks, though it\u2019s not clear what that is. Meanwhile, the New York Times\u2019 Michael Schmidt and Maggie Haberman report that Dowd is leaving because he \u201cconcluded\u201d that Trump \u201cwas increasingly ignoring his advice.\u201d\n\nTrump insisted on Twitter just 11 days ago that he was \u201cVERY happy with my lawyers\u201d and had no plans to shake up the team. But days later, he decided to bring aboard longtime conservative lawyer Joseph diGenova \u2014 who has argued on television that the Justice Department and FBI are trying to frame the president. And this might not be the end of the shakeup, either.\n\nTrump\u2019s legal team, explained\n\n\nThe Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out. Wrong. I am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow. They are doing a great job and.....\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 11, 2018\n\n\n\n\nTo keep the various members of Trump\u2019s legal team for the Mueller investigation straight, you have to keep in mind that some are outside lawyers representing Donald Trump personally, while other are official White House staffers charged with representing the office of the presidency.\n\nThe personal legal team:\n\n\nAfter last May, when Trump fired FBI director James Comey and Mueller was then appointed as special counsel, Trump put outside lawyer Marc Kasowitz in charge of his personal legal defense. But Kasowitz only lasted about two months \u2014 he was pushed out in July, amidst the Trump team\u2019s hapless response to the revelation of Don Jr.\u2019s meeting with a Russian lawyer, and amidst news that Kasowitz had sent profane and threatening emails to a stranger (\u201cWatch your back, bitch\u201d).\nThen, it was John Dowd who Trump anointed as his lead personal lawyer. Dowd had decades work of experience representing defendants accused of white-collar crimes, including in political scandals (and also, famously, investigated baseball player Pete Rose\u2019s gambling scandal for Major League Baseball back in the 1980s). He resigned Thursday.\nTrump\u2019s personal legal team also includes Jay Sekulow, a longtime conservative activist lawyer, who frequently appears on television.\nAnd just days ago, Joseph diGenova, a conservative lawyer had legal roles in high-profile political scandals for decades (and also frequently appears on television), joined Trump\u2019s personal legal team too.\n\nThe White House legal team:\n\n\nInside the White House, meanwhile, Russia- and scandal-related legal matters were first handled by White House Counsel Don McGahn. \nBut last summer, the mustachioed Ty Cobb joined the White House and became its lead lawyer handling Mueller investigation matters \u2014 reportedly at Dowd\u2019s suggestion. (Cobb also became famous for his repeated rosy claims that Mueller\u2019s investigation would soon wrap up \u2014 claims that did not quite pan out.)\n\nIs Trump opting for a more reckless legal strategy \u2014 or is he just looking for better help?\nSince diGenova has been going around claiming the FBI and Justice Department framed Trump, one might be tempted to conclude that his hiring, coupled with the president\u2019s recent rhetoric, means Trump is shifting toward a more confrontational, reckless, and even conspiratorial legal strategy. \n\nHowever, recent reports have also revealed Trump\u2019s interest in hiring two very highly respected mainstream lawyers \u2014 Emmet Flood (who represented President Bill Clinton during the impeachment saga), and Ted Olson (who\u2019s believed to be one of the best Republican litigators around \u2014 but is famous for overturning California\u2019s same-sex marriage ban). Neither hire has panned out, but the interest could indicate that Trump simply thinks he needs better representation than Dowd has been providing.\n\nThat would make sense, since Dowd\u2019s gotten his fair share of criticism. Back in December, Trump sent a tweet in which he said he fired Michael Flynn because he lied to the FBI. After many observed that this was a seeming admission of obstruction of justice \u2014 since if Trump knew Flynn committed a crime, his later request that Comey stop investigating Flynn would be an attempt to cover up a crime \u2014 Dowd said that in fact he had drafted the tweet, and had just mixed up his facts wrong.\n\nA few months before that, Dowd was infamously overheard by a New York Times reporter discussing Trump\u2019s legal strategy with Ty Cobb, the top White House lawyer for the Russia probe, during lunch at a DC steakhouse. (Trump is also rumored to be considering firing Ty Cobb \u2014 something that, considering Cobb has been completely wrong about the Mueller investigation wrapping up quickly, would also make some sense.)\n\nSo it\u2019s not clear whether things are heading right now. It is possible that Trump could bring in a highly qualified and respected top lawyer to replace Dowd. It\u2019s also possible that ... he could go in a different direction. Because one problem is that highly qualified top lawyers don\u2019t seem to have much interest in representing Trump \u2014 CNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz reports that \u201c4 defense attorneys at different large law firms have been approached to join Trump\u2019s legal defense team in recent weeks,\u201d but \u201call 4 turned him down.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "German Lopez", "body": "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has moved to ban bump stocks, devices that effectively let semiautomatic weapons mimic machine guns.\n\nOn Friday, the US Department of Justice filed a regulation that will prohibit the devices \u2014 fulfilling Trump\u2019s request to do so. The regulation would classify these devices as banned \u201cmachineguns\u201d under current federal law. The regulation will now undergo a 90-day period for public comments, after which it could be changed or go into effect as is.\n\nThe measure comes more than a month after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, which killed 17, and on the eve of the gun violence\u2013focused March for Our Lives. But the gunman in the Florida shooting did not use a bump stock \u2014 meaning the ban would have had no impact on the massacre there.\n\nThe bump stock ban originally came up in response to the Las Vegas shooting last year, in which a shooter used the devices to kill 58 others and injure hundreds more. The gunman still may have carried out the shooting without bump stocks, but the devices at least made the shooting much deadlier \u2014 by turning his semiautomatic weapons into guns that closely simulated automatics.\n\nAutomatic weapons are what many Americans think of as machine guns. They can continuously fire off a stream of bullets by simply holding down the trigger \u2014 making them very deadly. Semiautomatic weapons, by contrast, fire a single bullet per trigger pull. The difference between an automatic and a semiautomatic effectively translates to firing hundreds of rounds a minute versus dozens or so in the same time frame.\n\nUnder federal law, fully automatic weapons are technically legal only if made before 1986, when Congress passed the Firearm Owners\u2019 Protection Act. So it\u2019s illegal to manufacture new automatic weapons for civilian use.\n\nBump stocks offer a way around the law, as the Associated Press explained shortly after the Las Vegas shooting:\n\n\nThe device basically replaces the gun\u2019s shoulder rest, with a \u201csupport step\u201d that covers the trigger opening. By holding the pistol grip with one hand and pushing forward on the barrel with the other, the shooter\u2019s finger comes in contact with the trigger. The recoil causes the gun to buck back and forth, \u201cbumping\u201d the trigger.\n\nTechnically, that means the finger is pulling the trigger for each round fired, keeping the weapon a legal semi-automatic.\n\n\nThere are other modifications that achieve a similar effect, including a crank that replaces the trigger and turns a gun into what a gun aficionado channel on YouTube called \u201ca mini Gatling Gun.\u201d\n\nShortly after the Florida shooting, Trump called on the Justice Department to ban bump stocks and similar devices. The Justice Department\u2019s decision to do so comes despite a reluctance \u2014 reported as recently as December \u2014 that the Justice Department or Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) have the legal authority ban bump stocks and similar devices.\n\nThe new regulation, as CNN host Jake Tapper reported, is likely to lead to court challenges.\n\nBut even if it survives, there\u2019s a big question of just how effective this ban will be.\n\nAmerica needs to go much further than a bump stock ban\nThe bump stock ban is among several proposals Trump has made to tighten gun controls after the Florida shooting, such as improving reporting to the background check system and raising the legal age for purchasing assault-style weapons from 18 to 21. Even if all of these efforts are successful, it\u2019s unclear just how much of an effect this would all have \u2014 because they do little to quickly address the core problem behind US gun violence.\n\nThe US is unique in two key \u2014 and related \u2014 ways when it comes to guns: It has way more gun deaths than other developed nations, and it has far more guns than any other country in the world.\n\nThe US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate as Canada, more than seven times as Sweden, and nearly 16 times as Germany, according to UN data compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.)\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Javier Zarracina/Vox\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nMass shootings actually make up a small fraction of America\u2019s gun deaths, constituting less than 2 percent of such deaths in 2013. But America does see a lot of these horrific events: According to CNN, \u201cThe US makes up less than 5% of the world\u2019s population, but holds 31% of global mass shooters.\u201d\n\nThe US also has by far the highest number of privately owned guns in the world. Estimated in 2007, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 88.8 guns per 100 people, meaning there was almost one privately owned gun per American and more than one per American adult. The world\u2019s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 54.8 guns per 100 people.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Max Fisher/Washington Post\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nAnother way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world\u2019s population, yet own roughly 42 percent of all the world\u2019s privately held firearms.\n\nThese two facts \u2014 on gun deaths and firearm ownership \u2014 are related. The research, compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health\u2019s Injury Control Research Center, is pretty clear: After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths.\n\n\u201cWithin the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide,\u201d David Hemenway, the Injury Control Research Center\u2019s director, wrote in Private Guns, Public Health.\n\nFor example, a 2013 study, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, found that, after controlling for multiple variables, a 1 percent increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate at the state level.\n\nThis chart, based on data from researcher Josh Tewksbury, shows the correlation between the number of guns and gun deaths among wealthier nations:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nGuns are not the only contributor to violence. (Other factors include, for example, poverty, urbanization, and alcohol consumption.) But when researchers control for other confounding variables, they have found time and time again that America\u2019s high levels of gun ownership are a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers. \n\nThis is in many ways intuitive: People of every country get into arguments and fights with friends, family, and peers. But in the US, it\u2019s much more likely that someone will get angry at an argument and be able to pull out a gun and kill someone.\n\nGun control measures can help address this by reducing the amount of people who own guns, whether over time or immediately.\n\nThe research supports gun control: A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence \u2014 a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives.\n\nBut not all gun control is made equal. Consider the specifics of the US: If the key problem is that America has too many guns, then it needs to do something to reduce the number of guns in circulation quickly \u2014 something akin to Australia\u2019s response to a mass shooting in the late 1990s, when the country passed sweeping restrictions on firearms and enacted what was effectively a gun confiscation program for certain types of weapons. That policy not only cut the amount of guns in circulation, but, based on the research, may have cut the firearm homicide and suicide rates too.\n\nThe policies Trump has backed wouldn\u2019t achieve that. They could over time reduce the number of guns in circulation \u2014 by imposing barriers that future would-be buyers won\u2019t be able to overcome \u2014 but they don\u2019t do anything to immediately take guns out of circulation. In fact, this is typical in US policy responses to guns: After the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that killed 26, the bill Congress considered (but didn\u2019t pass) would not have implemented even universal background checks, and it certainly wouldn\u2019t have created a mandatory buyback program like Australia\u2019s.\n\nNone of that is to say that milder measures are useless. Connecticut\u2019s law requiring handgun purchasers to first pass a background check and obtain a license, for example, was followed by a 40 percent drop in gun homicides and a 15 percent reduction in gun suicides. Similar results \u2014 in the reverse \u2014 were reported in Missouri when it repealed its own permit-to-purchase law. It\u2019s difficult to separate these changes from long-term trends (especially since gun homicides have generally been on the decline for decades now), but a review of the evidence by RAND linked milder gun control measures, including background checks, to reduced injuries and deaths \u2014 and that means these measures likely saved lives.\n\nBut if America wants to get to the levels of gun deaths that its European peers report, it will likely need to go much further.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Anna North", "body": "Rep.

Lipinski, meanwhile, had served seven terms in Congress, taking over from his father, William Lipinski \u2014 together, the two had served a combined 35 years.\n\nWilliam Lipinski had a major hand in getting his son into Congress in the first place, according to David Bernstein of Chicago magazine, who wrote in 2010 that \u201cafter winning the 2004 primary election William withdrew and then urged Democratic Party leaders to slate Daniel\u2014living in Tennessee at the time\u2014virtually assuring his son\u2019s victory against token Republican opposition.\u201d\n\nDespite Lipinski\u2019s long entrenchment in Chicago politics, Newman was able to make up nearly all of her polling deficit. As of Wednesday morning, Lipinski was ahead 51 percent to 49 percent with 98 percent of districts reporting, according to CNN \u2014 a lead of about 2,124 votes.\n\n\u201cAfter reviewing the results, we know that we lost by a thin margin,\u201d Newman said in a statement conceding the race on Wednesday. \u201cIt was a good fight and I am so proud of the grassroots movement we built.\u201d\n\nNewman had help in her fight, including support from progressive groups like NARAL Pro-Choice America; Emily\u2019s List, which helps elect pro-choice Democratic female candidates to office; and Planned Parenthood. But Lipinski had help too, including a seven-figure investment from the centrist groups No Labels and Country Forward, and a six-figure spend by the anti-abortion organization Susan B. Anthony List, which bought Facebook ads, dispatched canvassers to knock on doors, and sent direct mail asking voters to \u201cimagine someone killing a 7-pound baby for any reason, or no reason at all.\u201d\n\nNewman\u2019s performance could be good news for reproductive rights, and for candidates like her\nMuch of Newman\u2019s campaign focused on painting Lipinski as out of touch with his district on a number of issues, including health care (he voted against the Affordable Care Act), immigration, and reproductive rights. These issues are especially important to Democrats in the wake of Trump\u2019s election, according to research by Jennifer Lawless, director of the Women  Politics Institute at American University. And Newman\u2019s strong performance on Tuesday showed that her approach, while not quite enough to push her over the top, still resonated with Chicago-area voters.\n\nNewman may also have succeeded in pushing Lipinski to the left. \u201cSince we started our campaign, Dan Lipinski has moved his position on health care, a path to citizenship, and the need for a fair minimum wage,\u201d she said in her concession statement. \u201cWe put him on notice that we expect better for all of the people in our district.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the fact that Newman was able to perform so well against an incumbent could be a good sign for the wave of women running for office this year, many of them in tough races. An NPR analysis published on Tuesday cautioned that \u201cthe influx of women candidates, beyond being heavily Democratic, features a glut of Democratic women running in races currently considered to be easy Republican wins.\u201d \n\nSpecifically, 49 percent of Democratic women running for congressional or gubernatorial seats, not including incumbents, are in \u201clikely\u201d or \u201csafe\u201d Republican districts, NPR\u2019s Danielle Kurtzleben wrote.\n\nSome of those women are sure to lose in November (or in their primaries before then). But Newman\u2019s relative success suggests that the right newcomer can motivate voters this year, even against a powerful incumbent. \n\n\u201cThe momentum is with Democratic pro-choice women,\u201d said a spokesperson for Emily\u2019s List, citing historic victories for women in the Virginia state legislature last year, as well as more recent wins at the state and local level. Women first-time candidates endorsed by Emily\u2019s List this election cycle include Gina Ortiz Jones, who would be the first lesbian, first Iraq War veteran, and first Filipina American to hold a House seat in Texas if she wins in the state\u2019s 23rd District in November, according to HuffPost. \n\nAnother is Lauren Underwood, the first African-American woman to run for Congress from Illinois\u2019s 14th District. On Tuesday, she won her primary against six men.\n\nNewman, meanwhile, is focused on the future, pledging to work to unseat Lipinski in 2020. As Erin Vilardi, founder and CEO of VoteRunLead, told NPR, a credible run in one election can help a candidate get more name recognition and party clout for a future run.\n\nWhether or not she decides to run again, her primary race showed that a female first-time candidate running on a progressive platform can mount a serious challenge to a longtime incumbent \u2014 an important lesson for November and beyond.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Dylan Scott", "body": "In a remarkable twist of karma, health care could defeat Republicans at the polls this November.\n\nOpposition to the Affordable Care Act helped sweep the GOP into power eight years ago. But after they spent the last year failing to repeal it while the Trump administration waged a quiet administrative war against the law, Republicans in Congress are facing the very real possibility that health care could animate the backlash that could force them out of power next year.\n\nThat is the subtext of this week\u2019s fight in Congress over whether to include stabilizing the health care law in the government spending bill. Republicans who support stabilization cite reducing premiums as their top priority: Outside experts have projected a 40-percent drop in premiums for ACA plans if stabilization measures were put in place, though estimates from the Congressional Budget Office are not quite as rosy. Those lawmakers haven\u2019t fallen in love with Obamacare or anything, but they see the political utility of lowering premiums.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, know they have a winning issue on their hands. Progressive operatives note that 2019 premiums are supposed to be announced in October \u2014 just a few weeks before the election. Given that last year\u2019s premium increases were rightly attributed to Trump\u2019s sabotage \u2014 and that voters tend to blame the party in power anyway for what is right or wrong with their health care \u2014 that could provide more ammunition for the Democrats in their final attacks right before voters head to the polls.\n\nFrom special elections over the last year, we know health care has been a powerful motivator for Democratic voters. In his razor-thin win in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th congressional district, Democrat Conor Lamb decisively won the health care vote. Polling uniformly shows Americans trust the minority party in Congress over the majority on health care.\n\nRepublicans can\u2019t undo all of the damage of the last year. They have already voted for various unpopular repeal bills that would have left 20 million fewer Americans with health insurance and that would have unwound protections for people with preexisting conditions. \n\nThose attacks are baked in. The GOP\u2019s only remaining hope is to try to mitigate premium increases for next year \u2014 and then hope health care isn\u2019t enough to carry a blue wave.\n\nObamacare stabilization is really about the midterms\nIf you read between the lines, the impetus for Republicans who have spent eight years demonizing Obamacare deciding now to help it is pretty clear: Premiums are going up, they will keep going up without new federal funding, and Americans will blame the people in power if they do.\n\n\u201cRates will go up. The individual market will probably collapse,\u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), who has led the stabilization talks over the last year, said on the Senate floor last week, describing what would happen without a stabilization plan. \u201cThere will be 11 million people who are between jobs, who are self-employed, who are working, who literally cannot afford insurance, and they\u2019re not going to be very happy. And they\u2019re going to blame every one of us, and they should.\u201d\n\nThe polling bears this out, specifically that Republicans will take the blame for the state of Obamacare, even if they hate the law. The Kaiser Family Foundation recently found that 60 percent of Americans believe Republicans are responsible for the ACA going forward. And nothing matters more to voters on health care than its cost.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Kaiser Family Foundation\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nRepublicans already have a mess on their hands of their own making. The Trump administration\u2019s multifaceted crusade against the health care law \u2014 slashing outreach budgets and pulling the law\u2019s cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers \u2014 were already to blame for a 20 percent premium hike this year. Then Congress repealed the individual mandate in their tax bill, a huge political victory given the GOP\u2019s vehement opposition to the mandate but one that insurers have said would drive up premiums even more next year.\n\nThe Republican solution to these problems that they have created is $30 billion in reinsurance funding, proposed by Alexander, Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) and House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Greg Walden (R-OR). They want to pass the funding as part of the government spending bill that must be approved by Friday to avoid a shutdown.\n\nAlexander has clung to evidence that the plan would drive down premiums: 40 percent, according to the consulting firm Oliver Wyman, or a more modest 10 to 20 percent drop, according to the Congressional Budget Office. In either case, the stabilization bill would help avert a round of damning October headlines about skyrocketing insurance costs on the GOP\u2019s watch. (The CBO also projects a slight rise in the uninsured rate because the proposal would end up making insurance more expensive for some people who receive ACA subsidies. But that would not happen immediately.)\n\nIf they can get it passed, that is. House conservatives have always been dubious about stabilizing Obamacare, and now Democrats don\u2019t sound enthused either. \n\nThey might not want to give Republicans a win because of the politics \u2014 like I said, Democratic operatives are keenly aware of when premiums are announced \u2014 but the Trump White House made it easier for them by demanding anti-abortion riders be attached to the plan and by trying to codify an administration proposal that would unwind the ACA\u2019s protections for preexisting conditions.\n\nThat has allowed Democrats to oppose the stabilization bill on solid policy ground, while at the same time denying Republicans a win that would soften the electoral environment for the GOP.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve learned from the special elections\nFrom the Republican perspective, shoring up the insurance markets would at best stop the bleeding. Because the early returns in the midterm elections, and in the public debate over health care, have been brutal for the majority party.\n\nAt the macro level, Americans clearly trust Democrats more than Republicans on the issue. A Politico/Morning Consult poll from November found that 44 percent of voters trusted the Democrats more, compared to 34 percent who trusted Republicans more. (USA Today and Suffolk found a similar breakdown: 43 percent trusted Democrats the most, 15 percent said they trusted Trump, and 10 percent trust Republicans in Congress \u2014 harsh numbers for the GOP any way you cut them.)\n\nOn top of that, the ACA \u2014 the Republican policy boogeyman for the last decade \u2014 has never been more popular than it is today, after withstanding a year of GOP attacks.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Kaiser Family Foundation\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nSo it should come as no surprise that Democrats are already landing substantial wins on health care in this cycle\u2019s special elections thus far.\n\nIt started last summer, with Jon Ossoff\u2019s unexpectedly strong showing to replace Georgia congressman Tom Price. As Jeff Stein documented at the time for Vox, voters in that red district were overwhelming motivated by the health care debate raging on Capitol Hill over a GOP plan projected to increase the ranks of the insured by 20 million or so people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the No. 1 issue,\u201d Ossoff supporter Gopi Nath, 48, told Stein. Three-quarters of voters, even in that red-tinted district, opposed the Republican repeal bill.\n\nA few months later, in Alabama, Doug Jones surged to his shocking upset in another deep-red state by dismissing the GOP\u2019s \u201crepeal and replace\u201d promises as a political slogan and by fiercely advocating for a funding extension for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. \n\nThe most decisive win for Democrats \u2014 and for health care \u2014 was in the Pennsylvania 18th, where Trump won by 20 points just a year ago, a district Republicans had held for 15 years. The Democratic candidate, Lamb, won by less than 1,000 votes, and health care could make a compelling case it put him over the top.\n\nFrom a Public Policy Polling exit poll, taken the day after Pennsylvania\u2019s special election:\n\n\nHealth care was a top issue for 52 percent of voters: 15 percent said it was the most important issue for them and another 37 percent said that it was very important.\nThe health care voters broke hard toward Lamb: 64 percent of those who said it was their No. 1 issue backed the Democrat, and 62 percent of the people who said it was very important supported him.\nObamacare broke even in a district that Donald Trump won by 20 percentage points in 2016: 44 percent of voters supported the law, and 42 percent opposed it.\nMeanwhile, 52 percent of PA-18 voters said they opposed the Republican plans to repeal the health care law, and only 39 percent approved.\n\nThese candidates have settled on a playbook that Democrats should be able to deploy in the most Republican-leaning states and districts across the country: Slam Republicans for trying to take health insurance away from 20 million people and for trying to take away the ACA\u2019s protections for people with preexisting conditions.\n\nTake a look at Wisconsin, a reddening state that should be a battleground in 2018. There, Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin \u2014 up for her first reelection, with constituents feeling either ambivalent or uninformed about her \u2014 has made health care her signature issue. Baldwin had a preexisting condition of her own when she was a child, and she has spent the last few weeks slamming the Trump administration for undermining the ACA.\n\n\u201cHer signature issue right now is health care. Every alternative that the Republicans are offering activates progressives, and the independents are like, \u2018I\u2019m not sure about this one, gang,\u2019\u201d Scot Ross, a progressive activist in the state, told me. \u201cI think that is a feather in Sen. Baldwin\u2019s cap.\u201d\n\nSo a Democratic candidate struggling to build an identity, up for reelection in a state that Republicans have slowly conquered since 2010, turned to health care as her best bet for the fall. There is no better evidence of how health care politics have changed.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Emily Stewart", "body": "Credit reporting agency Equifax in September revealed that a data breach had left the information of 145 million customers exposed. The company waited weeks before disclosing the incident to the public, during which time three executives sold nearly $2 million worth of the company\u2019s shares.\nNot even six months later, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, under interim director Mick Mulvaney, is scaling back an investigation into what happened, according to a new report. It\u2019s the latest example of how the CFPB, which was created under the Obama administration to look out for consumers in the financial products and services  space, is stepping back from that under Trump. \nReuters reported on Monday that Mulvaney, who President Donald Trump in November tapped to temporarily head the CFPB after Director Richard Cordray stepped down, has pulled back from a full-scale probe into how Equifax failed to protect customer data. Sources told the publication that Mulvaney has not ordered subpoenas against Equifax or sought sworn testimony from executives, which it would be expected to do in a full-scale probe. It has put a pause on plans for tests of Equifax\u2019s data protection practices and turned down offers from other federal regulators for help in on-site credit bureau exams. \nTo be sure, the CFPB is not permitted to acknowledge an open investigation, but one was reportedly opened under Cordray. \u201cThe bureau has the desire, expertise, and know-how in-house to vigorously pursue hypothetical matters such as these,\u201d agency spokesman John Czwartacki told Reuters. \nCFPB representatives did not respond to an emailed request for comment from Vox. \nAmericans \u201cdeserve an explanation\u201d from Mulvaney if the Reuters report is indeed true, said Yana Miles, senior legislative counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending, in an emailed statement. \u201cThe public deserves to have a consumer protection watchdog that\u2019s going to keep financial companies and institutions accountable and transparent to the public,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is even more the case with credit bureaus, which have immense power over our financial lives.\u201d\nJust because the CFPB may be scaling back its probe doesn\u2019t mean Equifax will escape scrutiny entirely. As Reuters notes, Equifax has said it is under investigation by every state attorney general and faces more than 240 class action lawsuits. The Federal Trade Commission is examining the breach as well. \nA refresher on the Equifax breach: it was bad\nEquifax in September announced that 143 million of its US-based users \u2014 about half of all of the people in the country \u2014 had their personal information compromised from mid-May through July 2017, including Social Security numbers, birthdates, addresses, and other data. (Equifax later revised up its number of consumers affected to 145.5 million.) The company waited about six weeks between discovering the data breach and publicly announcing it. \nAfter it first announced the data breach, Equifax offered customers affected free credit monitoring and identity protection services \u2014 as long as they agreed to a forced arbitration clause that barred them from joining forces with other wronged customers to sue the company. After a backlash, the company dropped the forced arbitration clause. \nEquifax CEO Richard Smith in late September stepped down. In October, he testified before the Senate Banking Committee and faced questions about Equifax\u2019s handling of consumer data and the breach, executive stock sales, and broader issues pertaining to credit bureaus such as Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian, which handle the personal information of millions of consumers. (Credit bureaus are partly regulated by multiple agencies.) \u201cEquifax and this whole industry should be completely transformed,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said during the hearing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to change this industry before more people are injured.\u201d\nThis is just the latest example of the CFPB\u2019s changing mission\nMulvaney, who is director of the Office of Management and Budget, has been pretty aggressive at the CFPB since President Trump tapped him as interim director in November. He has revised the bureau\u2019s mission statement, adding in a line about \u201cregularly identifying and addressing outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome regulations\u201d and another about \u201cconsistently enforcing\u201d consumer financial law. \nUnder Mulvaney, the bureau hasn\u2019t announced any new enforcement actions. It has announced plans to reconsider a rule that would have imposed restrictions on payday and short-term lenders, such as making sure borrowers would be able to pay them back, and delayed a rule on prepaid cards that increased consumer protections. It dropped an investigation into World Acceptance Corporation, an installment lender that was accused of trying to profit from repeat borrowers. Mulvaney also declined to request any funding for the CFPB this quarter. \n\u201cIn a very few number of days, the acting director has done a great deal of damage,\u201d Aaron Klein, fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution and former Treasury Department aide, recently told me. \u201cWhat seems to be happening at the CFPB is kind of a reflexive, anti-whatever the last guy did approach.\u201d\nBeyond the policy and enforcement measures, some of what Mulvaney has done at the CFPB has been symbolic, and verging on petty. In December, the CFPB renamed a fellowship program for law students and recent graduates that had been named after Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who was known in the early 20th century as the \u201cpeople\u2019s lawyer\u201d for taking on major moneyed interests, including JP Morgan\u2019s railroad monopoly. \nThe fellowship was renamed after Joseph Story, a 19th century Supreme Court justice known for his defense of property rights and economic liberty. Story was a stanch opponent of President Andrew Jackson, of whom Trump is a professed fan, so it\u2019s not clear exactly what Mulvaney was going for in all of this. Carter Dougherty, communications director of Americans for Financial Reform, noted as much on Twitter.\n\n\nTHREAD: Mick Mulvaney @MickMulvaneyOMB has renamed @CFPB legal program to honor a justice who hated President Andrew Jackson, the very same president whom Trump says he reveres. 1/11\u2014 Carter Dougherty (@CarterD) January 2, 2018\n\n\n\nTrump has not yet indicated who he might nominate as permanent director of the CFPB, but in the interim, Mulvaney seems determined to quite a bit of damage. \u201cIt\u2019s discouraging to see that every week Mulvaney is finding new ways to sabotage the consumer bureau,\u201d Miles, from the Center for Responsible Lending, said.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Emily Stewart", "body": "There are perhaps few individuals whose career arcs have been more altered by Donald Trump\u2019s presidency than Preet Bharara. The former US attorney for the Southern District of New York, who was fired by the president last year after refusing to quit, this time last year was Wall Street\u2019s top cop. \nHe is now a leading voice of the opposition, hosting a podcast, offering a voice of reason on the Russia investigation, and, this week, helping launch a new initiative to turn the norms that failed to restrain Trump into laws that would actually rein in his successors. \nIn a USA Today op-ed on Monday, Bharara and former New Jersey Republican Gov. Christine Todd Whitman announced the launch of a democracy task force at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s School of Law. The task force\u2019s purpose is to examine norms on items such as financial conflicts, political interference with law enforcement, and the appointment of public officials, and issue recommendations on policies that \u201ccan be enacted that mend the gaps in our system and ensure we have a government that functions ably, competently and with the trust of the American people.\u201d\nTrump has continually tested the ethical and normative limits, whether by refusing to release his tax returns, remaining entwined in his businesses, or reportedly meddling in the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russia. Office of Government Ethics head Walter Shaub quit his job over the summer to join an outside ethics group after clashing with Trump multiple times on conflicts of interest. \nTrump\u2019s presidency has revealed how many traditions of the presidency are just that \u2014 traditions, not requirements. They\u2019re historical nice-to-haves that assume the president will continue to follow suit. Bharara and Whitman\u2019s task force hopes to give them some teeth. \n\u201cIt\u2019s taking the lessons and transgressions noted on the part of this administration and preventing those things from happening again in the future,\u201d Bharara told me.\nThey face an uphill battle. Congress could pass a law tomorrow requiring the president to release his tax returns or truly divest from his businesses. But so far, Republicans on the Hill have been less than eager to constrain the president.\nStill, Bharara and Whitman are optimistic. I spoke with Bharara about the task force\u2019s goals, his thoughts on the current state of our union, and what he thinks of some of the recent developments at the Justice Department and the FBI. \u201cEverything is on the table so long as it serves the purpose of figuring out which traditions are no longer acceptable on an honor system and need to be enforced,\u201d he said.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nEmily Stewart\nCan you talk a little bit about this initiative you\u2019ve launched \u2014 the democracy task force \u2014 what the idea behind it is, and what you\u2019re hoping to get out of it? \nPreet Bharara\nThe idea is, as we lay out in the op-ed, that there are lots of people of goodwill and good faith on both sides of the political aisle and all across the spectrum. And I think a lot of people \u2014 and I\u2019ve discovered this just from being in the country as a citizen paying attention, but also from interviewing guests on the podcast \u2014 there are a lot of people who believe there are certain things that need to be addressed on a bipartisan basis. \nThere are a lot of people of good faith that think there is some overreaching going on. And a lot of people are naturally focusing on the everyday, what happens today, what happens tomorrow; the news cycle is so rushed and so crazed that it\u2019s almost like people are reacting in the moment, in a frenzy. \nIn conversations with the Brennan Center and with other folks, we thought there should be some focus on the long-term detriment to institutions and all the ways in which the current administration \u2014 and every administration does some version of this \u2014 but the ways in which the current administration is defying all these norms that presents the question: Which of those things should we make sure are codified into hard laws? \nWe don\u2019t consider this to be partisan at all; that\u2019s why there\u2019s a Republican former governor and me. We have [former Republican senator and defense secretary] Chuck Hagel, we have Don Verrilli, who was Obama\u2019s solicitor general, to really sort of think more deeply over a period of time. \nWe\u2019re not on a 24-hour deadline. We want to think long-term about the country, ways that we ensure democracy, and there are a lot of things that are on the table. We haven\u2019t convened and done our work yet, but we\u2019re hoping we can make commonsense proposals that can be implemented in the coming years, some of which, maybe, while this president is in office, and some that can be done later. \nThe example we use in the op-ed is a powerful one. You had two popular presidents, Roosevelt and Kennedy, both of whom did things that the American people decided, \u201cYou know what? That was a bit much. It\u2019s a bit rich to put your own brother in as attorney general.\u201d And I think it\u2019s useful, after every presidency, to think about these things, and that\u2019s sort of the animating principle for this. \nEmily Stewart\nRight, so those examples you cited, FDR staying on for four terms and Congress enacting a two-term limit for presidents; JFK appointing his brother attorney general and Congress passing an anti-nepotism law; all of the laws enacted after Nixon \u2014 that all took place in a different moment. Right now, we have a Congress that is funding the government in three-week increments. Do you feel like this might be out of touch with what\u2019s possible right now?  \nPreet Bharara\nThe point of this is that it\u2019s a long-term effort. We\u2019re not suggesting we\u2019re going to run through the halls of Congress right now and say, \u201cPass this thing we drafted overnight!\u201d In fact, that\u2019s how Congress tends to do things, and it doesn\u2019t turn out well. \nWe\u2019re hoping to have a lot of people who care about the country for different political perspectives, very different political perspectives, think about both what\u2019s good, what\u2019s right, what\u2019s practical, and, my view would be, as one of the co-chairs, what is politically salable to people in the future. \nLook, I don\u2019t know what Congress is going to look like in 12 months when the next session is sworn in. There are members of the task force who probably have one view and I have a different view. But I think the hope is that the more voices there are talking about what kinds of reforms you need and what kinds of laws you might need, people will come on board. \nThe other thing is people are more likely to act with common sense and in the interest of the public if we\u2019re enacting things \u2014 and not everyone will love what I\u2019m about to say \u2014 if we\u2019re enacting things for the future that will affect the next president, whether it\u2019s a Democrat or a Republican. Some things are impossible to pass because you have political allies of the current administration who don\u2019t want to hamper the current administration. We\u2019re saying there may be things that we need to do to curtail overreaching on the part of the current president. \nMore importantly, I think, we\u2019re talking about the long-term, not just about Donald Trump but about any future president, Democrat or Republican. And I think a lot of people might get on board \u2014 not knowing who the eventual nominee or president will be in the future \u2014 on an idea, for example, for there to be a requirement, not just a tradition, that people who run for president disclose their tax returns. \nThe next time around, it could be a deeply conflicted, rich Democrat running for president who says, \u201cHey, screw it, Donald Trump didn\u2019t have to do it, I\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d I don\u2019t think Republicans who are currently allies of Donald Trump, because there\u2019s a lot of hypocrisy here we\u2019re looking to cut through, would like that either. So that\u2019s just an example of the kind of thing I think, over time, could be a proposal that carries some weight.\nEmily Stewart\nSo this is really a longer-term play.\nPreet Bharara\nI mean, we\u2019re not talking about glaciers. But we\u2019re not talking about the 24-hour news cycle. Maybe there are things that we\u2019ll propose in the coming months that can be acted upon quickly, but the thrust of this is to have some time to think deeply and wisely about these issues and develop consensus over time. \nEmily Stewart\nIs your focus only on the presidency, or are you also planning to look at other areas of government \u2014 say, Congress? For example, you have House Republicans voting to release that secret memo put together by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA).\nPreet Bharara\nThe heart of this and what spurred it is a look at the executive branch. As Gov. Whitman pointed out on television, yeah, everything\u2019s open. When we\u2019re fully constituted and meeting and talking about it, I think everything is on the table so long as it serves the purpose of figuring out which traditions are no longer acceptable on an honor system and need to be enforced, and that includes regular order in Congress, I suppose. I think that\u2019s an important part of it; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the central part of it. What we\u2019re talking about more is the executive branch, but other branches are open to discussions, scrutiny, and reform as well. \nEmily Stewart\nSo if you were to boil this down, this is looking for lessons learned from the Trump presidency and how to put that into law.\nPreet Bharara\nYeah, the way I always put it \u2014 which is a very nerdy way of saying it \u2014 is which soft norms should be enacted into hard laws. And yeah, it\u2019s taking the lessons and transgressions noted on the part of this administration and preventing those things from happening again in the future.\nEmily Stewart\nTo shift gears a little bit, what are your thoughts on FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe\u2019s exit? The situation, obviously, isn\u2019t entirely similar to yours, but as another Justice Department official [who was] pushed out, what\u2019s your take on it? \nPreet Bharara\nI don\u2019t know all the facts or the details. There was a report that suggested that [FBI Director] Christopher Wray threatened to resign rather than remove McCabe, and then it looks like it removed McCabe, so I don\u2019t know if there was a change in circumstances. \nWhat I do know is, my personal interactions with Andy McCabe tell me that he is a good and honorable person. I worked cases with him as a junior prosecutor, a line prosecutor, out of the Southern District of New York 15 years ago on the Russian organized crime squad. I know him to be a good, upright, and honorable person, and I don\u2019t like or enjoy the character assassination I see of him and other people. \nEmily Stewart\nSo last week we had this report that President Trump tried to order the firing of special counsel Robert Mueller last summer, and over the weekend, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said Trump firing Mueller would be the end of his presidency. What do you think would happen if he did?\nPreet Bharara\nLindsey Graham says a lot of things that he changes his mind on, because he\u2019s a politician, like a lot of politicians. And I like Lindsey Graham, but he\u2019s a little bit of a weathervane himself.\nWhat would happen? I don\u2019t know. It would be very bad for the country. A lot of people are on record saying that they would take it very seriously, but that remains to be seen. It\u2019s a real concern and fear that people should have. \nEmily Stewart\nFor just an everyday person looking at the Russia investigation and the Mueller investigation right now, what should they be looking out for to have a sense of the direction it\u2019s going in?\nPreet Bharara\nMy view is, which reporters don\u2019t like, watch and see what the public actions of Bob Mueller are. Nothing speaks more loudly than his announcements of charges, indictments, and guilty pleas, and everything else is speculation. \nA lot of these news reports are correct, and a lot of them are not fully correct, and sometimes the devil is in the details. Sometimes, when there are reports that someone in the White House told someone else to do something, it may be more nefarious than is being reported, based on the limited sources that people have, or it may be less nefarious. I\u2019d like to see the results of the actual investigators with subpoena power and grand jury power and see what they come up with.\nEmily Stewart \nAnd finally, in light of Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, how would you characterize the state of the union right now?\nPreet Bharara\nIn peril. In peril.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Emily Stewart", "body": "According to state-run exit polls and early returns, Vladimir Putin has won another term as Russia\u2019s president. He faced no genuine opposition during his presidential campaign, and used all of the tools of his government\u2019s well-oiled propaganda machine to ensure he received a huge percentage of the vote.\n\nPutin\u2019s win, which cements him as one of the most powerful leaders in modern Russian history, means he will remain in office until at least 2024. He has spent years using brute force to reestablish Russia\u2019s prominence as a world power, and his aggressive approach included invading and annexing part of eastern Ukraine, and helping Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad retain his hold on power despite years of brutal fighting. \n\nPutin has also benefitted from the election of Donald Trump, who is arguably the most pro-Russian US president in modern history. The American intelligence community unanimously believes that Moscow interfered in the 2016 election to sway its result towards Trump, but the president has both angrily dismissed those assertions and shied away from seriously punishing Russia for its meddling. Trump has not yet weighed in on Sunday\u2019s election.\n\nStill, there are some signs that President Trump may finally be willing to confront Putin for at least some of his misdeeds. On Thursday, March 15, Trump joined the UK and other European allies in accusing Moscow of using a deadly nerve agent to poison a former Russian spy and his daughter not far from their home in the British town of Salisbury. \n\nThat same day, the US Treasury Department announced long-awaited sanctions to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential elections. The measures targeted more than 20 Russian individuals and organizations, including the Internet Research Agency, a Kremlin-linked troll farm that sought to interfere in the election, and Yevgeny Prigozhin, known as \u201cPutin\u2019s chef,\u201d for his role in bankrolling Russian hackers.\n\nThis means that Putin\u2019s latest victory may not be as sweeping as the numbers would suggest. Putin won at the ballot box, but whether he\u2019ll keep winning in his confrontations with the US, the UK, and other Western countries remains to be seen.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly surprising that Putin won\nHeading into Sunday\u2019s election, there was little doubt that Putin would win \u2014 the question was, largely, by how much. \n\nAccording to a nationwide exit poll conducted by All-Russia Opinion Research Center (VTsIOM), a state-run entity, Putin won 73.9 percent of Sunday\u2019s presidential vote, beating out seven other candidates.\n\nHis nearest challenger, Communist Party candidate Pavel Grudinin, received 11.2 percent of the vote, and ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky had 6.7 percent. The Central Elections Commission said Putin had won about 72 percent of the vote with 22 percent of the country\u2019s precincts reporting. In 2012, Putin received just under 65 percent of the vote. \n\nAccording to the Associated Press, there were widespread reports of ballot-box stuffing and forced voting on Sunday, and Putin was trying to win by a large margin to ensure his mandate to govern is indisputable. His most visible opponent \u2014 anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny \u2014 wasn\u2019t even on the ballot. He was barred from running because he was convicted of fraud in a case that was widely considered to be politically motivated.\n\nAhead of the election, voter turnout was considered to be the main signifier of Putin\u2019s hold on Russia. Independent surveys show that most Russians approve of Putin as president, which might have kept people home as they may have assumed the results were already decided. \n\nThe Kremlin was also reportedly aiming to surpass 2012\u2019s 65 percent turnout level. At 6 pm Moscow time on Sunday, Russia\u2019s Central Election Commission said nationwide turnout was slightly above the level it reached during the 2012 election at that time. \n\nAfter casting his ballot in Moscow on Sunday, Putin said he sought a level of turnout that \u201cgives me the right to perform the duty of president,\u201d according to the New York Times. \u201cI am sure I am offering the right program to the country.\u201d \n\nIt is also worth noting that the 2012 Russian election arguably laid the groundwork for Putin\u2019s election meddling in the American presidential election in 2016. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton raised questions about the legitimacy of 2012\u2019s Russian vote, which Putin took personally and has never forgiven. US intelligence agencies believe that may be why he tried to ensure she lost in 2016.\n\nPutin is facing more pushback on the global stage \nPutin\u2019s Sunday victory may give him even more power in Russia, but he is facing increasing pressure from the international community due to a recent nerve agent attack in the UK and Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nOn March 4, Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury, England. It turned out they had been poisoned with a highly toxic nerve agent.\n\nEight days later, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that Russia was behind the attack on the Skripals. When asked about the event later that day, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to directly blame Russia but said that \u201cwe offer the fullest condemnation\u201d of the attack.\n\nBut on Thursday, the White House issued a joint statement with allies to support Britain\u2019s claim, which said: \u201cThe United Kingdom thoroughly briefed its allies that it was highly likely that Russia was responsible for the attack. We share the United Kingdom\u2019s assessment that there is no plausible alternative explanation.\u201d\n\nMoscow, however, denies it had any hand in the attack but has said it will cooperate with a British investigation if it receives samples of the nerve agent believed to have been used. \n\nThe sanctions that the US Treasury Department issued on Thursday have a bit more of a backstory. In January 2017, the US intelligence community assessed that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election, helping Trump win the White House. Last August, Trump reluctantly signed into law the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), which was designed to make old sanctions against Russia permanent, and to pressure Trump to impose new ones. \n\nThe legislation forced Trump to impose costs on Putin for interfering in America\u2019s democratic process and for his interventions in Ukraine and Syria. Republican and Democratic lawmakers crafted the bill in response to Trump\u2019s unusual warmth toward Russian President Vladimir Putin and his refusal to blame Russia for election interference; it passed both chambers almost unanimously \u2014 98-2 in the Senate and 419-3 in the House \u2014 and it was clear that Congress would override a presidential veto. \n\nBut Trump resented Congress\u2019s move to box him in on Russia policy. The president slammed the legislation in a signing statement, calling it \u201cseriously flawed,\u201d and said that he could \u201cmake far better deals with foreign countries than Congress.\u201d CAATSA was intended to force Trump to impose sanctions in late January \u2014 but he missed the deadline. Instead, the administration released a list of 210 Russian leaders and billionaires with purported ties to Putin in order to show that the administration was watching them.\n\nThen, on March 6, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats announced that new sanctions on Russia were imminent. Mnuchin added that Trump was \u201cfully supportive of the work we\u2019re doing.\u201d On Thursday, March 15, the measures were finally announced. Senior administration officials told reporters that the sanctions were meant to punish Russia for interfering in the 2016 election and for masterminding a global cyberattack, known as NotPetya, that hit large corporations and hospitals in the US and Europe last summer.\n\n\u201cThe administration is, arguably for the first time, directly acknowledging and responding to Russia\u2019s intervention in the 2016 campaign,\u201d said Sean Kane, a former sanctions official at the Treasury Department.\n\nThe new measures target five Russian organizations and 19 Russian individuals. The big organizational targets include two Russian intelligence agencies, known by their acronyms FSB and GRU, and prominent individuals like Prigozhin. That means people connected to the intelligence agencies, and Prigozhin himself, cannot travel to America or do business with American companies, and will soon see their US assets frozen. Experts also say the timing of the sanctions was surely meant to show support for London and condemn Moscow after the nerve agent attack.\n\nThe question remains, though \u2014 does this mean Trump\u2019s attitude toward Russia has changed? Well, it\u2019s complicated.\n\nIs Trump tough on Russia now?\nDespite the sanctions, Trump continues to minimize the extent of Russia\u2019s involvement in his election. He thinks Russia didn\u2019t interfere \u2014 and that Democrats use the Trump-Russia narrative as an excuse for losing the election. Trump has famously called the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russia a \u201cWITCH HUNT!\u201d\n\nEven Trump\u2019s own national security team said he could be tougher on Russia. On February 13, Coats, the intelligence director, told the Senate Intelligence Committee that Russia would continue to interfere in American elections, saying, \u201cFrankly, the United States is under attack.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later, on February 27, Adm. Michael Rogers, who leads US Cyber Command, said during a congressional hearing that Trump had yet to ask him to take measures against Russia\u2019s hackers. \u201cIf we don\u2019t change the dynamic here, this is going to continue, and 2016 won\u2019t be viewed as something isolated,\u201d Rogers told the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cThis is something that will be sustained over time.\u201d\n\nOther military leaders have echoed the admiral\u2019s sentiment, including Army Lt. Gen. Paul Nakasone, Trump\u2019s nominee to replace Rogers after he retires this spring. \u201cI would say right now they do not think much will happen to them,\u201d he said of Russia during one of his confirmation hearings on Thursday, March 1. \u201cThey don\u2019t fear us.\u201d\n\nThat, in part, is why experts seem skeptical that Trump will suddenly become a Russia hawk. Trump has \u201ca reluctance ... to speak clearly about the threat Russia poses to the United States and our allies,\u201d Evelyn Farkas, formerly the Pentagon\u2019s top Russia official, said in an interview. \n\nAnd lawmakers, many of whom are usually critical of the president, feel he could do more to punish Russia. California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement on Thursday that if the president believes Thursday\u2019s action \u201csufficiently addresses the sanctions package Congress sent to respond forcefully to Moscow\u2019s election interference, then he is sorely mistaken.\u201d\n\nTrump likes to boast that he\u2019s much tougher on Russia than his predecessor Barack Obama. But this past week is the first time he really did anything to back up that claim. \u201cBy no means will this constitute the end to our ongoing campaign to instruct Mr. Putin to change his behavior,\u201d a senior administration official told reporters on Thursday morning.\n\nThe US president has yet to weigh in on the latest Russian election results, and it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how he\u2019ll respond.

This is in part due to fundamentals that favor the party out of power in midterm elections, but President Trump\u2019s unpopularity has also given Democrats across the country something to rally around. And special elections have been very good for Democrats so far; they have swept a number of state races in red districts in Virginia, Wisconsin, and Kentucky, plus the Senate race in Alabama.\n\nLamb rarely mentions Trump in his campaign speeches. But his candidacy is an important post-2016 test of whether the party can successfully run moderate candidates in deeply red Rust Belt districts that swung for the president two years ago.\n\nEven if Lamb loses in March, he\u2019ll have another opportunity to compete again in the fall in an 18th District that looks different (and more favorable to Democrats), given the new congressional map drawn up by Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court.

Job declines in the US coal industry will likely continue, Obama regulations are not responsible for its ills, and nothing the federal government can do, short of declaring martial law and forbidding the closure of coal-fired power plants, can save it. \nTrump exploited coal\u2019s cultural resonance in his campaign\nCoal has always had strong cultural resonance in the US. \n\nIn his campaign, Trump seized on that resonance with an odd kind of fervor, using miners as props in political rallies and promising, again and again, to put them back to work. He has managed to make the fate of coal miners a synecdoche for the fate of the white working class writ large.\nWhat\u2019s distasteful is that Trump has won the allegiance of coal communities by reinforcing and amplifying the lie they have been told by right-wing media and politicians for years: that Obama is responsible for the coal industry\u2019s (and their) recent woes. \nIt\u2019s not true. Easily available information shows its not true. But it is a convenient lie, one that riles up a reliable political constituency and serves as a bludgeon in the culture war. \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nIt is not, however, a benign lie. The struggles facing Appalachian coal country are very real. Unemployment, ill health, drug addiction, stress, and depression have ravaged the region. Now thousands of retired coal miners are in danger of losing their pensions and health care benefits. \n(Guess who has refused to schedule a vote on a bill that would address that crisis? One Addison Mitchell McConnell, Republican leader of the Senate. Guess who had a plan to funnel $30 billion to suffering Appalachian communities? One Hillary Rodham Clinton, the competent, boring president America might have had, if not for her emails.) \nIt does people in the region no good to believe that coal jobs will come roaring back once pesky pollution regulations are overturned. It sets them up for more disappointment and wastes time and energy they could be devoting to finding a new and better future for their communities. \nSo let\u2019s put this story to rest once and for all, with numbers. Let\u2019s look at what has happened to US coal, its future prospects, and what Trump can and can\u2019t do for it. \nHelpfully, the Columbia Center on Global Energy Policy released a superb report on this subject back in April 2016, authored by Trevor Houser, Jason Bordoff, and Peter Marsters. It is a close empirical analysis of coal\u2019s history, what has happened to it recently, and what is responsible. Also: great graphs. It\u2019s really worth reading if you have 50 pages\u2019 worth of curiosity about this stuff, but if you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll cover the highlights.\nCoal\u2019s recent decline has been rapid and brutal\nLet\u2019s start with the facts to be explained.\nIn 2011, US coal was riding high, recovering from the recession and planning enormous expansion. Then between 2011 and 2016, it absolutely cratered. US coal production dropped by 27 percent. Domestic demand fell 30 percent. Demand for exports dried up. \nThe combined market value of the country\u2019s four big coal companies dropped from $33 billion to $150 million (yes, you read that right). Three of the four declared bankruptcy, in the process shedding hundreds of millions in retiree pension and health care obligations. Some 120,000 retired miners and dependents are now at risk of losing what they have left.\nAnd more than 58,000 coal miners and contractors lost their jobs, the latest chapter in the long decline in US coal mining employment.\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        (CGEP)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nNationally, the loss of 58,000 jobs is not a big deal. (The US economy creates more than 100,000 jobs a month.) But the losses were highly concentrated in mining communities. In Mingo County, West Virginia, for example, overall employment fell from 8,513 to 4,878. Imagine: Half the people in your community lose their jobs in the space of five years, in what is effectively the only local industry.\nIt left coal communities devastated and desperate.\nExactly what has waged war on coal, and how much\nSo what\u2019s responsible for this wreckage? Houser et al. set out to put some numbers on it. \nThey did so by comparing coal\u2019s actual performance with 2006 Energy Information Administration projections, corrected for the decline in overall demand (which the EIA, like everyone else, completely failed to anticipate). Then they did the same for natural gas and renewables. Finally, they \u201cexplored how each fuel\u2019s share of total interconnect-level generation varied in 2016 from what the EIA had projected.\u201d \nComparing projections with actual performance, they were able to quantify how much of coal\u2019s projected market share was eaten up by competitors (and other forces). Here are the culprits, the leading brigades in the \u201cwar on coal,\u201d listed by size:\n\nNatural gas: 49 percent\nLower-than-expected demand: 26 percent\nRenewable energy: 18 percent\nObama regulations: 3 to 5 percent\n\nThe impact of regulations was calculated somewhat differently, based on the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s projected costs, which historically have tended to be much lower than industry\u2019s projections but much higher than actual after-the-fact costs. And the researchers modeled what would happen if Obama\u2019s most significant regulations simply vanished. In reality, they won\u2019t vanish; they will probably just be weakened after months or years of rulemaking and legal challenge. \nSo 5 percent should be considered an unrealistically high upper bound for the impact of Obama\u2019s regs. (There\u2019s much discussion of methodological challenges in the report.)\nWhat\u2019s clear is that the \u201cwar on coal\u201d was led by cheap, fracked natural gas. Renewables and efficiency played vital supporting roles. Obama\u2019s regulations were, in comparison, a peashooter. \nThe secret weapon in the war on coal: collapsing Chinese demand\nMost discussion of declining demand for US coal focuses on the US electricity sector (which is responsible for 93 percent of domestic coal consumption), specifically the twin booms in natural gas and renewables. And those are indeed significant (if oft-told) stories. \nBut the most important \u2014 and most overlooked \u2014 story on coal demand is international.\nI wrote a longer post on the subject here, but the TL;DR version is: In the first decade of the 21st century, Chinese demand for coal went through the roof. \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        (CEGP)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nFor a while, China was able to keep up with demand with domestic coal. But eventually its internal supply lines grew strained, and it started importing more, increasing the price of coal on international markets \u2014 particularly metallurgical coal, which is used to make steel (and which Appalachia provides). US exports boomed.\n\u201cWhile only 12 percent of this growth was actually shipped to China,\u201d Houser et al. write, \u201cit was China-driven growth in global coal prices that made US exports to closer markets in Europe and Latin America commercially viable.\u201d\nIt was exports that were driving the US coal boom in 2011 \u2014 and it was exports that account for more than half the decline in demand through 2016.\nChina\u2019s demand for coal plateaued and recently began declining. Even if it rallies a little here and there (as it did this year), it is never going back to gangbusters growth. (And no, as the report discusses at length, growth in India won\u2019t be enough to make up the difference.)\nCoal executives did not see the China pivot coming. At all. They made huge bets on the premise that Chinese demand would grow forever. They screwed themselves. \nWell, actually, they\u2019ll be fine \u2014 they\u2019re even getting bonuses! (Seriously.) They screwed their workers, the landscapes they operate in, and, as it turned out, US politics. \nTrump\u2019s blustery regulatory rollback can\u2019t do much for coal\nTo find out what Trump could possibly do for US coal demand, the researchers modeled scenarios in which the following Obama rules were simply canceled:\n\nEPA\u2019s CO2 standards for new power plants\nEPA\u2019s CO2 standards for existing power plants (the \u201cClean Power Plan\u201d)\nEPA\u2019s methane regulations for new oil and gas production\nThe Bureau of Land Management\u2019s methane regulations for both new and existing oil and gas production on federal lands\nThe Department of Interior\u2019s coal leasing moratorium on federal lands \n\nAs I said \u2014 and Brad Plumer described in detail \u2014 permanently getting rid of those rules will be enormously difficult in practice. It will take years, and the result won\u2019t be no rules but, at best, weakened rules. So this is a theoretical upper bound on what Trump can accomplish with his attack on Obama\u2019s rules.\nThere\u2019s tons of interesting discussion in the report, but it\u2019s all captured in this graph:\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        (CEGP)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThis shows historical US coal consumption and projections of coal consumption in the face of Obama\u2019s rules (or their absence). Those are the red and blue lines.\nBut note: The red Trump line is the central projection, based on the EIA\u2019s projections of the price of natural gas and renewables. The EIA could well be \u2014 and usually has been \u2014 wrong about how prices will evolve. There\u2019s enormous uncertainty.\nSo the shaded red area shows the range of Trump projections, based on scenarios in which natural gas and renewables turn out cheaper (or more expensive) than the EIA expects.\nThe most notable feature of this result is that the range of uncertainty around the Trump scenario is greater than the difference between the Trump scenario and the Obama scenario. In other words, over coming decades, market trends promise to be more consequential for US coal consumption than all Obama\u2019s rules combined. \nAnd it\u2019s worth remembering that natural gas and renewables have both tended to prove cheaper than EIA projections. Here, for instance, are recent natural gas prices compared with forecasts (\u201cAEO\u201d stands for the EIA\u2019s Annual Energy Outlook):\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        (CEGP)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nProjections keep showing prices plateauing or rising; real prices keep falling. The same is true for EIA projections on solar and wind.\nIf EIA is still underestimating natural gas and renewables \u2014 as seems likely \u2014 then it is entirely possible that US coal consumption could decline so much that it completely swamps the effect of Trump\u2019s executive order. Just as market developments were primarily responsible for coal\u2019s decline, it is market developments that will primarily determine its future. Trump, like Obama, is wielding a peashooter. \nAt the very best, Trump\u2019s regulatory assault, if it is coupled with unexpectedly high natural gas and renewable energy prices, could boost US coal consumption back up to 2015 levels. \n\u201cThe problem,\u201d Plumer wrote in a previous post on this, \u201cis that in 2015, mining employment was still at near-historically low levels. There were only about 63,000 miners in America that year \u2014 somewhat higher than today\u2019s levels of 50,000 \u2014 but still lower than at any point since the 1980s.\u201d\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Sad!\n      \n      \n        (CEGP)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nIn reality, Trump\u2019s regulatory assault is likely to have as many failures as successes. Natural gas prices, renewable energy prices, and overall demand are likely to be beneath projections (again). US coal consumption and coal mining jobs are likely to continue declining. The market\u2019s war on coal will continue.\nThat is a far cry from Trump\u2019s promises to coal miners.\n\n\n\"Basically, you know what this is?\" Trump says to miners as he signs exec order. \"You know what it says, right? You\u2019re going back to work.\"\u2014 Juliet Eilperin (@eilperin) March 28, 2017\n\n\n\nWhat coal mining communities actually need to rebound\nThe report concludes with a short discussion of the kinds of things that might actually help suffering coal mining communities. It touches on a few of the local efforts underway and notes that the federal government can help:\nThere is a lot the federal government can do to help accelerate locally driven economic diversification efforts. Infrastructure investment, tax credits, and repurposing of abandoned mine land that has other economic use can attract new investment and job creation. Expanded broadband access is particularly important as it can overcome the geographic barriers that limit coal communities\u2019 physical access to both suppliers and markets and enable new types of economic activity. Competitive grants can help get nascent economic diversification initiatives off the ground. And the federal government can help provide retirement and healthcare security by passing the Miners\u2019 Protection Act.\n(More on the Miners Protection Act \u2014 sponsored by West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and a bipartisan list of 25 other senators \u2014 here.)\nTrump\u2019s budget proposed to slash funding for many of the existing federal programs that help Appalachia, most notably the Appalachian Regional Commission and the Economic Development Administration. Those are just a few of the cuts he favored that would hurt coal communities and workers. Spending has to be cut, after all, to make way for Congress\u2019s enormous tax cut for corporations and the wealthy.\nAnd thus far, Trump has been publicly silent about the threat to miner pensions, though he\u2019s assured Manchin in private that he intends to speak up about it, and he usually keeps his promises, so that\u2019s all good.\nThe GOP\u2019s loyalty to coal communities seems to extend exactly as far as rolling back pollution regulations, and no further. Coincidentally, rolling back pollution regulations also enriches fossil fuel executives (and disproportionately impacts the health of working-class families). Certainly helping coal communities is never prioritized over, say, high-end tax cuts. At least miners get to appear as props in political rallies, though.\nAnd all the while, Trump just keeps lying to them. The whole GOP does. More than a few Democrats, too.\nWhatever solutions might benefit coal communities, surely it must begin with telling them the truth: US coal is not coming back. Coal jobs are not coming back. Imposing more pollution on already-suffering communities won\u2019t change that.\n\nThe only way forward is through investment in regional economic diversification and development. It will be a hard road \u2014 new industries and opportunities will not grow as fast as coal fell \u2014 but it is the only road. Waiting for coal to come back is about as fruitful as waiting for the South to rise again.\nIt\u2019s time for these communities to hear the truth from those they trust. And if they don\u2019t, it might be time for them to start trusting different people.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Dylan Scott", "body": "One year into Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, on the eve of his first State of the Union address, he has more or less abandoned his outspoken pledges to bring down the cost of America\u2019s medicines, the highest in the world.\n\u201cDespite continuing rhetoric that the pharmaceutical companies are getting away with murder,\u201d said Rachel Sachs, a Washington University in St. Louis professor who follows drug pricing, \u201che has done absolutely nothing on this issue, and that has actually surprised me.\u201d\nTrump was unorthodox about drug prices during the 2016 campaign. He swore to stand up to the pharmaceutical companies, long revered as among Washington\u2019s powerful interests. He told Time, in his Person of the Year interview in December 2016: \u201cI\u2019m going to bring down drug prices. I don\u2019t like what has happened with drug prices.\u201d\nUnder Trump, drug companies have undertaken a concerted campaign to shift the discussion about drug prices to a conversation about out-of-pocket costs, in which health insurers and pharmacy benefits managers are under the microscope. \nThe companies\u2019 campaign appears to have borne fruit, judging by regulatory changes being pursued by the Trump administration on Medicare. Trump has also filled the executive branch with officials closely tied to the drug industry; his new pick to lead Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, was most recently a top executive at Eli Lilly. \nAs Azar was sworn into office Monday, Trump promised again that he would bring prescription drug prices \u201cway down.\u201d But experts say that in first year of Trump\u2019s presidency the drug industry has gained the upper hand in the lobbying campaign against its foes in the health care industry.\n\u201cI think they think they had a good year. They dodged a bullet,\u201d Len Nichols, a health policy professor at George Mason University, told me. \u201cI think of the pharmaceutical pricing issue as somewhat of a titanic struggle between pharma and the plans. If you think of it that way, in the Trump administration, pharma won Round 1.\u201d\nTrump promised repeatedly during the campaign he would bring down drug prices\nTrump was in many ways unlike any candidate \u2014 particularly any Republican \u2014 who came before him. Exhibit A: his promise to bring down drug prices. Back in January 2016, he was arguing that Medicare should be directly negotiating the prices it pays for medications and blaming the lobbying power of the drug companies for preventing it.\nIt was a position far closer to that of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), an avowed democratic socialist, than a more conventional Republican like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. But Trump was on firm populist ground. Fresh off the outrage over \u201cpharma bro\u201d Martin Shkreli, alleged price-gouging by his former company Valeant Pharmaceuticals, and groundbreaking but costly hepatitis C drugs, the public had named drug prices as their No. 1 priority for American health care in late 2015.\nThat furor hasn\u2019t faded much in the intervening months. Last spring, the Kaiser Family Foundation again found drug costs right near the top of the public\u2019s priorities.\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Kaiser Family Foundation\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nTrump viscerally tapped into that anger, and he stuck with the issue throughout the 2016 campaign. Advocating for a big-government approach to lowering drug costs put him at odds with the Republican Party but in line with what Americans say they want.\nHe wasn\u2019t afraid to use the most vivid rhetoric at his disposal to describe the ills of the pharmaceutical industry.\n\u201cThey\u2019re getting away with murder,\u201d Trump told reporters in January 2017, picking up on the exact language Sanders had used during the Democratic primary. \u201cPharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power.\u201d\nCandidate Trump was onto something very real: Americans do spend more per person on drugs than any other country in the world. As health insurance plans shift to higher out-of-pocket costs for their customers, people feel more and more of that burden.\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Sarah Kliff/Vox\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nHopes were high among the advocates working to lower drug prices. The industry was skittish. The stage was set for a showdown.\nDrug prices haven\u2019t been a priority for Trump\u2019s White House\nBut a big fight over drug prices never materialized. Instead, the Trump administration has been successfully courted in many ways by the pharmaceutical industry.\nThe industry was already launching its bold counteroffensive in the pricing debate: Three days after Trump was sworn into office, the trade association PhRMA announced a new advertising campaign to rebrand drug makers as leaders in medical innovation. \nThe campaign would have happened no matter who was in the White House, and PhRMA\u2019s new president, Steve Ubl, has marshaled a new strategy at the group, seeking to more directly engage in the debate, industry officials say. The industry association took steps to rid itself of some bad actors too. There was, to some extent, a legitimate response to the shifting public discourse about drug prices.\nBut there was no guaranteeing what kind of audience pharma would find in President Trump, given what he had said before he took office. During his first month in office, several top pharma executives met with the new president at the White House.\nComing out of that meeting, Trump was using language that sounded much more familiar \u2014 and much more comfortable \u2014 to drug companies. He was talking about increasing competition and lightening the regulatory burden to get drugs approved. \n\u201cThere has been an education of Mr. Trump,\u201d one top industry insider told me. \u201cTo where the real costs are, to the impact of other players in the system, and to the cost benefits of medicine in the system.\u201d\n\u201cIt was important,\u201d this person said of the White House meeting. \u201cThe CEOs showed respect to the president. They came, they sat around the table, they were chastened by his comments. ... It began a pathway of sincere dialogue. \u2018Okay, you wanna talk? Let\u2019s talk.\u2019\u201d\n(Another sign of the times: When Trump rubbed shoulders with the global elite in Davos, Switzerland, last week, two top drug executives got a seat at the White House\u2019s private dinner.)\nTrump\u2019s campaign pledge to have Medicare directly negotiate drug prices never seriously resurfaced after that meeting. A promised executive order on drug prices never materialized; Politico reported in June that a list of the possible policy changes that had been pulled together \u201cinclude[d] policies that read like gifts to the drug industry.\u201d\nTrump selected an industry-favored nominee to lead the Food and Drug Administration, Scott Gottlieb. After his first health secretary was forced to step down amid a scandal over charter jet travel, the president turned to Azar, who oversaw drug pricing at Eli Lilly for years, to lead the agency. \nWhile Gottlieb has earned praise for the work he has done at the FDA to increase competition, and Azar will enter HHS having pledged to do more on drug prices, they are nonetheless far afield from Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric. They have never signed on to the policies that Trump pushed as a candidate. \nAzar took a far more nuanced tone than his boss in his Senate confirmation hearing, noting that private Medicare Part D plans already do negotiate prices themselves, while cracking open the door \u2014 but hardly rushing through it \u2014 for tweaking other parts of Medicare to address drug costs.\n\u201cWhen populism meets reality, reality usually wins,\u201d Kim Monk, who tracks health policy for investors at Capital Alpha, told me. \u201cThe folks he\u2019s brought in tend to be free market folks, industry folks who don\u2019t like the government negotiating drug prices because they don\u2019t believe it would work.\u201d\nThe discussion about drug \u201cprices\u201d isn\u2019t about prices anymore\nTrump\u2019s promises coming into office were unambiguous: He wanted to bring down drug prices, and he planned to confront the pharmaceutical industry directly. But a year later, the discussion about drug prices has shifted to something else. \nThe spotlight has been turned on health plans, for structuring benefits so that customers are paying more out of pocket for medications. Scrutiny is also on pharmacy benefits managers, the mysterious third parties that often oversee drug transactions and take a cut of the profits for themselves.\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Carolyn Y. Johnson meticulously documented how the drug industry has successfully put its industry adversaries under the microscope in the price debate. It\u2019s been a campaign with millions of dollars and hundreds of hours of lobbying manpower behind it. \nThe drug industry is happy to take the credit for the paradigm shift, arguing that the campaign has had resonance because it highlights a real problem \u2014 the byzantine infrastructure that helps inflates drug costs.\n\u201cWe have been part of an education effort to broaden the bull\u2019s-eye,\u201d the industry insider told me. \u201cI want people to know as much as possible about where their health care dollars go.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a net win for drug companies. \u201cI think pharma is very happy to have the policy debate turn to the distribution chain,\u201d Monk said.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s agenda has reflected this new orientation. HHS has proposed changes to Medicare that would cut down on practices used by health plans disparaged by pharmaceutical companies. Those practices include not counting assistance that drugmakers provide to their customers toward the out-of-pocket maximum that Americans with private Medicare Part D plans are required to pay. \nThe administration is also reviewing changes to another federal program that gives certain hospitals a mandated discount on drug prices, which drug companies have long said is exploited by hospitals without benefiting patients. \nAt the FDA, Gottlieb has been praised by all sides for the steps his agency has taken to encourage more generic competition: The agency approved 1,000 generics in 2017. But that is an area where drugmakers have said they are willing to compromise \u2014 because they prefer to make it easier for cheaper generic drugs to come to the market than to have more direct government intervention.\n\u201cScott is quite sincere and doing what he can on the generic competition,\u201d Nichols said, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much nice little window dressing around the edges.\u201d\nThese are all real issues, experts say: Health plans and pharmacy benefits managers do share some of the blame for the high costs that Americans are paying out of pocket. Increased generic competition should do something to help get more cheap drugs on the market. The hospitals drug program might be in need of more scrutiny.\nBut they all have something else in common: They aren\u2019t about the list prices that pharmaceutical companies set when they introduce a new drug. Lowering the out-of-pocket costs that normal people feel is worthwhile, Walid Gellad, a co-director at the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh, told me. But that won\u2019t bring down the gross costs of prescription drugs.\nAnd as long as those costs remain high, somebody is going to pay the bill. Health insurers could be required to reduce what some people pay out of pocket for medicine, but if they are, then they will simply raise premiums on everybody to make up for it.\n\u201cEverybody still talks about drug prices, but most of the time, they\u2019re talking about the cost sharing for drugs,\u201d Gellad said. \u201cThe efforts that we\u2019ve seen so far are meant to reduce what people pay, but they\u2019re not going to reduce drug prices.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re just going to raise premiums, or try to offset it another way,\u201d he said of insurance plans. \u201cSomeone\u2019s gonna pay the price if the price doesn\u2019t come down.\u201d\nSo the systematic problems are still there \u2014 though pharma would counter that their medicines provide a unique value to the health care system, keeping costs down over the long term, and dismiss critics who they say won\u2019t be satisfied unless the industry takes a direct hit. \nBut the point is: Nobody, especially President Trump, is really talking about prices anymore.\n\u201cPatient out-of-pocket costs are certainly a problem that needs to be addressed,\u201d Sachs said, \u201cbut it can\u2019t be the solution to drug pricing.\u201d\nPharma is trying to behave itself \u2014 sort of \u2014 to avoid Trump\u2019s wrath\nAllergan CEO Brent Saunders famously promised in fall 2016, before Trump\u2019s win but while drug prices were still the dominant health care issue, that his company would not raise any list prices higher than 10 percent as part of a \u201csocial contract.\u201d\nOther companies have done the same. Long frustrated that industry outsiders like Shkreli have given their sector a bad name, the big-time pharmaceutical firms have been doing what they can to avoid bad headlines and risk bringing Trump\u2019s ferocious anger back down on them.\n\u201cThe restraint, I think, is because the industry\u2019s savvy and they\u2019re not tone-deaf to the tenor of things,\u201d the industry insider told me. \u201cNobody is smarter than the people in this industry. It\u2019s not a cynical view. It\u2019s the opposite. They are not going to do stupid, self-destructive things.\u201d\nIn other words, the pharmaceutical industry is hoping to stay out of the headlines \u2014 and Trump\u2019s Twitter feed \u2014 by keeping their price hikes in check.  Just this month, drugmakers announced a new spate of price hikes, but they largely stayed within that 10 percent limit, Reuters reported. \nIt\u2019s smart politics for the drug industry, but experts warn against creating a new status quo where 10 percent raises are seen as the norm \u2014 or, worse, as restraint.\n\u201cIf we say it\u2019s okay to have single-digit price increases, we\u2019re saying it\u2019s okay for a price to double in seven or eight years. No one should think that that\u2019s okay, or that\u2019s self-policing,\u201d Gellad said. \u201cThe idea that high-single-digit price increases are somehow okay is mind-boggling.\u201d\nIt also gives the false impression that list prices are the only way drug companies can pad their profits.\nAllergan \u2014 the trendsetter on self-imposed limits on price increases \u2014 got into trouble with a federal judge late last year for trying to sell its expiring patents on some of its drugs to a Native American tribe to extend the life of the patent and maintain its monopoly on the drugs for a while longer, which would bring in millions of dollars in additional revenue.\nThe convoluted scheme never attracted the same level of outrage as Martin Shkreli or the price hikes for EpiPens and insulin, perhaps because it dealt with the minutiae of US patent law, an area essential for pharmaceutical firms but far more impenetrable to the average American than tripling a drug\u2019s price.\nThe Trump presidency isn\u2019t over, of course, not by a long shot. Industry officials are still on guard after his vitriolic entry into office.\nRight now, HHS is actually reviewing a waiver for Massachusetts to allow its Medicaid program to more aggressively restrict access to certain drugs as a negotiating tactic with drugmakers. How the administration responds could signal whether it is willing to take steps to deliver on Trump\u2019s promises. \nBut so far, Trump is taking it easy on pharma.\n\u201cThey want to lower drug prices without hurting the industry\u2019s revenue,\u201d Gellad said. \u201cEverything the administration has done so far seems to fall in that category.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Tara Golshan", "body": "On Wednesday, the White House released a statement expressing President Donald Trump\u2019s support for the omnibus, a $1.3 trillion funding package that would majorly boost military and domestic programs. Thirty-six hours later, Trump was threatening to veto the bill and shut down the government over Twitter.\n\nHe ultimately didn\u2019t follow through, begrudgingly signing the omnibus Friday afternoon. But the apparent break down in the intervening hours opened a window into the Republican Party\u2019s strategy with Trump: how congressional leaders try to keep business moving as usual under an extremely unusual \u2014 and often unpredictable \u2014 president.\n\nTo a degree, Trump\u2019s frustrations with the spending bill were understandable; the final spending package ignored most of the White House\u2019s hardline immigration agenda. It reined in funding for immigrant detention facilities, didn\u2019t defund so-called \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d and barely touched the border wall. Yet again, the deep ideological division between the White House and Republicans on Capitol Hill had reared its head.\n\nBut for nearly a day, House Speaker Paul Ryan sold Trump on everything else: a bill that would boost military spending, address the opioid crisis, and even put $1.6 billion toward border wall funding (the part about how all that money came with a lot of restrictions was likely left out of the pitch). \n\nThis is a story about how Republican leaders nearly failed to execute what has become a road-tested strategy with Trump: keeping him from reality.\n\nTrump gave in this time. But he had a warning for Congress: \u201cNever again.\u201d\n\nRepublicans had to spin the spending bill not just for voters, but for Trump\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had been dispatched to sell the president on the spending bill. It was a success.\n\n\u201cThe President and the leaders discussed their support for the bill, which includes more funds to rebuild the military, such as the largest pay raise for our troops in a decade, more than 100 miles of new construction for the border wall and other key domestic priorities,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders released in a statement shortly after the meeting. \n\nThat night, Trump declared victory on Twitter: He had won $1.6 billion in border wall funding and the biggest budget for the military in history. He griped about having to make wasteful spending concessions to Democrats, but it seemed like water under the bridge.\n\nThe next morning, Ryan went on Fox  Friends \u2014 one of Trump\u2019s favorite morning shows, which he often live-tweets \u2014 reaffirming the president\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cThis is the Trump-Jim Mattis budget for the military,\u201d Ryan said on air. \u201cThis funds the wall, fixes the military, fights opioids, does the things that we said and does not fund Gateway \u2014 gives Donald Trump the decision on Gateway.\u201d\n\nThe strategy became clear: focus Trump on the military spending. Repeat the $1.6 billion number. \n\nThe reality, of course, was very different. \n\nSure, the spending bill does include some border wall funding \u2014 $1.6 billion worth (which is much less than the $25 billion the White House asked for) \u2014 but it comes with a lot of strings attached; most of the funding will have to go toward repairing existing fencing or toward double fencing where barriers already exist. In other words, this isn\u2019t money for Trump\u2019s big, beautiful wall. Overall, the spending bill largely dismissed Trump\u2019s immigration agenda.\n\nYes, the $900 million infrastructure spending proposal for Gateway, a commuter rail and tunnel proposal connecting New York and New Jersey, which Trump threatened to veto the spending bill over, was left out \u2014 but there was more than $500 million in grants and Amtrak funding that could be allocated toward Gateway without the Department of Transportation\u2019s stamp of approval.\n\nHow the \u201cTrump-Jim Mattis budget\u201d became the \u201cswamp budget\u201d\nRyan wasn\u2019t on Fox  Friends Friday morning, and it showed.

It was the \u201cswamp budget.\u201d Fox contributor Pete Hegseth called it a \u201cMitch McConnell special.\u201d He said there was \u201cno wall\u201d and that Democrats had taken over the process in the Senate.\n\n\n\nOn Fox  Friends this morning, Pete Hegseth said of the omnibus, \"this is a swamp budget, this is a Mitch McConnell special,\" savaged it because \"no wall.\" pic.twitter.com/tTAIWj5til\n\u2014 Matthew Gertz (@MattGertz) March 23, 2018\n\n\n\n\nWe can\u2019t say for sure that Trump was watching Friday morning. But that\u2019s almost beside the point. The departure from Republican leaders\u2019 spin was a show of the deep ideological divides within the Republican Party. Conservatives overwhelmingly came out against this spending bill for liberal spending on domestic programs and a lack of policy wins. It didn\u2019t defund Planned Parenthood or sanctuary cities, and it didn\u2019t prioritize school choice.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus, a group of the House\u2019s most conservative lawmakers, called it an \u201cinsult to America\u2019s taxpayers, as well as their many rank-and-file representatives who had no say in the omnibus negotiations.\u201d Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) a deficit hawk, called it \u201cgrotesque,\u201d and Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) took it one step further, saying the bill was a \u201cgreat-dane-sized whiz down the leg of every taxpayer in this country.\u201d \n\nAnd as Vox reported last week, the White House, which often espouses the views of Congress\u2019s most conservative hardliners, had increasingly grown dissatisfied with the spending bill over immigration. Trump officials had even been back-channeling conservative ideas with conservative allies on Capitol Hill. Needless to say, Trump\u2019s base wasn\u2019t going to like this spending bill.\n\nBy Friday morning, reality had set in once again. At 8:55 am, Trump was threatening a veto.\n\n\n\nI am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\n\u2014 Donald J.

He called the spending fight a \u201cridiculous situation,\u201d censuring Democrats for \u201cwasting\u201d money on domestic programs.

Gates has been in negotiations with Mueller\u2019s team about cooperating for over a month, their report says, citing sources familiar with the case. \nBack in October, Mueller\u2019s team indicted Gates and Manafort on a combined 12 counts that mostly focused on alleged money laundering, failure to disclose financial assets, and false statements regarding their work for the government of Ukraine and a Russia-affiliated Ukrainian political party \u2014 matters that didn\u2019t have anything specific to do with Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. (Both pleaded not guilty.)\nBut apparently, Mueller didn\u2019t intend to stop there. The special counsel\u2019s team had prepared superseding indictments that would add to or replace the original charges against both Manafort and Gates, per an earlier CNN report. Facing an expensive legal defense with no end in sight, Gates signed a new lawyer who has been working on cutting him a plea deal.\nThe biggest question, though, is whether Gates\u2019s possible flip is mainly bad news for Paul Manafort concerning those lobbying and money laundering charges ... or whether it would have even bigger implications for the investigation into Russian interference as a whole, and into President Trump specifically.\nBecause if Manafort were to know of anything that could implicate Trump in connection with Russia, it seems quite plausible Gates would know it too.\nWho is Rick Gates?\nBasically, Gates is Paul Manafort\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and right hand man, who was at his side during his past decade of lobbying and foreign work, before going with him to join the Trump campaign.\nManafort, who is two decades older than Gates, had worked for Republican politicians, controversial dictators, and corporate interests before his career took a turn in the mid-2000s. He \u201call but vanished from the Washington scene\u201d and began focusing on business activities in Eastern Europe, as Politico later reported. \nThis began with advising work for the Russian oligarch and aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, and soon moved into the political realm with advising work for the Party of Regions \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian political party \u2014 and its leader, Viktor Yanukovych. \nGates joined Manafort\u2019s firm in 2006 and began managing much of its Eastern Europe portfolio soon afterward, often working out of Kiev, according to the New York Times. In particular, Gates was to run a new private equity company called Pericles that Manafort was starting, to fund investments in Ukraine and Russia.\nBut in recent years, these business ventures went awry. President Yanukovych was forced to flee Ukraine due to protests and clashes over his pro-Russian policies. Pericles, meanwhile, collapsed in a messy legal battle, as Deripaska, its leading funder,  accused Manafort and Gates of cheating him of millions. (An essential recent profile of Manafort by Franklin Foer in the Atlantic has more details on the pair\u2019s Ukrainian work.)\nThen, as part of an effort from Donald Trump to professionalize his presidential campaign, he brought Manafort aboard in March 2016. With Manafort came Gates. And as the original campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, saw his star fall, Manafort\u2019s portfolio gradually expanded until he was effectively running the whole operation. In mid-May, Manafort was officially named campaign chair and chief strategist. \nThough Trump fired Manafort in August 2016, Gates stayed on with the campaign through the general election, and later served on Trump\u2019s inaugural committee and worked at a pro-Trump outside group until March 2017.\nWhat was Rick Gates was indicted for?\nOn October 30, 2017, in the first public indictments of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Manafort and Gates were charged with a total of 12 counts.\nThe gist of the charges was that Manafort and Gates \u201cacted as unregistered agents\u201d of the government of Ukraine and Ukrainian politicians, generating \u201ctens of millions of dollars in income\u201d which they then \u201claundered\u201d through \u201cscores of United States and foreign corporations, partnerships, and bank accounts.\u201d You can read the full indictment here.\nIt\u2019s helpful to think of the charges in two separate but related buckets: one is money laundering, and the second is false statements or failure to disclosure foreign work.\nOn the money laundering front, Manafort and Gates were both charged with a broader \u201cconspiracy to launder money\u201d and separate specific charges on their failure to report foreign bank and financial accounts.\nThen there are the false statements and failure to disclose charges. They are:\n\nActing as an unregistered agent of the government of Ukraine, its then president and one of its major political parties.\nMaking false and misleading statements under the Foreign Agents Registration Act related to that Ukraine work.\n\nNow, these charges don\u2019t necessarily seem to have anything to do with potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia \u2014 Mueller\u2019s main investigative job. \nBut he likely saw these separate charges against Manafort and Gates as a means to this end. The stronger the evidence he has against either or both of them, the more pressure he can exert to get them to cooperate in the probe into Russian interference.\nWould Gates be flipping just on Manafort \u2014 or on Trump?\nGates is far younger than Manafort (he\u2019s only 45 years old), and he has young children. So though Gates pleaded not guilty, speculation almost immediately began over whether he might flip to avoid a long prison sentence. \nThe big question, though, is just what this flipping might entail \u2014 and whom Gates might implicate.\nIt is possible that Gates\u2019s cooperation would primarily be useful to Mueller as a means to pressure Manafort further. After all, Gates certainly has in-depth knowledge about Manafort\u2019s activities over the past decade-plus. His cooperation could make it easier to make a case against Manafort \u2014 or to get Manafort himself to flip.\nBut there are other possibilities as well.\nAfter all, Gates worked on the Trump campaign. And unlike his fellow cooperator George Papadopoulos, he actually had a high-level job there which had him work quite closely with the person running the campaign for several months: Manafort.\nFor instance, there have been recent reports that Mueller is keenly interested in the White House\u2019s story about the June 9, 2016 meeting Donald Trump Jr. arranged with a Russian lawyer in Trump Tower for purposes of getting dirt on Hillary Clinton.\nGates wasn\u2019t at that meeting \u2014 but Manafort was. And if anything inappropriate involving Russian interference with the campaign did happen there, one person Manafort just might tell could be his close friend and business partner of over a decade, Rick Gates.\nThat is to say that, while Gates\u2019s potential cooperation could just be about providing information on Manafort\u2019s business, it\u2019s not out of the question that it\u2019s about providing information on potential collusion with Russia. \nIt is also worth noting that Mueller has also looked closely into events during the transition period after Trump won but before he was sworn in. And while Gates didn\u2019t officially work on the transition, he worked as the deputy chair of Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, so he was in the president-elect\u2019s orbit at the time.\nSo if Gates does flip, the bigger picture is that Mueller would then three former Trump aides \u2014 that we know of \u2014 cooperating and providing him with information. If criminal collusion did happen, that would put the special counsel in a better position than ever to uncover it.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Alex Ward", "body": "Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have concluded their year-long investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Mike Conaway (R-TX), the leader of the committee\u2019s investigation, told reporters on Monday, adding that there was \u201cperhaps some bad judgment, inappropriate meetings, inappropriate judgment at taking meetings,\u201d but nothing that amounted to a coordinated and deliberate effort to work with Russians to win the White House. \n\n\u201c[O]nly Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn or someone else like that could take these series of inadvertent contacts with each other, meetings, whatever, and weave that into some sort of a fiction and turn it into a page-turner, spy thriller,\u201d Conaway said.\n\nHe also said that while Republicans on the committee agree that Russia did interfere in the 2016 presidential election, they \u201cdisagree with the narrative that they were trying to help Trump.\u201d \n\nThat directly contradicts the US intelligence community assessment from January 2017, which clearly states that Russia wanted Trump to win. It also contradicts special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s indictment of 13 Russians for working to help Trump win by sowing divisions via the Internet.\n\nNone of this is likely to satisfy Democrats on the committee, who have consistently argued that Republicans had no real intention of finding out the truth. For example, Democrats claim Republicans didn\u2019t use the full power of the committee to subpoena documents or compel further testimony that key witnesses withheld from investigators. \n\nCommittee Democrats also say that Republicans on the committee never interviewed key witnesses including former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and Manafort\u2019s associate Rick Gates \u2014 all of whom special counsel Robert Mueller has indicted in his investigation. \n\nAccording to CNN, Conaway hadn\u2019t told Rep.

Devin Nunes (R-CA), claimed the FBI illegally surveilled a low-level Trump foreign policy adviser. In response, Schiff, Nunes\u2019s counterpart on the committee, wrote his own memo rebutting Nunes\u2019s account point by point. \n\nThe drama surrounding the differing accounts led to a public, partisan fight about whether or not the FBI is politically biased against Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the Democrats will choose to release their own report, contradicting the GOP\u2019s effort. In other words, expect that yawning partisan gap to widen even further. \n\nRepublicans, who will show their 150-page report to Democrats on Tuesday, will likely use their report as fodder for their campaign to protect Trump. In fact, they might even use it to further delegitimize \u2014 and demonize \u2014 special counsel Robert Mueller probe into Trump-Russia collusion.

He doesn\u2019t move the public. He cannot reach out beyond people already committed to him.\u201d\nBut there is another Trump presidency \u2014 that of Donald J. Trump, reality television star and international brand. This is the presidency that I suspect matters more to Trump himself, the one that he pursues during his morning \u201cexecutive time,\u201d the one he furthers with every tweet, the one he obsessively monitors on cable news. This is the presidency for which the measures of achievement aren\u2019t bills passed or jobs created but headlines grabbed and mindshare held. \nThis is the presidency that, for all its collateral damage, is succeeding beyond Trump\u2019s wildest dreams. This is the presidency that few have figured out how to resist. \nTrump\u2019s law: attention creates value\nThe secret to Trump\u2019s success, the insight that has separated him from his competitors, is that he has cared less about the nature of the coverage he received than that he received coverage at all. \n\u201cEven a critical story, which may be hurtful personally, can be very valuable to your business,\u201d Trump said in his 1987 book The Art of the Deal. He goes on to recall the lesson he learned being attacked for a particularly gaudy skyscraper he sought to build. \u201cThe point,\u201d he says, \u201cis that we got a lot of attention, and that alone creates value.\u201d\nThis is the law by which Trump lives his life. Attention creates value, at least for him. Before Trump, every politician hewed to the same basic rule: You want as much positive coverage, and as little negative coverage, as possible. Trump upended that. \nHis rule, his realization, is that you want as much coverage as possible, full stop. If it\u2019s positive coverage, great. If it\u2019s negative coverage, so be it. The point is that it\u2019s coverage \u2014 that you\u2019re the story, that you\u2019re squeezing out your competitors, that you\u2019re on people\u2019s minds. \nThis was Trump\u2019s true political innovation: He realized that presidential campaigns \u2014 and particularly presidential primaries \u2014 had become reality shows, and the path to victory was to get the most attention, even if much of that attention was negative.\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nIn this, Trump either intuited or stumbled into a profound insight about the media: It\u2019s easier to get bad press than good press. There is an old line about the media: We don\u2019t cover the planes that land safely. Most politicians try to get media coverage while landing the plane safely. They stage photo ops at factories, give prepared statements, deliver carefully crafted speeches. The result is dull, predictable, normal \u2014 and ignored. \nTrump dominates news cycle after news cycle by crashing planes into Twitter. He is everywhere, seemingly all the time. He says things no national politician in history would have dared say, things that the press covers because they are outrageous, controversial, unnerving, appalling. \nTrump is demanding and receiving our attention, crowding out everything else, accepting that it\u2019s better to be hated than to be ignored.\n\u201cThere is a range of Trump coverage and attention that a conventional politician would find devastating that Trump finds exhilarating,\u201d says Ron Klain, who served as chief of staff to Vice Presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden.  \nEvery so often, someone will suggest that we just ignore Trump\u2019s words, his riffs, his tweets. But Trump controls a nuclear arsenal. His tweets are \u201cconsidered official statements by the president of the United States,\u201d according to Sean Spicer, who served as Trump\u2019s first press secretary. \nThese are words that start wars, that drive deportations, that set policy, that end negotiations, that empower bigots, that reveal scandals, that represent our country. That the president of the United States is acting outrageously, or worryingly, or offensively, is important. As much as Trump might treat his presidency like a reality show, it remains a presidency, and lives are in the balance.\nYet in owning our attention, in driving the agenda, in setting both the terms and tone of the debate, and in doing so by generating constant negative attention, cultural conflict, and emotional alarm, Trump makes us a little more like him, and politics a little more like the tribal clash he says it is.\nTrump is winning. The country is losing. \nTwo weeks ago, Trump, after much fanfare, held his \u201cFake News Awards.\u201d He had teased the event on Twitter for weeks, sending journalists into paroxysms of mockery and frustration. This was, as so much is with Trump, an exercise that was simultaneously ridiculous and dangerous, comic and illiberal. The \u201cawards\u201d turned out to be complaints about stories Trump had already complained about, tied to a fundraising plea for the Republican Party. \nIn response, many in the media played into his hands, joking that it was an honor just to be considered, lamenting that they didn\u2019t win, acting out of anger and exhaustion more like the opposition party he says we are.\n\u201cIt says so much about our current media moment that the president would announce plans to shame news organizations with his first-annual \u2018Fake News Awards\u2019 and every reporter would be praying to God they made the list,\u201d wrote Kyle Pope, the editor of the Columbia Journalism Review. \nTrump drives his opponents to respond in kind, to adopt just a little more of his tone and language and pitch. Twitter swells with jabs and nicknames, cries of \u201cSad!\u201d and \u201cFake news!\u201d Even when it doesn\u2019t succumb to that behavior, the media is laser-focused on Trump\u2019s words, behavior, decisions, grievances. America ends up having the fights Trump wants us to have.\nTrump understands this power. He knows he can wrest the news cycle back at a moment\u2019s notice. In September, amidst Puerto Rico\u2019s misery and bad news for the GOP\u2019s congressional agenda, Trump lashed out at kneeling NFL protestors, creating a multi-week firestorm that didn\u2019t have policy stakes, but drove a deep wedge into our cultural divisions. \n\n\nSports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017\n\n\n\nThe whole episode was, again, a mixture the surreal and the scary. Here was the President of the United States choosing to ignite a racialized controversy, telling the mostly white attendees at his rallies that \u201cpeople like yourselves\u201d shouldn\u2019t have to see \u201cthose people\u201d kneeling during the anthem. Trump sent Vice President Mike Pence to an NFL game with instructions to walk out if the players kneeled \u2014 which was exactly what happened. It was a transparent effort to distract us, to inflame our divisions, to lure us to have the fight Trump wanted to have rather than continue discussing his flailing governance.\nAnd yet it worked. Coverage of this was everywhere \u2014 it dominated not just the political press, but also sports media. Trump\u2019s opponents were angry \u2014 the president was a racist, he was dismissing police brutality, he was turning us against each other. His supporters were indignant \u2014 the president was a patriot, he was defending the flag and the country. There were takes, late-night comedy bits, searching interviews, angry tweets, earnest explainers. \nBy the time Trump was done, the NFL, which had previously been viewed favorably by both Democratic and Republican voters, had become one of the most divisive brands in the US. Trump had successfully made us angrier at each other, he had absorbed more of American life into the tribalized war of our politics and he had done so on his terms. \nThe NFL skirmish was one of many clashes Trump caused during his first year in office. As this analysis from Echelon Insights shows, Trump dominated the national conversation on almost every day of 2017, and that was true no matter whether you looked at liberals or conservatives or political elites or everyone. The mindshare he occupies, the energy he consumes, is vast:\n\nI say none of this from atop a soapbox. I am as guilty of it as anyone, and more guilty of it than most. \nI find it hard to resist commenting on Trump\u2019s tweets. I find it hard to tear myself away from his daily outrages, even when I know they\u2019re less important than other things I could cover. I find it hard not to respond to him in kind, not to let his language, his energy, his approach, infect mine. \nBut there is a cost to this. \nPart of the cost is political. Trump sees the world as zero-sum tribal warfare, and the way he operates, the way he acts, the rage and fear and shock he calls forth in his opponents, makes it more so. As my colleague Matt Yglesias observes, this seems, on the margins, to work for Trump \u2014 his approval ratings rise slightly in periods in which the news is dominated by angry clashes over his behavior, and fall when the story turns back to the more ordinary outrages of his policy agenda.\nPart of the cost is social. Keeping politics at this pitch for four years is a terrible strain on an already divided country. Dozens of news stories have recorded psychologists reporting patients streaming into their office with Trump-related anxiety. Trump is deepening the threats we feel \u2014 and, in some cases, the threats we truly face \u2014 from each other; he is breaking us into warring factions in the hopes that that collision will strengthen his supporters\u2019 loyalty to him. \nSome of it is an opportunity cost \u2014 there are so many other conversations we could be having, so many other stories we could be covering. It is hard, amid Trump, to see beyond Trump \u2014 to the technological changes transforming our society, to the international forces reshaping our world, to the leaders and doers who are building a better future.\nThere is a section of Michael Wolff\u2019s Fire and Fury that has stuck with me. It speaks to the size of Trump\u2019s achievement, the unprecedented nature of his success, and it is true: \n\n[I]t might be a central tragedy of the news media that its old-fashioned and even benighted civic-minded belief that politics is the highest form of news has helped transform it from a mass business to a narrow-cast one. ... Politics has gone one way, the culture another. The left-right junkies might pretend otherwise, but the great middle doesn\u2019t put political concerns at the top of their minds. \nAnd yet, contravening all cultural and media logic, Donald Trump produced on a daily basis an astonishing, can\u2019t-stop-following-it narrative. And this was not even because he was changing or upsetting the fundamentals of American life. In six months as president, failing to master almost any aspect of the bureaucratic process, he had, beyond placing his nominee on the Supreme Court, accomplished, practically speaking, nothing. And yet, OMG!!! There almost was no other story in America \u2014  and in much of the world. That was the radical and transformational nature of the Trump presidency: it held everybody\u2019s attention. \n\nThis is, I think, Trump\u2019s true purpose in public life: to have everyone talking about him, looking at him, reacting to him. He cares more about his coverage than his impact; he is much more committed to what\u2019s said about him on Fox  Friends than what\u2019s written about him in the history books. Trump\u2019s Reality Show White House has been an unstoppable force, dominating our attention, coarsening our politics, making us angrier and more afraid and more distant from each other. In this, he\u2019s succeeding \u2014 winning, even.\nIt is easy to dismiss this dimension of Trump\u2019s presidency. Does it really matter if the president is heightening the conflicts in political life, if he is deepening our cultural divides, if he is activating and validating our tribal identities and hatreds every time he turns on his phone? It does. \nIn their book Why Washington Won\u2019t Work, political scientists March Hetherington and Thomas Rudolph identify trust as an essential component of functional political systems. The more we mistrust each other, the more we fear each other, the harder it is for politics to function, for politicians to justify compromise, for parties to accept the legitimacy of the other side. \n\u201cPartisans today are polarized not in their policy preferences but rather in their feelings about each other,\u201d write Hetherington and Rudolph. \u201cAs a result, political trust has polarized by party, leading to an absence of policy consensus and a gridlocked political system with little incentive to compromise.\u201d\nThis is a theme that Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt pick up in How Democracies Die:\nWhen parties view one another as mortal enemies, the stakes of political competition heighten dramatically. Losing ceases to be a routine and accepted part of the political process and instead becomes a full-blown catastrophe. When the perceived cost of losing is sufficiently high, politicians will be tempted to abandon forbearance. Acts of constitutional hardball may then in turn further undermine mutual toleration, reinforcing beliefs that our rivals pose a dangerous threat.\nEven before Trump, American politics was becoming dangerously angry, polarized, bitter. In this, Trump\u2019s rise is more symptom than cause. But his presidency has been an accelerant, and the consequences of it are yet untold.\nThere are three years left in Trump\u2019s term. It will not be good for the country if they all feel like Trump\u2019s first.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Dylan Scott", "body": "The next battle in the Republican civil war is taking shape in Mississippi.\n\nThere, in the deep South, 80-year-old Republican Sen. Thad Cochran is retiring after four decades in the Senate. He will soon be replaced by a new senator appointed by Gov. Phil Bryant, who has been in close contact with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell over the past few months as it became clear that Cochran\u2019s health would not allow him to serve much longer. Cochran\u2019s seat will be on the ballot in November \u2014 and hard-right conservatives have had their eye on Mississippi for months.\n\nCould it be Alabama all over again?\n\nWaiting in the wings is conservative insurgent Chris McDaniel, a former state senator with ties to the neo-Confederate movement, who was prepared to challenge Mississippi\u2019s other Republican senator at Steve Bannon\u2019s urging. But now he\u2019s running for Cochran\u2019s open seat.\n\nMcDaniel already challenged Cochran in a bitterly contested 2014 Republican primary  \u2014 it involved a break-in and a suicide \u2014 and to this day his supporters contend that election was stolen from him in part because many of the black voters in the state lined up behind Cochran. \n\nMcDaniel could triumph among Republicans. But his history of racially charged remarks in a state that is one-third black could make him vulnerable against a good Democratic candidate.\n\n\u201cMississippi is a red state, but I think most people would be surprised to learn that [John] McCain only won the state by 13 points, and [Mitt] Romney by 12. It is actually substantially less red than Alabama,\u201d Sean Trende, an elections analyst at RealClearPolitics, told me in an email. When you add it all up, Mississippi is a \u201clighter load than Alabama.\u201d\n\nThen you have the Trump factor. Right now, he is refusing to back Bryant\u2019s choice for the Cochran seat, which could set the stage for an insurgent upset on the GOP side.\n\nMississippi\u2019s senate race should be a familiar drama \u2014 the establishment versus the far-right wing, McConnell versus Bannon. GOP leaders are clearly maneuvering, based on all the available reporting, to appoint a viable replacement who will be able to hold off McDaniel and keep the seat safely red in November. \n\nThe race shaping up has some election watchers seeing Alabama again: An ultra-conservative prevails against the GOP establishment\u2019s preferred candidate and then falters in a race against a Democratic candidate with the right credentials to compete in the deep South.\n\nChris McDaniel versus the Republican establishment, explained\nFirst things first: The Mississippi race will be a jungle primary. That means every candidate runs in the first race on Election Day in November. If one candidate gets 50 percent of the total vote, they win. But if they don\u2019t \u2014 and it seems unlikely, with a strong Democratic candidate and a fractured GOP field \u2014 the top two candidates face each other in a runoff election that same month. (One of them could be the Democrat \u2014 who we\u2019ll get to in a bit.)\n\nMcDaniel is in. He was originally going to challenge Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), a favorite target of alt-right mastermind and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. McDaniel had discussed his Wicker challenge with Bannon before announcing, Mississippi Today reported last fall, and his potential candidacy had received favorable coverage on Breitbart, Bannon\u2019s former employer. But McDaniel switched over to the open Cochran race after the senator said that he would step down in April.\n\nIt probably doesn\u2019t make much difference to Bannon, who clearly sees Mississippi as fertile ground for the alt-right populist revolution he is still trying to get off the ground.\n\n\u201cMitch McConnell is a literal anchor tied to the hips of folks like Roger Wicker and Thad Cochran,\u201d Andy Surabian, a Bannon adviser, told NBC News last fall. \u201cWe expect the anti-establishment wave we are seeing across the country today to hit Mississippi like a tsunami in 2018 and beyond.\u201d\n\nBryant\u2019s pick to replace Cochran on April 1 instead is Cindy Hyde-Smith, the state\u2019s agriculture commissioner. She would be Mississippi\u2019s first woman senator.\n\nMcDaniel had once upon a time lobbied Bryant to name him as Cochran\u2019s replacement, the Washington Post reported, but the governor was not interested.\n\nThere is a lot of bad blood between McDaniel and the Republican establishment, leftover from the 2014 primary. Bryant even took a swing at McDaniel this week after the state senator announced that he would switch from the Wicker to the Cochran race.\n\n\u201cThis opportunistic behavior is a sad commentary for a young man who once had great potential,\u201d Bryant told the Jackson Clarion-Ledger. \n\nThe newspaper reported that Bryant was looking for a candidate who was particularly well suited to beating McDaniel. The governor seems to have settled on Hyde-Smith, but the White House and Washington Republicans aren\u2019t on board with his choice. Politico reported Wednesday that Trump won\u2019t campaign for or endorse Hyde-Smith because the White House is worried her history as a Democrat (she switched parties in 2010) could make her vulnerable.\n\nThe Post reported last month that McConnell had urged Bryant to appoint himself to the Senate. He would be the strongest possible candidate in the fall election, having won a number of statewide elections since the 1990s and currently possessing an approval rating above 50 percent.\n\nBryant passed up the Senate seat, but he clearly shares the establishment\u2019s interest in stopping McDaniel. Which brings us back to 2014.\n\nLet\u2019s remember how absolutely surreal the 2014 campaign was\nMcDaniel has to be taken seriously because he mounted a very credible challenge against Cochran in 2014. Let\u2019s start with the math: In the first round of the GOP\u2019s jungle primary that year, McDaniel actually got more votes (49.5 percent) than Cochran (49 percent) \u2014 a man named Thomas Carey got the remaining votes. But McDaniel did not get the needed 50 percent, so he and Cochran had a rematch.\n\nIn that showdown, Cochran narrowly prevailed over McDaniel, 51 percent to 49 percent, but not without a lot of bitterness and allegations of wrongdoing on both sides.\n\nBut those are the vote totals. That\u2019s not the memorable part. In brief \u2014 and to understand why Bryant and other establishment Republicans are so hellbent on beating McDaniel this year \u2014 here is your unofficial rundown of the 2014 Mississippi primary, courtesy of Talking Points Memo:\n\n\nA 26-year-old blogger and McDaniel supporter \u2014 nicknamed \u201cConstitutional Clayton\u201d \u2014 broke into the nursing home where Cochran\u2019s wife resides and took pictures of her for an attack ad accusing the senator of infidelity with one of his aides.\nThat blogger later went to jail for the break-in conspiracy. On a more tragic note, one of his alleged conspirators committed suicide during the investigation.\nChuck Johnson, the infamous conservative raconteur, accused the Cochran campaign of bribing black voters to support the senator.\nJohnson was later investigated by the Mississippi attorney general for his report and allegations that he actually bribed a source of the accusations he made against Cochran.\nBut after the election, the McDaniel campaign did file a lawsuit accusing the Cochran camp of soliciting Democratic votes, which they said would invalidate the results. The suit was eventually rejected by the state Supreme Court.\n\nIn other words, the McDaniel campaign tried to use the specter of black voters to delegitimize an election result \u2014 a problematic tactic, to say the least, given the state senator\u2019s history of racially charged remarks.\n\nThe 2014 race is still a sore point for everybody involved. Just this week, McDaniel said:\n\n\u201cWhat I have is a situation in which I\u2019m running for the same seat I ran for in 2014 \u2014 the seat we felt we won in 2014. Now God had other plans for that, obviously, and that\u2019s okay and we accept that. All I\u2019m asking for now is to be allowed to finish that term that we ran for in 2014.\u201d\n\nAnd that explains equally well, on the establishment side of the equation, why Bryant and other Republican leaders are so intent on defeating McDaniel again. McDaniel and his supporters had maligned Cochran, a titan of Mississippi Republican politics, and deployed dirtier-than-dirty tactics to try to unseat him.\n\nThe hypothetical path for another Democratic win in the Deep South\nAll of this leads to a pretty serious opening for Democrats. So who is the Democrat in this race? \n\nFormer Democratic Congress member Mike Espy \u2014 who comes with some of his own baggage after being acquitted of bribery charges in the 1990s \u2014 has already announced that he will run for Cochran\u2019s seat with the backing of Democrats in the state. The 64-year-old represented the Jackson area in Congress for six years before serving as President Bill Clinton\u2019s secretary of agriculture from 1993 to 1994. \n\nBut he was forced to step down amid an ethics investigation. Allegations were made that he improperly received airplane and sports tickets. Epsy was eventually acquitted on all charges, but it more or less ended his career in politics; he has been out of public office for nearly 25 years, spending the past decade as a private attorney.\n\nIf Espy proves to be a strong Democratic candidate, he will likely lock up one of the spots for the runoff election. That means the initial vote will function as a quasi-Republican primary: The top two GOP candidates will be vying to come in first or second and earn the right to face Epsy. And with Democratic turnout up all around the country, that could put Espy on the map in a real way. \n\n\u201cI think against a more traditional Southern Republican, you get maybe something that looks like the presidential numbers, tightened a bit for turnout,\u201d Trende told me.\n\nIt\u2019s far too early to say who will prevail in the Republican civil war: We don\u2019t even know who Bryant will appoint to Cochran\u2019s seat. If the establishment candidate wins, do not expect much of a race. Maybe things will be a little closer than usual.\n\nBut if McDaniel wins and faces Epsy in a one-on-one runoff, things start to get interesting.\n\nEpsy certainly starts with some challenges: He could have lost his skills in retail politics, he might not be adept at fundraising, etc. But if he shows up in game shape, he could have some real advantages in Mississippi against McDaniel.\n\nThe conservative candidate has a troubling list of, shall we say, racially charged rhetoric and affiliating with more openly racist people:\n\n\nHe spoke at a neo-Confederate conference in 2013.\nHe recently appeared on a radio show with a host who traffics in anti-Semitic 9/11 conspiracies.\nHe has blamed \u201chip-hop\u201d for gun violence, saying that it is \u201cmorally bankrupt\u201d and destroyed community values,\nTPM had a long rundown in 2014 of McDaniel\u2019s various remarks about reparations and \u201cmamacitas.\u201d\n\nWith some solid fundraising and spending, Epsy can turn out more black voters \u2014 already about one-third of the state\u2019s electorate \u2014 and he could then bring the race down to single digits, Trende told me.\n\n\u201cAt that point, you\u2019re really not talking about convincing that many whites to either state home or vote Democrat because of McDaniel\u2019s racialized statements,\u201d he said.\n\nEpsy, it should be noted, said kind words about Cochran as he announced his candidacy and the Clarion-Ledger wrote that Epsy has long been considered the model for the kind of black candidate who could win crossover white voters in Mississippi.\n\nWe\u2019re a long way from an Alabama-style upset coming to fruition in its neighbor state.

Moscow\u2019s representative initially vetoed the resolution on February 22, saying that reports of widespread civilian casualties were nothing more than \u201cmass psychosis.\u201d Instead, Russia proposed amendments that would allow it and Syrian forces to continue targeting anti-Assad groups. \n\nMore than 1,000 civilians have died in the Assad regime\u2019s accelerated air and ground campaign in Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of the capital Damascus, over the past month.\n\nAs for ISIS, Russia says it is in Syria to kill terrorists \u2014 which is also Trump\u2019s stated Syria policy \u2014 but has instead targeted anti-Assad rebels and indiscriminately bombed civilian areas. Last month, Russian mercenaries fought against US forces in Syria. No Americans died or received injuries, but about 200 Russians perished in the firefight.\n\nFinally, Russia is a major Iranian ally, and fights alongside Tehran in Syria. Iran provides fights and weaponry to its proxies and other militia groups, like Hezbollah, that help keep Assad in power. Russia has not condemned Iran\u2019s weapons influx into Syria.\n\nAnd here\u2019s one example: With Russian and Iranian help, Assad retook control of the major city of Aleppo in December 2016 after months of brutal fighting. That proved a turning point in the war and allowed Assad to regain control of the country.\n\nSo if Trump wants Putin to help in Syria, he\u2019ll have to convince Putin to do the opposite of everything he\u2019s tried to accomplish over the past few years.\n\nUkraine\nTrump\u2019s reference to the ongoing war there is particularly bizarre. Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014 and seized parts of Crimea, a southern peninsula, and eastern parts of the country. A low-level war has raged there ever since.\n\nBut to be extra clear: There would be no conflict in Ukraine if Russia had not invaded it. And as my colleague Zack Beauchamp reported, there are no signs the war will end any time soon.\n\nHere\u2019s why: A close Putin friend, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has a relationship with a mercenary group called Wagner. Wagner has reportedly played a major part in Russia\u2019s incursion, recruiting gunmen to fight on Russia\u2019s behalf without appearing in its uniform. Last summer, the US Treasury officially sanctioned Wagner and its director, Dmitry Utkin, for threatening \u201cthe peace, security, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nSo expect more Russian involvement in fueling Ukraine\u2019s war, not less.\n\n\u201cComing Arms Race\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear what Trump really meant by this, but here\u2019s a possibility: On March 1, Putin bragged during a major speech that his country now possed a nuclear-powered cruise missile that can reach the United States, nuclear weapons that can evade any missile defense system, and unstoppable drone submarines that could blow up foreign ports.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence Russia has any of these capabilities yet, but it made some experts nervous that Russia had more advanced weaponry than America. But Putin\u2019s boast was perhaps partially in response to the new Nuclear Posture Review the Pentagon released in February. The report details America\u2019s desire to develop newer and smaller nuclear bombs, in part to make them more usable.\n\nIn effect, Trump may be fueling an arms race with Moscow \u2014 even though he\u2019s asking for Russia\u2019s help to end the escalation.\n\nTrump clearly still thinks he can turn Putin from a foe to a friend. Putin seems likelier to take Trump\u2019s naivet\u00e9 and refusal to call his bluff as a green light to cause even more of the problems Trump keeps asking him to solve.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "German Lopez", "body": "It\u2019s going to happen again. There will be another mass shooting in America.\n\nIt\u2019s tragic to even write those words, but this is the clear pattern I\u2019ve seen since I began covering mass shootings for Vox in 2014: A horrific tragedy happens. There are calls for action. Maybe something gets introduced in Congress. The debate goes back and forth for a bit. Then people move on \u2014 usually after less than a week or two. And so there\u2019s eventually another shooting.\n\nAs a reporter, I have become eerily attuned to this horrible American ritual. I do the same thing every single time we get news of a mass shooting: verify reports, write a \u201cwhat we know\u201d article, and then begin to update our old pieces on guns. I do this almost instinctively at this point \u2014 and that terrifies me. No one should get used to this.\n\nThere are signs that the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, which killed at least 17 people and injured at least 14 others, could have a different outcome. There are protests already planned: the National School Walkout, the March for Our Lives, and more to come. Students with highly sympathetic stories are speaking up. The sense of outrage seems to be sustained in the week after the shooting.\n\n\u201cPoliticians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have ever been done to prevent this, we call BS,\u201d Emma Gonzales, a student survivor, said in a speech at a gun control rally that went viral. \u201cThey say that tougher gun laws do not decrease gun violence. We call BS. They say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun. We call BS. They say guns are just tools like knives and are as dangerous as cars. We call BS. \u2026 They say that no laws could have been able to prevent the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred. We call BS.\u201d\n\nBut I remain skeptical. The federal government did nothing after 6- and 7-year-olds were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 20 children, six adults, and himself in 2012. Since then, there have been more than 1,600 mass shootings, killing more than 1,800 people and wounding more than 6,400. Many of these events led to protests and calls for actions, but Congress refused to budge every time.\n\nAs I see it, the core issue is that America as a whole refuses to even admit it has a serious problem with guns and gun violence. And more than that, lawmakers continue acting like the solutions are some sort of mystery, as if there aren\u2019t years of research and experiences in other countries that show restrictions on firearms can save lives.\n\nConsider President Donald Trump\u2019s speech responding to the Florida shooting: His only mention of guns was a vague reference to \u201cgunfire\u201d as he described what happened. He never even brought up gun control or anything related to that debate, instead vaguely promising to work \u201cwith state and local leaders to help secure our schools and tackle the difficult issue of mental health.\u201d\n\nThis is America\u2019s elected leader \u2014 and he essentially, based on his public response, ignored what the real problem is. And although the White House has in recent days come around to bipartisan proposals to very slightly improve background checks and ban bump stocks, the compromises amount to fairly small changes to America\u2019s weak gun laws.\n\nIn my coverage of these shootings, I\u2019ve always focused on solutions through studies and policy ideas that would tamp down on the number of shootings. The good news is there are real solutions out there.\n\nBut America can\u2019t get to those solutions until it admits it has a gun problem and confronts the reality of what it would mean to seriously address it.\n\n1) America has a unique gun violence problem\nThe US is unique in two key \u2014 and related \u2014 ways when it comes to guns: It has way more gun deaths than other developed nations, and it has far more guns than any other country in the world.\n\nThe US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada, more than seven times that of Sweden, and nearly 16 times that of Germany, according to United Nations data compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.)\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Javier Zarracina/Vox\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nMass shootings actually make up a small fraction of America\u2019s gun deaths, constituting less than 2 percent of such deaths in 2013. But America does see a lot of these horrific events: According to CNN, \u201cThe US makes up less than 5% of the world\u2019s population, but holds 31% of global mass shooters.\u201d\n\nThe US also has by far the highest number of privately owned guns in the world. Estimated in 2007, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 88.8 guns per 100 people, meaning there was almost one privately owned gun per American and more than one per American adult. The world\u2019s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 54.8 guns per 100 people.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Max Fisher/Washington Post\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nAnother way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world\u2019s population yet own roughly 42 percent of all the world\u2019s privately held firearms.\n\nThese two facts \u2014 on gun deaths and firearm ownership \u2014 are related. The research, compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health\u2019s Injury Control Research Center, is pretty clear: After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths.\n\n\u201cWithin the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide,\u201d David Hemenway, the Injury Control Research Center\u2019s director, wrote in Private Guns, Public Health.\n\nThis chart, from researcher Josh Tewksbury, shows the correlation between the number of guns and gun deaths among wealthier nations:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Josh Tewksbury\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nGuns are not the only contributor to violence. (Other factors include, for example, poverty, urbanization, and alcohol consumption.) But when researchers control for other confounding variables, they have found time and time again that America\u2019s high levels of gun ownership are a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers. \n\n2) The problem is guns, not mental illness\nSupporters of gun rights look at America\u2019s high levels of gun violence and argue that guns are not the problem. They point to other issues, from violence in video games and movies to the breakdown of the traditional family.\n\nMost recently, they\u2019ve focused particularly on mental health. This is the only policy issue that Trump mentioned in his speech following the Florida shooting.\n\nBut as Dylan Matthews explained for Vox, people with mental illnesses are more likely to be victims, not perpetrators, of violence. And Michael Stone, a psychiatrist at Columbia University who maintains a database of mass shooters, wrote in a 2015 analysis that only 52 out of the 235 killers in the database, or about 22 percent, had mental illnesses. \u201cThe mentally ill should not bear the burden of being regarded as the \u2018chief\u2019 perpetrators of mass murder,\u201d he concluded. Other research has backed this up.\n\nThe problem, instead, is guns \u2014 and America\u2019s abundance of them.\n\nAs a breakthrough analysis by UC Berkeley\u2019s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins in 1999 found, it\u2019s not even that the US has more crime than other developed countries. This chart, from Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University, shows that the US is not an outlier when it comes to overall crime:\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Jeffrey Swanson and ICVS\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nInstead, the US appears to have more lethal violence \u2014 and that\u2019s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns.\n\n\u201dA series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,\u201d Zimring and Hawkins wrote. \u201cA preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Jeffrey Swanson and OECD\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThis is in many ways intuitive: People of every country get into arguments and fights with friends, family, and peers. But in the US, it\u2019s much more likely that someone will get angry at an argument and be able to pull out a gun and kill someone.\n\n3) The research shows that gun control works\nThe research also suggests that gun control can work. A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence \u2014 a strong indicator that restricting access to firearms can save lives.\n\nConsider Australia\u2019s example.\n\nIn 1996, a 28-year-old man walked into a cafe in Port Arthur, Australia, ate lunch, pulled a semiautomatic rifle out of his bag, and opened fire on the crowd, killing 35 people and wounding 23 more. It was the worst mass shooting in Australia\u2019s history.\n\nAustralian lawmakers responded with legislation that, among other provisions, banned certain types of firearms, such as automatic and semiautomatic rifles and shotguns. The Australian government confiscated 650,000 of these guns through a gun buyback program, in which it purchased firearms from gun owners. It established a registry of all guns owned in the country and required a permit for all new firearm purchases. (This is much further than bills typically proposed in the US, which almost never make a serious attempt to immediately reduce the number of guns in the country.)\n\nAustralia\u2019s firearm homicide rate dropped by about 42 percent in the seven years after the law passed, and its firearm suicide rate fell by 57 percent, according to a review of the evidence by Harvard researchers.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to know for sure how much of the drop in homicides and suicides was caused specifically by the gun buyback program. Australia\u2019s gun deaths, for one, were already declining before the law passed. But researchers David Hemenway and Mary Vriniotis argue that the gun buyback program very likely played a role: \u201cFirst, the drop in firearm deaths was largest among the type of firearms most affected by the buyback. Second, firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates per capita fell proportionately more than in states with lower buyback rates.\u201d\n\nOne study of the program, by Australian researchers, found that buying back 3,500 guns per 100,000 people correlated with up to a 50 percent drop in firearm homicides and a 74 percent drop in gun suicides. As Matthews explained, the drop in homicides wasn\u2019t statistically significant because Australia already had a pretty low number of murders. But the drop in suicides most definitely was \u2014 and the results are striking.\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Javier Zarracina/Vox\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nOne other fact, noted by Hemenway and Vriniotis in 2011: \u201cWhile 13 gun massacres (the killing of 4 or more people at one time) occurred in Australia in the 18 years before the [Australia gun control law], resulting in more than one hundred deaths, in the 14 following years (and up to the present), there were no gun massacres.\u201d\n\n4) State and local actions are not enough\nA common counterpoint to the evidence on gun control: If it works so well, why does Chicago have so much gun violence despite having some of the strictest gun policies in the US?\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made this argument after the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting: \u201cI think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country. That certainly hasn\u2019t helped there.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Chicago has fairly strict gun laws (although not the strictest). And it\u2019s true that the city has fairly high levels of gun violence (although also not the worst in the US).\n\nThis doesn\u2019t, however, expose the failure of gun control altogether, but rather the limit of leaving gun policies to a patchwork of local and state laws. The basic problem: If a city or state passes strict gun control measures, people can simply cross a border to buy guns in a jurisdiction with laxer laws.\n\nChicago, for example, requires a Firearm Owners Identification card, a background check, a three-day waiting period, and documentation for all firearm sales. But Indiana, across the border, doesn\u2019t require any of this for purchases between two private individuals (including those at gun shows and those who meet through the internet), allowing even someone with a criminal record to buy a firearm without passing a background check or submitting paperwork recording the sale.\n\nSo someone from Chicago can drive across the border \u2014 to Indiana or to other places with lax gun laws \u2014 and buy a gun without any of the big legal hurdles he would face at home. Then that person can resell or give guns to others in Chicago or keep them, leaving no paper trail behind. (This is illegal trafficking under federal law, but Indiana\u2019s lax laws and enforcement \u2014 particularly the lack of a paper trail \u2014 make it virtually impossible to catch someone until a gun is used in a crime.)\n\nThe result: According to a 2014 report from the Chicago Police Department, nearly 60 percent of the guns in crime scenes that were recovered and traced between 2009 and 2013 came from outside the state. About 19 percent came from Indiana \u2014 making it the most common state of origin for guns besides Illinois.\n\nThis isn\u2019t exclusive to Chicago. A 2016 report from the New York State Office of the Attorney General found that 74 percent of guns used in crimes in New York between 2010 and 2015 came from states with lax gun laws. (The gun trafficking chain from Southern states with weak gun laws to New York is so well-known it even has a name: \u201cthe Iron Pipeline.\u201d) And another 2016 report from the US Government Accountability Office found that most of the guns \u2014 as much as 70 percent \u2014 used in crimes in Mexico, which has strict gun laws, can be traced back to the US, which has generally weaker gun laws.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the stricter gun laws in Chicago, New York, or any other jurisdiction have no effect, but it does limit how far these local and state measures can go, since the root of the problem lies in other places\u2019 laws. The only way the pipeline could be stopped would be if all states individually strengthened their gun laws at once \u2014 or, more realistically, if the federal government passed a law that enforces stricter rules across the US.\n\n5) America probably needs to go further than anyone wants to admit\nAmerica\u2019s attention to gun control often focuses on a few specific measures: universal background checks, restrictions on people with mental illnesses buying firearms, and an assault weapons ban, for example. It is rare that American politicians, even on the left, go much further than that. Something like Australia\u2019s law \u2014 which amounts to a confiscation program \u2014 is never seriously considered.\n\nAs Dylan Matthews previously explained, this is a big issue. The US\u2019s gun problem is so dire that it arguably needs solutions that go way further than what we typically see in mainstream proposals \u2014 at least, if the US ever hopes to get down to European levels of gun violence.\n\nIf the fundamental problem is that America has far too many guns, then policies need to cut the number of guns in circulation right now to seriously reduce the number of gun deaths. Background checks and other restrictions on who can buy a gun can\u2019t achieve that in the short term. What America likely needs, then, is something more like Australia\u2019s mandatory buyback program \u2014 essentially, a gun confiscation scheme. \n\nBut no one in Congress is seriously proposing something that sweeping. The Manchin-Toomey bill, the only gun legislation in Congress after Sandy Hook that came close to becoming law, didn\u2019t even establish universal background checks. Recent proposals have been even milder, taking small steps like banning bump stocks or slightly improving the existing system for background checks.\n\nPart of the holdup is the Second Amendment. While there is reasonable scholarly debate about whether the Second Amendment actually protects all Americans\u2019 individual right to bear arms and prohibits stricter forms of gun control, the reality is the Supreme Court and US lawmakers widely agree that the Second Amendment does put barriers on how far restrictions can go. That would likely rule out anything like the Australian policy response short of a court reinterpretation or a repeal of the Second Amendment, neither of which seems likely.\n\nSo the US, for political, cultural, and legal reasons, seems to be unable to take the action that it really needs.\n\nNone of that is to say that milder measures are useless. Connecticut\u2019s law requiring gun purchasers to first obtain a license, for example, was followed by a 40 percent drop in gun homicides and a 15 percent reduction in suicides. Similar gains were seen in Missouri. It\u2019s difficult to separate these improvements from long-term trends (since gun homicides have generally been on the decline for decades now), but some of the decreases are likely linked to new restrictions on guns \u2014 and that means these measures truly saved lives.\n\nBut if America wants to get to the levels of gun deaths that its European peers report, it will likely need to go much further.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Emily Stewart", "body": "The White House is backing away from the gun control measures President Trump said he would back last month.\n\nThe administration unveiled Sunday its plan to combat school shootings following the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, in February that left 17 people dead. In the plan: a proposal to arm teachers. Not in it: a proposal to raise the age limit on buying certain assault rifles from 18 to 21.\n\nTrump calls on states to pass \u201crisk protection orders\u201d that allow law enforcement to take guns away from individuals they see as a threat to themselves or others, and pushes for Congress to pass two pieces of legislation on background checks and violence prevention programs. \n\nThe president is renewing his support for arming teachers and other school employees as well.\n\nThe White House will also create a federal task force to be led by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that will examine possible solutions for improving safety in schools \u2014 but the commission has no deadline for its findings. \n\n\u201cFar too often, the focus has been only on the most contentious fights, the things that have divided people and sent them into their entrenched corners,\u201d DeVos said on Sunday. \u201cBut the plan that we\u2019re going to advance and talk about is a pragmatic plan to dramatically increase school safety and to take steps to do so right away.\u201d\n\nRemember that gun control meeting in February? Trump apparently doesn\u2019t.\nPresident Trump in a meeting with lawmakers less than two weeks ago expressed openness to a lot of gun control measures that had Democrats cheering \u2014 while rightly skeptical of his declarations. \n\nHe expressed openness to raising the age for buying certain assault rifles to 21, supported a background check proposal from Sens. Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) that has twice failed in the Senate, and even seemed to express support for an assault weapons ban proposal from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). He said law enforcement should take firearms from individuals deemed dangerous and then go to court. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of the NRA,\u201d he told Toomey when he said his bill didn\u2019t address changing the gun purchase age limit.\n\nBut that Trump appears to have left the building. His administration\u2019s proposal is aiming at more low-hanging fruit:\n\n\nThe president will call on states to pass \u201crisk protection orders,\u201d temporary, court-issued orders that allow law enforcement to remove firearms from individuals who are a threat to themselves or others. They also prevent such individuals from buying new guns. \nThe president will urge Congress to pass the Fix NICS Act, a bipartisan bill sponsored by Sens. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Chris Murphy (D-CT). The legislation seeks to strengthen background checks by punishing federal agencies that don\u2019t submit criminal records to the national criminal background check system for firearms and by giving states financial incentives to report. \nTrump is also backing the STOP School Violence Act, which doesn\u2019t address guns but provides an annual grant to schools for \u201cevidence-based\u201d training programs and revamped reporting systems. \nThe administration will work with states to provide \u201crigorous firearms training to specially qualified volunteer school personnel.\u201d It will use existing Justice Department funding.\nThe White House will focus on increasing the \u201cintegration\u201d of mental health primary care and family services and support programs that use court-ordered treatment.\nThe administration will conduct a full audit and review of the FBI tip line. \n\nThe Justice Department on Saturday also formally submitted a rule to ban bump stocks, devices that can turn high-capacity rifles into automatic weapons. The rule would take months to implement if implemented at all, as there is debate as to whether the president can act on that front without Congress. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot Trump isn\u2019t doing\nTrump isn\u2019t endorsing the Toomey-Manchin proposal that would extend background checks on gun purchases made online. He certainly isn\u2019t calling for an assault weapons ban, and he\u2019s backed off of raising the age limit to 21. \n\nWhen asked by reporters on Sunday about Trump\u2019s change of tune, administration officials said the president wants Congress to \u201cact now,\u201d without obstruction. They said the age is a \u201cstate-based discussion going on right now\u201d and something the commission will look at. \n\nWhen asked about the president\u2019s February comments that his administration was going to \u201cwork on getting the age up to 21 and 18\u201d and said it \u201cdoesn\u2019t make sense\u201d that handguns can\u2019t be bought until 21 but assault weapons can, DeVos in an appearance on Today on Monday demurred. \u201cThe plan is really the first step in a more lengthy process, and the proposals that the president has put forward really encompass a lot of things that are supported on a broad bipartisan basis in Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is on the table.\u201d \n\nTrump in a string of tweets on Monday defended his administration\u2019s proposals. \n\n\n\nVery strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by White House.

In other words, they\u2019re going to give guns to teachers and hope it helps.\n\nThe proposal propels the narrative that a good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy with a gun \u2014 and one that is probably wrong. As Vox\u2019s German Lopez recently pointed out, there is no good research on the effect of arming teachers or the effect of putting more armed police or security in schools. And based on the evidence we do have, there\u2019s enough to suggest that putting more guns in schools could actually make gun violence worse. The problem in the US is that there are so many guns in circulation, making it easier for conflict to escalate to gun violence. More guns are likely to make the problem better, not worse. \n\nToday\u2019s Savannah Guthrie on Monday asked DeVos for specifics on the idea to arm teachers, and she repeatedly hedged on giving definitive answers. She said she did not have a \u201cpercentage\u201d in mind for how many teachers would need to be armed to be effective  in boosting security but didn\u2019t believe teachers in every classroom or every grade should have guns.\n\n\u201cThe point is that schools should have this tool if they choose to use the tool,\u201d DeVos said. \u201cCommunities should have the tools, states should have the tool, but nobody should be mandated to do it.\u201d\n\nTrump on Monday took a more aggressive tack and on Twitter said that arming teachers and guards would serve as a \u201cdeterrent.\u201d He suggested that schools that are gun-free zones are an \u201copen invitation\u201d for shooters to enter.\n\n\n\nIf schools are mandated to be gun free zones, violence and danger are given an open invitation to enter. Almost all school shootings are in gun free zones. Cowards will only go where there is no deterrent!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2018\n\n\n\n\nDeVos\u2019s commission will gather various stakeholders to discuss potential solutions. It has no deadline for its findings.\nAs for the school safety commission, DeVos said on Sunday in a call with reporters that she would bring together a \u201cwide array\u201d of education practitioners \u201cto help identify best practices and solutions that are working in communities and states across our country.\u201d She said they would focus on identifying risks early on, starting with social and emotional wellbeing and increased access, consistency, and transparency in mental health services.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when the commission will act. Senior administration officials said the matter is \u201curgent,\u201d but there\u2019s no deadline that would \u201cprevent it from being a deliberative process.\u201d An official said the public would \u201ccertainly see responses in under a year\u201d for the commission\u2019s recommendation.\n\nPresident Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday mocked \u201cblue-ribbon committees\u201d that do nothing but \u201ctalk, talk, talk,\u201d specifically referring to committees on opioids and drugs. When asked about why Trump thinks such committees are a bad idea for drugs but a good one for school safety, a senior administration official responded, \u201cWhy focus on a commission for this issue?\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Dylan Scott", "body": "He took shots at Congress, at Democrats, at the Senate\u2019s procedurals and promised that he would not sign another mega-spending package that is released at the last minute. But, this time, he did sign it.\n\nTrump\u2019s full remarks are below.\n\n\nThank you very much, everybody. We have a lot of good news to report. Some tremendous trade deals are being made with various countries. We\u2019re negotiating very long, very hard but very quickly. \n\nThe deal with South Korea, according to secretary Ross and Bob lighthizer, is very close to being finished, and we\u2019re going to have a wonderful deal with a wonderful ally. We\u2019re getting very close to it. It was a deal that was causing a lot of problems for our country in terms of employment and is very close to being finished, and we\u2019re going to have a wonderful deal with a wonderful ally. We\u2019re getting very close to it. It was a deal that was causing a lot of problems for our country in terms of employment and in terms of lots of other INGs. I might ask Secretary Ross to just say a few words about that, and then we\u2019re going to get on to this ridiculous situation that took place over the last week. So, secretary Ross?\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross\n\nThank you, Mr. President. We believe are relatively close to a pretty comprehensive resolution with the south Korean government. \n\nIt would encompass, if I goes through, both the 232s and broader trade issues. We hope sometime next week to be able to have a real announcement. \n\nDonald Trump\n\nThank you very much, Wilbur. I appreciate it. The last time we negotiated something like this, and as you know, it\u2019s always been a problem for our country. They get together and they create a series of documents that nobody has been able to read because it was just done. You tell me who can read that quickly. It takes a long time to read it. For the last eight years, deep defense cuts have undermined our national security. If you look at what\u2019s taken out, they hallowed our readiness as a military unit and put America at really grave risk. \n\nMy highest duty is to keep America safe. Nothing more important. \n\nThe omnibus bill reverses this dangerous defense as crazy as it\u2019s been, as difficult as it\u2019s been, as much opposition to the military as we\u2019ve had from the Democrats, and it has been tremendous. \n\nI tried to explain to them, the military is for Republicans and Democrats and for everybody else. But we have tremendous opposition to creating, really, what will be by far the strongest military that we\u2019ve ever had. \n\nWe\u2019ve had that from the Democrats. So if we take something for the military, they want something for, in many cases, things that are really a wasted sum of money. It\u2019s not right and it\u2019s very bad for our country. We\u2019re looking to do funding for our final fight in certain areas. As you know, we\u2019ve gotten just about 100% of our land back from ISIS. We have troop increases necessary to accomplish what we have to do, and we have, very importantly, a pay increase for our troops. \n\nAnd this will actually be the largest pay increase for our incredible people in over a decade. It increases total defense spending by more than $60 billion from last year and funds the addition ofritically needed ships, planes, helicopters, tanks and submarines. We have submarines being built the likes of which there is nothing anywhere in the world like the submarines we build. Our military equipment is the best equipment in the world. One of the things you saw two days ago with Saudi Arabia and with other countries, Saudi Arabia as an example is buying hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of our equipment. And we\u2019re getting very fast approvals on that. \n\nTherefore, as a matter of national security, I\u2019ve signed this omnibus budget bill. There are a lot of things I\u2019m unhappy about in this bill. There are a lot of things we shouldn\u2019t have had in this bill but we were, in a sense, forced if we want to build our military, we were forced to have. There are some things we should have in the bill. But I say to congress, I will never sign another bill like this again. I\u2019m not going to do it again. Nobody read it. It\u2019s only hours old. Some people don\u2019t even know -- it\u2019s $1.3 trillion. \n\nIt\u2019s the second largest ever. President Obama signed one that was actually larger, which I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t too happy with, either. But in this case it became so big because we need to take care of our military. And because the Democrats, who don\u2019t believe in that, added things that they wanted in order to get their votes. We have to get rid of the filibuster rule. We have to get rid of the filibuster rule and go to 51 votes in the senate if we\u2019re going to have really sustained, continued success. DACA recipients have been treated extremely badly by the Democrats. We wanted to include DACA. We wanted to have them in this bill. 800,000 people. \n\nAnd actually, it could even be more. And we wanted to include DACA in this bill. The Democrats would not do it. They would not do it. To prevent the omnibus situation from ever happening again, I\u2019m calling on congress to give me a line item veto for a government spending bills, and the senate must end. \n\nThey must end the filibuster rule and get down to work. Have to get a lot of great legislation approved, and without the filibuster rule, it will happen just like magic. I want to address the situation on border security, which I call national defense. I call it stopping drugs from pouring across our border. And I call it illegal immigration. It\u2019s all of those things. But national defense is a very important two words, because by having a strong border system, including a wall, we are in a position militarily that is very advantageous. And before I get off of that subject, I would like to ask secretary Mattis to talk about what we\u2019ve accomplished in terms of the military, because there has never been anything like we\u2019ve been able to do. Our military is very depleted but it\u2019s rapidly getting better, and in a short period of time it will be stronger than it\u2019s ever been. I would like Secretary Mattis to say a few words, please. \n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis:\n\nThank you, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. In 1790 in George Washington\u2019s first annual address to congress, he stated to be prepared for war is one of the most effective means of preserving the peace. As the President noted, today we received the largest military budget in history reversing many years of decline and unpredictable funding. And together we are going to make our military stronger than ever. We in the military are humbled and grateful to the American people for their sacrifices on behalf of this funding. \n\nNow it\u2019s our responsibility in the military to spend every dollar wisely in order to keep the trust and the confidence of the American people and the congress. Thank you.\n\nDonald Trump:\n\nThank you very much, general. The border we\u2019ve worked very hard on. We have a lot of, really by any standard a lot, but not by this standard, but we\u2019re going to make it go a long way. There\u2019s a lot of money coming to the border and it will be coming in a period of time. We funded the initial down payment of $106,000, but we\u2019ll be start work literally on Monday on not only some new wall -- not enough but we\u2019re working on that very quickly -- but also fixing existing walls and fixing acceptable fences. You have to be able to see through the other side to see what\u2019s coming. In many cases it\u2019s not a ptty picture when you look. \n\nBut you have to be able to see it. So we have $1.6 billion for the wall. That will start immediately. But you have to be able to see it. So we have $1.6 billion for the wall. That will start immediately. This is a short-term funding but it\u2019s immediate, starts immediately, and I\u2019d like to ask Secretary Nielsen to say a few words about what we\u2019ve done in terms of homeland security and what the bill does for homeland security. Thank you. \n\nHomeland Security Secretary Nielsen\n\nGood afternoon. We at the department of homeland security work very closely with the department of defense and we support this omnibus in the defense of our country. As the president has stated, under his leadership he has delivered for the Americans. This is for American enforcement. This will help us with our aviation security with some badly needed upgrades, and we look forward to working with congress on some additional needs that we have. \n\nI will say, however, it\u2019s unfortunate that congress chose not to listen to the security on the front lines. We will continue to make sure the wall is where we need it, how we need it as the president described and to make sure it serves the American people and the security of this nation. We will also work with congress to close the dangerous loopholes that the president has mentioned many times and to continue to increase our overall security. And finally, we thank those in congress who support the department of homeland security. I will continue to make myself available to them. I look forward to working with them, but we must fund the department and give it the tools and resources it needs to execute the mission the American people have asked us to do. Thank you. \n\nDonald Trump\n\nThank you very much, Secretary. So we have many elements in the bill that we wanted. Just to look at a few of them, we\u2019re providing $654.6 billion in total discretionary funding for defense. It\u2019s a record. All records for defense. There will be nobody that says that our military is going to be depleted like they\u2019ve been saying over the last long period of time. Long period of time. Frankly, beyond president Obama. That won\u2019t be happening. We\u2019re spending a lot of money on nuclear, our nuclear systems, to upgrade, and in some cases, brand new, whether it\u2019s submarines, nuclear submarines and others. So we\u2019ll have by far the most powerful nuclear force on Earth, and it will be absolutely in perfect shape and condition, and hopefully, praise be to god we don\u2019t ever have to use it. But there will be nobody that\u2019s even close. \n\nThis will give a substantial increase to people even outside of the military, but military related. Some of the many things that we\u2019re buying in the military, we have $23.8 billion to procure 34 Navy ships. Our Navy is at about the lowest point in terms of ships that it\u2019s been in over 100 years. And we\u2019re adding a significant number of extremely advanced vessels. $10.2 billion for 90 f-35 aircraft. That\u2019s the most sophisticated aircraft in the world, jet fighters. They\u2019re hard to find, they\u2019re hard to see, therefore they\u2019re hard to beat. It\u2019s very tough to beat a plane when you can\u2019t see it. This is the most advanced in the world. 10.2 billion for 90 f-35. We have 2.9 billion for 15 kc-46 tanker aircraft. \n\nThe tanker aircraft is very important based on everything. It allows our planes to travel anywhere in the world without landing. 1.8 billion for 24 fa-18F super hornet aircraft fighter jets. 1.7 billion for 10 pa -- the poseidons. Incredible stuff. 1 billion for the black hawk helicopter, fighting machine. 1.1 billion for the upgrade of 85 Abrams tanks. \n\n75 million for the cooperative programs that we\u2019re working with Israel and others on various missile defense systems. We\u2019re spending a lot of money on missile defense. We have a lot of defense that\u2019s been recently installed. \n\nWe\u2019re spending tremendous money on missile defense. You understand what that means? Everybody does. With what we have out there, missile defense is very very important. We are funding our border patrol agents and our I.C.E. Agents. They are working long hours under tremendously dangerous conditions. \n\nWe\u2019re adding large numbers of immigration judges, high quality judges. Not only are we adding them in the district court level and the federal level of court of appeals, but we\u2019re adding immigration judges at a very high level.\n\nSo while we\u2019re very disappointed in the 1.3 trillion, there\u2019s nobody more disappointed than me because the number is so large, we\u2019ll start coming down. We had no choice but to fund our military because we have to have by far the strongest military in the world. And this will be by far the strongest military that we\u2019ve ever had. So when you look all of these pages, a lot of that is devoted -- a lot -- to the military. \n\nI just want to thank members of congress for working so hard. While we can be disappointed in some ways, we have to also know that there are a lot of strings pulling everybody in different directions. \n\nThe Republican senators, the Republican congressmen and women have been steadfast in their fight for the border and steadfast for their fight on the military. We\u2019re also spending $6 billion on, as you know, various forms of drug control, helping people that are addicted. It\u2019s terrible problem, but this will be also -- this will be a record. We\u2019ll be suing certain drug companies for what they\u2019ve done with the opioids and we\u2019ll be bringing the suits at a federal level. The level of drugs that are being put out there and the power of this addiction is hard to believe. People go to the hospital for a period of a week and they come out and they\u2019re drug addicts. There has to be a better way. Doctors are way down now in their orders of the opioids, way down. It\u2019s a great thing. \n\nWe\u2019re also looking for, in our research funds, we\u2019re looking for a medicine that can stop the pain without the addiction so at people aren\u2019t going to become addicted to these incredible drugs. That\u2019s part of what we have. We\u2019re going to have $6 billion having to do with opioids and other problems that this country, and in fact the world, is having with drugs. So we\u2019re extremely proud of what we\u2019ve been able to do when it comes to our military. Our military will be far superior than to any military anywhere in the world. That\u2019s very import for us. You see the players out there, you see what we\u2019re dealing with. We are very happy with what\u2019s happened with opioids. We\u2019re very happy with what\u2019s happened with certain elements of the border. \n\nNot happy with $1.6 billion, but it does start the wall and we\u2019ll make that $1.6 billion go very far. I can say this, and I say this to DACA recipients. The Republicans are with you, they want to get your situation taken care of. The Democrats just fought every single inch of the way. They did not want DACA in this bill. And as you know, DACA is also tied to the wall for the major funding, the $25 billion for the wall and other things. So I think that will be coming up very soon. But I do want the hispanic community to know and DACA recipients to know that Republicans are much more on your side than the Democrats who are using you for their own purposes. \n\nWith that being said, I just want to thank everybody for being here. We\u2019re very proud of many of the items that we\u2019ve been able to get. We\u2019re very disappointed that in order to fund the military, we had to give up things where we consider, in many cases, them to be bad or them to be a waste of money. But that\u2019s the way, unfortunately, right now the system works. But we have a great country. We are going to have the greatest military we\u2019ve ever had, and lots of good things are happening. The trade situation we\u2019ll be talking about next week. \n\nHave many trade deals, not only a deal being made on south Korea which looks like it\u2019s very close to being finalized, but many other countries are now negotiating fair trade deals with us. So we\u2019ll be rolling them out as you see them. Part of the reason, frankly, that we\u2019re able to do that is the fact that we have the tariffs on steel and the tariffs on aluminum. Because it showed how unfair some of these trade deals that have been in existence for many years, how unfair they\u2019ve been. So it will be great for our country, and frankly, it will also be great for other countries. And it will be fair and it will be reciprocal. Thank you all very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Tara Golshan", "body": "Democrats want to make Texas blue \u2014 or at the very least, purple \u2014 and a massive surge in voter enthusiasm is giving them hope.\n\nEarly vote totals for Texas\u2019s midterm election primary\u2019s are looking good for Democrats, who are showing extremely high levels of enthusiasm. Democratic turnout has increased by 90 percent compared to the 2014 midterms and is even above the 2016 presidential election year levels. Republican early voter turnout is up by 17 percent from 2014, but still lagging behind 2016 turnout. \n\nWith a primary Election Day on Tuesday that will determine the Democratic and Republican frontrunners for all 36 congressional districts, a US Senate seat, and a governor\u2019s office, Democrats are hoping this early surge of energy among their base can carry through to November.\n\nThe energy is beginning to spook Republicans in the state. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is up for reelection, and his campaign told supporters the energy \u201cshould shock every conservative to their core.\u201d\n\nAt a GOP event, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) told supporters Democrats would \u201ccrawl over broken glass in November to vote,\u201d warning that Republicans \u201ccould get obliterated at the polls.\u201d \n\nTo be sure, early voting numbers don\u2019t dictate the outcome of elections (Hillary Clinton\u2019s early voting totals also looked pretty good going into Election Day), and November is still a long ways away. But in a state notorious for having some of the worst voter turnout in the country, this is a major sign that Democrats are motivated to get out to the polls.\n\nWhat we can \u2014 and cannot \u2014 take away from the early voting numbers\nEarly voting numbers aren\u2019t a good indicator of election outcomes, but they are a strong measure of voter enthusiasm; lots of early voters means lots of decided voters.\n\nAnd in Texas\u2019s biggest counties, Democrats are even surpassing their early voting numbers from the 2016 primaries, a presidential year. (Midterm election years usually see depressed voter turnout.) The state hasn\u2019t tracked early voting in smaller, more rural counties, where Republicans likely have a much larger advantage. \n\nEven so, the action is definitely putting Republicans on their toes. Democrats have already won several deeply red state special elections around the country and come close in several others. Their high fundraising numbers also can\u2019t be overlooked. Democratic favorite Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX), who\u2019s aiming to challenge Cruz in November, has already out-fundraised the Republican incumbent.\n\nMore participation in primary elections doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate with higher voter turnout in general elections. Republicans could \u2014 and have in the past \u2014 turned out in much higher numbers in the general election than in the primary. But there\u2019s no question that enthusiasm is high among Democrats. This means that in November they\u2019ll need to keep up their voter mobilization efforts in urban counties if they have any hope of winning over some Republican congressional seats.\n\nAs Vox\u2019s Ella Nilsen explained, Democrats are eyeing three districts in Texas for November \u2014 around Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio \u2014 all of which Hillary Clinton carried by a couple points in 2016 and have the potential to flip blue.\n\nDemocrats are banking on President Donald Trump\u2019s unpopularity to push people to the polls. And Republicans are taking the threat seriously. Trump\u2019s favorability in Texas isn\u2019t as high as a state with a deeply red reputation would suggest. In February, 78 percent of Democrats found Trump to be very unfavorable and only 53 percent of Republicans found Trump to be \u201cvery favorable.\u201d\n\nTexas is known for having terrible voter turnout\nHistorically, Texas has consistently ranked among the lowest voter turnout in the country.\n\nThe depressed electoral participation has been attributed to a host of reasons in the past, from acts of voter suppression to unmotivated voters. In 2010, slightly more than a third of eligible Texas voters decided the governor\u2019s race. Fewer than 30 percent voted in the 2014 midterm cycle\u2019s general election.\n\nBut as Texas Tribune\u2019s Alexa Ura and Ryan Murphy point out, Texas\u2019s turnout is also tied deeply to demographics:\n\n\nHopes for a swell in voter turnout often hinge on the state\u2019s burgeoning Hispanic population. But a breakdown of the population by age shows a third of Texas Hispanics aren\u2019t even of voting age. In fact, those under 18 make up the state\u2019s largest Hispanic age group. Meanwhile, those aged 45 to 64 make up the biggest age group of white Texans.\n\nTo be clear, Hispanic adults participate in elections at lower rates than their white and black counterparts overall, which makes them an easy target for voter mobilization efforts. But when it comes to convincing Hispanic voters to play a bigger role in elections, it doesn\u2019t help that they\u2019re already starting from behind.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, Texas\u2019s older population is much more likely to participate in elections than the young population, with the largest turnout from voters 65 years old and up. So while Texas is a young state, older Texans make up most of the vote.\n\nDemocrats are hoping Trump\u2019s unique unpopularity \u2014 and his targeted attacks toward the Hispanic population \u2014 can be enough to change the tide. \n\nThe enthusiasm for the primaries is proving to be some encouragement.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Andrew Prokop", "body": "Stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one. A Russian oligarch, a top Russian government official, and a high-end escort take a trip together on a yacht. Months later, after being thrown into a Thai prison, the escort claims she knows about secret Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. And she says she has tapes.\n\nIt sounds utterly absurd. And, to be clear, Anastasia Vashukevich (who also goes by the name Nastya Rybka) may not actually have anything close to what she claims she does. She\u2019s clearly self-interested \u2014 she\u2019s trying to avoid deportation back to her home country of Belarus and is asking the US to extradite her in exchange for her information. She also has a history of bizarre self-promotional stunts.\n\nBut Vashukevich\u2019s claims have been getting a surprising amount of attention from mainstream media sources \u2014 and for some understandable reasons.\n\nFor one, that wasn\u2019t just any oligarch she traveled with. It was Russian aluminum magnate and former Paul Manafort employer Oleg Deripaska. That\u2019s the oligarch whom Manafort wanted to privately brief and with whom he seems to have surreptitiously communicated, through an intermediary, while he chaired Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nFor another, it wasn\u2019t just any top Russian government official who accompanied them on Deripaska\u2019s yacht \u2014 it was Sergei Prikhodko, Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister, a longtime Putin ally who has a foreign policy portfolio and is a very high-ranking official indeed.\n\nFinally, the idea that Vashukevich might have secretly taped their conversations isn\u2019t just hypothetical. At least once, she clearly did it, recording the two men as Deripaska discussed US-Russia relations. She later posted the video on her public Instagram account, where it sat for many months, essentially unnoticed, until anti-corruption political activist and Putin critic Alexei Navalny discovered it and explained its import in a YouTube video, accusing the deputy prime minister of accepting bribes from the oligarch.\n\nNow, whether Vashukevich actually has 16 more hours of such recordings, as she says, and whether they are as damning as she claims, are different questions \u2014 ones we can\u2019t answer yet. But this saga has already had major ramifications \u2014 it\u2019s spurred the Russian government to block Navalny\u2019s website just weeks before Russia\u2019s presidential election, and to threaten to block YouTube and Instagram entirely in Russia as well.\n\nFurthermore, all this revives yet again the many unanswered questions of just what Manafort was really up to during the Trump campaign. Emails between Manafort and a business associate make clear that Manafort, who was badly indebted to Deripaska, wanted to use his newfound prominence to \u201cget whole.\u201d The emails also appear to reference Manafort\u2019s associate having a lengthy meeting with Deripaska and bringing back important messages. They also reference \u201ccaviar\u201d \u2014 an apparent code for money \u2014 in relation to him. And all this unfolded just days before this very voyage.\n\nVashukevich\u2019s Instagram corroborates her yacht trip\n\nBack in early August 2016, at the height of the US presidential campaign, the oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, and the deputy Russian prime minister, Sergei Prikhodko, took a multi-day yacht trip together off the coast of Norway. They invited several high-end escorts along for the trip, including Anastasia Vashukevich of Belarus, who was about 19 years old at the time.\n\nVashukevich, a frequent social media user, Instagrammed her trip, posting photos and video, apparently unbeknownst to the two men. In one video snippet she posted as part of a montage several months later, the men talk United States relations, and Deripaska says the following (according to a translation provided in Navalny\u2019s video):\n\nWe\u2019ve got bad relations with America, because the friend of Sergey Eduardovich [Prikhodko], Nuland\u2019s her name, is responsible for them. When she was your age, she\u2019s spent a month on a Russian whaling boat. She hates our country after this. Why is that?\n\nThe \u201cshe\u201d is in reference to Victoria Nuland, who was President Obama\u2019s top State Department official overseeing Russian relations and was loathed by many in the Russian government (a diplomatically embarrassing private conversation she had was once taped and leaked). In and of itself, Deripaska\u2019s remark here is hardly a bombshell \u2014 but it does tell us that Deripaska was willing to talk about such topics in front of Vashukevich.\n\nVashukevich\u2019s public Instagram posts of the yacht trip remained unnoticed for more than a year. (Here\u2019s her feed, which is NSFW.) In that time, she wrote a book called Who Wants to Seduce a Billionaire describing what she says was her affair with an oligarch, including a  detailed description of a yacht trip with him and a top politician (though she didn\u2019t name either man). Eventually, she went public in the Russian media about her affair with Deripaska.\n\nAll this seemed like a salacious but inconsequential story \u2014 until Vashukevich got the attention of Alexei Navalny.\n\nA leading Putin critic unraveled this tangled tale in a YouTube video\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Alexei Navalny awaits release in 2014.\n      \n      \n        Dmitry Serebryakov/AFP/Getty\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nAlexei Navalny, a lawyer, media commentator, and activist, is one of Russia\u2019s most high-profile critics of Vladimir Putin. He\u2019s organized demonstrations, exposed apparent corruption, and faced charges from the government, and he tried to challenge Putin for president in 2018 before his campaign was blocked by electoral authorities.\n\nOne day in September 2017, Vashukevich and a group of other scantily dressed women came by Navalny\u2019s campaign headquarters, at the same time as a camera crew, in an apparent attempt to cause an embarrassing scene for him. \n\nCurious who this group was and what they were up to, Navalny and his team researched them \u2014 and eventually disclosed their findings in a highly entertaining 25-minute YouTube video (it\u2019s in Russian but has English subtitles, and my quotes are from those subtitles). \u201cThey are some mildly insane activists who, either for money or for the show, take part in some highly unusual events,\u201d Navalny said. \n\nFor instance, just weeks after their activity at Navalny\u2019s office, Vashukevich and four other women stood nearly naked outside the US Embassy in what they claimed was a demonstration in support of Harvey Weinstein. One had \u201cLove you Harvey\u201d written on her body, another \u201cFuck me Harvey.\u201d (Naturally, Vashukevich Instagrammed it.) \n\nIn another video, Vashukevich said, \u201cI want to address Alexei Navalny. Alex, one of us will find you and fuck you and post the video of it on the internet. Because of you and those like you, people keep fighting wars now.\u201d Then in February, Vashukevich traveled to Thailand, where she began participating in a \u201csex seminar.\u201d\n\nAfter combing social media posts and reviewing Vashukevich\u2019s book, Navalny\u2019s team unraveled basically all of the truly bizarre tale laid out above \u2014 and realized just who was with Vashukevich on that Instagrammed yacht trip. Navalny\u2019s interest was in documenting and denouncing what he alleged was the blatant corruption and bribery of Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister. \n\nHis video caused an earthquake. Deripaska sued in a Russian court to try to get YouTube to take down Navalny\u2019s video, and to get either Instagram or Vashukevich to take down her posts of him. And a Russian government watchdog agency threatened to block all of YouTube and Instagram in Russia over the matter. Eventually, Vashukevich deleted some of her Instagram posts and Instagram agreed to take down the others. And while YouTube hasn\u2019t removed Navalny\u2019s video, the Russian government blocked Navalny\u2019s website in the country.\n\nBut then Vashukevich was arrested \u2014 and she claims to have more recordings proving Russian meddling in the US election\n\nThat\u2019s where things stood \u2014 until February 25, when Vashukevich and several others participating in her \u201csex seminar\u201d were arrested in Thailand for apparently completely unrelated reasons. (The New York Times reports that \u201cseveral attendees said that no sex had been involved\u201d in the seminar, and that it was instead about \u201cimproving communication and on perfecting the art of seduction.\u201d) \n\nVashukevich, who has posted Instagram videos and photos documenting her prison experience, is potentially facing deportation because she lacks a work permit. So she has gone public, alleging that she has secret knowledge of Russian interference in the US presidential election \u2014 and that she fears she wouldn\u2019t be safe if deported back to Russia or Belarus. An associate of hers who was also arrested wrote a letter to the United States seeking political asylum for the group, saying, \u201cWe have important information for USA and we risk our lives very much.\u201d\n\nThe Times\u2019s Richard Paddock then interviewed the detained Vashukevich this week, and she claimed she had more than 16 hours of audio recordings from her trip with Deripaska and Prikhodko. \u201cIf America gives me protection, I will tell everything I know,\u201d she said. \u201cI am afraid to go back to Russia. Some strange things can happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were discussing elections,\u201d she went on. \u201cDeripaska had a plan about elections.\u201d And she claimed they had conversations with three people who spoke English fluently and who she thought were Americans. (Again, we don\u2019t know whether this is true or self-serving.)\n\nThe reason Vashukevich\u2019s claims could matter: Paul Manafort and Oleg Deripaska seem to have been in contact right before her trip\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Drew Angerer/Getty\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nLeaving aside Vashukevich\u2019s claims, which are currently very far from proven, there are still many questions about Paul Manafort and whether he tried to make contact with Oleg Deripaska while he was also chairing Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. (Manafort has since been indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team, but not in relation to this.)\n\nDeripaska was an old client of Manafort\u2019s \u2014 in fact, the connected oligarch was one of Manafort\u2019s first clients in what proved to be a very lucrative line of business in Russia and Eastern Europe. But things went awry between the two \u2014 they had a falling-out that ended in a lawsuit, with Deripaska claiming Manafort cheated him of millions.\n\nSo when the badly indebted Manafort got a high-profile job advising Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in March 2016, Manafort saw an opportunity. He emailed his business associate Konstantin Kilimnik in early April about his newly high media profile, writing, \u201cHow do we use to get whole,\u201d and \u201cHas OVD operation seen?\u201d (These are Deripaska\u2019s initials.)\n\nThen in July, Manafort and Kilimnik exchanged emails about Deripaska again, as the Washington Post and the Atlantic reported last year. \u201cI am carefully optimistic on the issue of our biggest interest,\u201d Kilimnik said. \u201cHe will be most likely looking for ways to reach out to you pretty soon.\u201d Manafort wrote that if Deripaska \u201cneeds private briefings we can accommodate.\u201d\n\nThe pair\u2019s emails on the topic grew vaguer and more cryptic as the summer continued. In late July, Kilimnik wrote to Manafort, \u201cI met today with the guy who gave you your biggest black caviar jar several years ago. We spent about 5 hours talking about his story, and I have several important messages from him to you.\u201d This, again, is believed to be about Deripaska, with \u201ccaviar\u201d thought to be code for money.\n\nKilimnik and Manafort arranged a meeting in New York City to discuss the matter on August 2 \u2014 Kilimnik wrote that he had a \u201clong caviar story\u201d to tell and \u201cseveral important messages.\u201d (They have claimed this meeting was unrelated to the US presidential campaign.)\n\nDeripaska took the now-infamous yacht trip with Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister a few days after this. \n\nManafort, unexpectedly, didn\u2019t end up lasting much longer on the Trump campaign \u2014 he was fired on August 19. But there are still a great many questions about what, exactly, happened between him, Kilimnik, and Deripaska beforehand.\n\nFurthermore, as Navalny points out, Vashukevich\u2019s posts provide what had been a missing link in this particular collusion theory. Navalny says in his video that though Deripaska was viewed as close to Putin, many oligarchs are, and the theory always lacked any indication that \u201cDeripaska transmits any information to him.\u201d\n\nYet now we know that just days after Deripaska seems to have had a very important conversation with Manafort\u2019s associate and sent important messages, Deripaska took a multi-day yacht trip with one of the highest-level officials in the Russian government, in which they discussed politics and the United States.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is surely very curious about the content of those discussions.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Emily Stewart", "body": "This week, Facebook looks like it\u2019s trying to give Russia the benefit of the doubt. Rob Goldman, vice president of ads at Facebook, used Twitter on Friday to applaud Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s indictments of multiple Russian people and companies for their interference in the 2016 election. Goldman said he also wanted to clear a few things up \u2014namely, that he doesn\u2019t believe that Russia\u2019s main goal was to sway the 2016 election. On Sunday, however, James Clapper, former director of national intelligence under the Obama administration, clapped back: of course Russia was trying to influence the election. Obviously both can\u2019t be true. \nGoldman\u2019s reasoning was based on the fact that a majority of Russian ad spending on Facebook happened after the election. \u201cThe main goal of the Russian propaganda and misinformation effort is to divide America by using our institutions, like free speech and social media, against us. It has stoked fear and hatred amongst Americans,\u201d Goldman wrote. \u201cIt is working incredibly well. We are quite divided as a nation.\u201d he wrote. The executive pointed to a Houston anti-Islamic protest in May: \u201cAmericans were literally puppeted into the streets by trolls who organized both sides of the protest,\u201d he said. President Donald Trump picked up on Goldman\u2019s thread on Saturday.\n\n\n\u201cI have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal.\u201dRob GoldmanVice President of Facebook Ads https://t.co/A5ft7cGJkE\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2018\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, to Clapper \u2014 a retired lieutenant general in the Air Force who was director of national intelligence under Obama and served in the Bush and Clinton administrations as well \u2014 Goldman\u2019s logic is na\u00efve. In an appearance on CNN\u2019s State of the Union with Dana Bash on Saturday, the general hit back at Goldman\u2019s assertion. \u201cWell, it\u2019s false, as far as I\u2019m concerned, because there\u2019s no question what the Russians were trying to do,\u201d Clapper said, noting that all evidence points to that being the case, whether you want to acknowledge it or not. \u201cClearly, the Russians were trying to affect the election.\u201d\nClapper said the Russians had three main goals in their campaign to interfere in American politics: \nFirst was simply to sow discord and discontent in this country. And, unfortunately, we\u2019re a good target for that right now. And, secondly, to hurt Hillary Clinton, which starts with this strong personal animus that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has for the Clintons, both, and then, of course, as things evolved, to support Trump.\nThere is one thing, however, that Clapper and Goldman seem to agree on: Russia is definitely going to try it again. \u201cThe Russian campaign is ongoing,\u201d Goldman wrote on Twitter on Friday. \u201cThey\u2019re going to continue to do it,\u201d Clapper said on Sunday.\nClapper also said he believes that more revelations are coming: \u201cI do think there are other shoes to drop here besides this indictment.\u201d", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}, {"author": "Andrew Prokop", "body": "It\u2019s now clear that special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation is now looking into a whole lot more than just Russia.\n\nA set of recent reports citing witnesses interviewed in Mueller\u2019s probe all suggest that the special counsel is pursuing angles related to potentially corrupt foreign influence on a wide range of people in Trump\u2019s orbit \u2014 with the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Turkey, and China all being mentioned as subjects of his investigators\u2019 questioning.\n\nFirst, CNN\u2019s Shimon Prokupecz, Kara Scannell, and Gloria Borger reported that Mueller was looking into Jared Kushner\u2019s efforts to get foreign investors for his family real estate company\u2019s projects during the transition \u2014 and that his investigators have asked witnesses about Kushner\u2019s talks with a Chinese insurance company and with a former prime minister of Qatar. \n\nThen, NBC News\u2019s Carol Lee, Julia Ainsley, and Robert Windrem reported that Mueller\u2019s team has also asked about Kushner\u2019s conversations with potential investors from Russia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 with an eye toward whether these business talks \u201clater shaped White House policies.\u201d (The report claims that Qatari officials claim to have evidence that Kushner coordinated with Gulf states to hurt Qatar, but have \u201cdecided against cooperating with Mueller for now out of fear it would further strain the country\u2019s relations with the White House.\u201d)\n\nThen, this weekend, the New York Times\u2019 Mark Mazzetti, David Kirkpatrick, and Maggie Haberman reported that businessman George Nader, an adviser to the United Arab Emirates government who visited the White House several times last year, had become a focus of Mueller\u2019s probe. Investigators have specifically asked \u201cabout any possible attempts by the Emiratis to buy political influence by directing money to support Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign,\u201d the Times reports.\n\nFinally, Axios\u2019s Jonathan Swan got a hold of a grand jury subpoena Mueller\u2019s team sent to a witness this February. The subpoena demands \u201call communications\u201d this person sent or received involving not only Trump himself, but nine other named Trump associates since November 1, 2015. In addition to the fact that the subpoena names many people, note that it is not limited in any way to Russia-related communications. \n\nAll this paints a picture of a very wide-ranging investigation that\u2019s investigating not just Russian interference with the 2016 campaign and Russian ties to Trump, but potentially corrupt foreign influence involving a wide circle of Trump associates.\n\nIs all this mainly about getting more leverage for the Russia case \u2014 or is Mueller pursuing something else big?\nNow, Mueller\u2019s investigation had already gone somewhat beyond Russia collusion, with last October\u2019s indictments of Paul Manafort and Rick Gates on charges based on work they did for Ukrainian politicians before the 2016 campaign. But Manafort and Gates worked for the faction of Ukrainian politicians aligned with the Kremlin, so this wasn\u2019t all that far removed from Russia. The recent reports indicate a far broader focus (though other reports make clear he\u2019s still also looking into the central question of Russian interference, too).\n\nThe big mystery, though, is whether Mueller is focusing on all these other topics mainly out of a desire to help him make a Russia-related case \u2014 or whether potential corruption related to Gulf countries and other foreign players are now a new focus in his investigation in and of itself.\n\nThe Manafort and Gates Ukraine charges, for instance, were widely believed to be pursued by Mueller\u2019s team primarily because he wanted one or both of them to \u201cflip\u201d (as Gates eventually did). So perhaps these new areas of inquiry are mainly aimed at getting more leverage over Trump associates, so they\u2019d feel pressure to cooperate and provide valuable Russia-related information. \n\nAlternatively, Mueller could have discovered something big in his investigation unrelated to Russia \u2014 through records he\u2019s uncovered, witnesses, or perhaps his three cooperating ex-Trump aides \u2014 that seems serious and important enough to merit him devoting his resources to it. \n\nBoth seem like possibilities. Mueller has 17 prosecutors on his team, so he can look into many things at the same time. Still, he hardly has unlimited resources, and the Russian interference topic is enormously complex. But whether his team is asking these questions to get Russia-related leverage, or to look into what could be an entirely new scandal, it\u2019s clear there\u2019s some reason behind it. Only the special counsel\u2019s team, however, knows what that is.", "link": null, "source": "Vox", "location": [{"country": "US", "state": null, "city": null}]}]
